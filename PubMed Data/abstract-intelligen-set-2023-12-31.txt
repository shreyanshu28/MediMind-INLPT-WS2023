The search for existing non-animal alternative methods for use in experiments is 
currently challenging because of the lack of both comprehensive structured 
databases and balanced keyword-based search strategies to mine unstructured 
textual databases. In this paper we describe 3Ranker, which is a fast, 
keyword-independent algorithm for finding non-animal alternative methods for use 
in biomedical research. The 3Ranker algorithm was created by using a machine 
learning approach, consisting of a Random Forest model built on a dataset of 35 
million abstracts and constructed with weak supervision, followed by iterative 
model improvement with expert curated data. We found a satisfactory trade-off 
between sensitivity and specificity, with Area Under the Curve (AUC) values 
ranging from 0.85-0.95. Trials showed that the AI-based classifier was able to 
identify articles that describe potential alternatives to animal use, among the 
thousands of articles returned by generic PubMed queries on dermatitis and 
Parkinson's disease. Application of the classification models on time series 
data showed the earlier implementation and acceptance of Three Rs principles in 
the area of cosmetics and skin research, as compared to the area of 
neurodegenerative disease research. The 3Ranker algorithm is freely available at 
www.open3r.org; the future goal is to expand this framework to cover multiple 
research domains and to enable its broad use by researchers, policymakers, 
funders and ethical review boards, in order to promote the replacement of animal 
use in research wherever possible.

Artificial intelligence is increasingly used in the field of medicine as a 
diagnostic aid, particularly for image analysis and more generally for data 
processing. Many artificial intelligence-based tools have been specifically 
developed for clinical biology, but some more general ones can help to improve 
the dissemination of medical knowledge. To test whether and to what extent an 
automated conversation tool could answer questions on a clinical biology topic 
(i.e. prostate cancer biomarkers), we questioned ChatGPT, an artificial 
intelligence-powered model dedicated to optimize language models for dialogue. 
Then we analyzed its responses.

Intraoperative margin analysis is crucial for the successful removal of 
cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (cSCC). Artificial intelligence technologies 
(AI) have previously demonstrated potential for facilitating rapid and complete 
tumour removal using intraoperative margin assessment for basal cell carcinoma. 
However, the varied morphologies of cSCC present challenges for AI margin 
assessment. The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate the accuracy of an 
AI algorithm for real-time histologic margin analysis of cSCC. To do this, a 
retrospective cohort study was conducted using frozen cSCC section slides. These 
slides were scanned and annotated, delineating benign tissue structures, 
inflammation and tumour to develop an AI algorithm for real-time margin 
analysis. A convolutional neural network workflow was used to extract 
histomorphological features predictive of cSCC. This algorithm demonstrated 
proof of concept for identifying cSCC with high accuracy, highlighting the 
potential for integration of AI into the surgical workflow. Incorporation of AI 
algorithms may improve efficiency and completeness of real-time margin 
assessment for cSCC removal, particularly in cases of moderately and poorly 
differentiated tumours/neoplasms. Further algorithmic improvement incorporating 
surrounding tissue context is necessary to remain sensitive to the unique 
epidermal landscape of well-differentiated tumours, and to map tumours to their 
original anatomical position/orientation.

BACKGROUND: Despite recent significant strides towards acceptance, inclusion, 
and equality, members of the queer community still face alarming mental health 
disparities, being almost up to three times more likely to suffer from 
depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts compared with their heterosexual 
counterparts. These unique psychological challenges are due to discrimination, 
stigmatization, and identity-related struggles, and can potentially benefit from 
generative conversational Artificial Intelligence (AI). As the latest 
advancement in the field of AI, conversational agents and chatbots can imitate 
human conversation, and support mental health, fostering diversity and 
inclusivity, combating stigma, and countering discrimination. On the other hand, 
if not properly designed, they can harm and perpetuate exclusion and inequities.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the impact of generative conversational AI 
on the queer community.
METHODS: The investigation was designed as a scoping review. Four major 
electronic scholarly databases (Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, and 
PubMed/MEDLINE) and the gray literature (Google Scholar) were consulted from 
inception, without any language restrictions. Original studies focusing on the 
queer community and/or counsellors working with this community exposed to 
chatbots and AI-enhanced virtual platforms and exploring the feasibility, 
acceptance, and/or effectiveness of AI-enhanced tools were deemed eligible. The 
findings were reported in accordance with the "Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews" 
(PRISMA-ScR).
RESULTS: Seven applications (namely, HIVST-Chatbot, TelePrEP Navigator, Amanda 
Selfie, Crisis Contact Simulator, REALbot, Tough Talks, and Queer AI) were 
included and overviewed in the present scoping review. The chatbots and virtual 
assistants identified serve various purposes: namely, i) to identify queer 
individuals at risk for suicide or contracting HIV or other sexually transmitted 
infections; ii) to provide resources to queer youth from underserved areas, iii) 
to facilitate HIV status disclosure to sex partners, and iv) to develop training 
roleplay personas encompassing the diverse experiences and intersecting 
identities of queer youth and educate counselors. The use of generative 
conversational AI for the queer community is still in its early stages. Initial 
studies have found that deploying chatbots is feasible and well-received, with 
high ratings for usability and user satisfaction. However, there is room for 
improvement in terms of the content provided and making conversations more 
engaging and interactive. Many of these studies have used small sample sizes and 
short-term interventions, measuring limited outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, generative conversational AI holds promise, but 
further development and formal evaluation are needed, including studies with 
larger samples, longer interventions, and randomized trials to compare different 
content, delivery methods, and dissemination platforms. Additionally, a focus on 
engagement with behavioral objectives is essential to advance this field. The 
findings have broad practical implications, highlighting that AI's impact spans 
various aspects of people's lives. Assessing AI's impact on diverse communities 
and adopting diversity-aware and intersectional approaches can help shape AI's 
positive impact on society as a whole.

Machines powered by artificial intelligence increasingly permeate social 
networks with control over resources. However, machine allocation behavior might 
offer little benefit to human welfare over networks when it ignores the specific 
network mechanism of social exchange. Here, we perform an online experiment 
involving simple networks of humans (496 participants in 120 networks) playing a 
resource-sharing game to which we sometimes add artificial agents (bots). The 
experiment examines two opposite policies of machine allocation behavior: 
reciprocal bots, which share all resources reciprocally; and stingy bots, which 
share no resources at all. We also manipulate the bot's network position. We 
show that reciprocal bots make little changes in unequal resource distribution 
among people. On the other hand, stingy bots balance structural power and 
improve collective welfare in human groups when placed in a specific network 
position, although they bestow no wealth on people. Our findings highlight the 
need to incorporate the human nature of reciprocity and relational 
interdependence in designing machine behavior in sharing networks. Conscientious 
machines do not always work for human welfare, depending on the network 
structure where they interact.

Rapid drug development requires a high throughput screening technology. NMR 
could benefit from parallel detection but is hampered by technical obstacles. 
Detection sites must be magnetically shimmed to ppb uniformity, which for 
parallel detection is precluded by commercial shimming technology. Here we show 
that, by centering a separate shim system over each detector and employing deep 
learning to cope with overlapping non-orthogonal shimming fields, parallel 
detectors can be rapidly calibrated. Our implementation also reports the 
smallest NMR stripline detectors to date, based on an origami technique, 
facilitating further upscaling in the number of detection sites within the 
magnet bore.

Seoul, 04066, Korea. hayoon@hongik.ac.kr.

In this study, we presented a method for future location prediction based on 
machine learning over geopositioning data sets. There are large amounts of 
geopositioning data sets collected by mobile devices mainly due to modern 
geopositioning systems such as GPS, GLONASS and Galileo. Based on these 
geopositioning data sets, it is possible to have a wide variety of 
location-based services. These data sets can be used for future location 
prediction of objects, especially humans. Additionally, they have a high 
possibility for further applications. The purpose of this research is to present 
a simple and lightweight method that can be applicable to devices with lower 
computing capability devices, such as AIoT (Artificial Intelligence of Things) 
or EdgeML (Edge Machine Learning) devices. We introduced a basic LSTM (Long 
Short Term Memory) model with hyperparameter optimization, especially on window 
size of continuous geopositioning data, using limited previous geopositioning 
data for location prediction purposes. We found that the results of using our 
method for future location prediction are considerably fast and accurate 
compared with existing neural network-model-based approaches. We also applied 
our method to non-continuous geopositioning data sets and found it to be equally 
effective.

Ultrasound imaging is commonly used to aid in fetal development. It has the 
advantage of being real-time, low-cost, non-invasive, and easy to use. However, 
fetal organ detection is a challenging task for obstetricians, it depends on 
several factors, such as the position of the fetus, the habitus of the mother, 
and the imaging technique. In addition, image interpretation must be performed 
by a trained healthcare professional who can take into account all relevant 
clinical factors. Artificial intelligence is playing an increasingly important 
role in medical imaging and can help solve many of the challenges associated 
with fetal organ classification. In this paper, we propose a deep-learning model 
for automating fetal organ classification from ultrasound images. We trained and 
tested the model on a dataset of fetal ultrasound images, including two datasets 
from different regions, and recorded them with different machines to ensure the 
effective detection of fetal organs. We performed a training process on a 
labeled dataset with annotations for fetal organs such as the brain, abdomen, 
femur, and thorax, as well as the maternal cervical part. The model was trained 
to detect these organs from fetal ultrasound images using a deep convolutional 
neural network architecture. Following the training process, the model, 
DenseNet169, was assessed on a separate test dataset. The results were 
promising, with an accuracy of 99.84%, which is an impressive result. The F1 
score was 99.84% and the AUC was 98.95%. Our study showed that the proposed 
model outperformed traditional methods that relied on the manual interpretation 
of ultrasound images by experienced clinicians. In addition, it also 
outperformed other deep learning-based methods that used different network 
architectures and training strategies. This study may contribute to the 
development of more accessible and effective maternal health services around the 
world and improve the health status of mothers and their newborns worldwide.

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform many 
aspects of scholarly publishing. Authors, peer reviewers, and editors might use 
AI in a variety of ways, and those uses might augment their existing work or 
might instead be intended to replace it. We are editors of bioethics and 
humanities journals who have been contemplating the implications of this ongoing 
transformation. We believe that generative AI may pose a threat to the goals 
that animate our work but could also be valuable for achieving those goals. In 
the interests of fostering a wider conversation about how generative AI may be 
used, we have developed a preliminary set of recommendations for its use in 
scholarly publishing. We hope that the recommendations and rationales set out 
here will help the scholarly community navigate toward a deeper understanding of 
the strengths, limits, and challenges of AI for responsible scholarly work.

Interactions with large language models (LLMs) have led to the suggestion that 
these models may soon be conscious. From the perspective of neuroscience, this 
position is difficult to defend. For one, the inputs to LLMs lack the embodied, 
embedded information content characteristic of our sensory contact with the 
world around us. Secondly, the architectures of present-day artificial 
intelligence algorithms are missing key features of the thalamocortical system 
that have been linked to conscious awareness in mammals. Finally, the 
evolutionary and developmental trajectories that led to the emergence of living 
conscious organisms arguably have no parallels in artificial systems as 
envisioned today. The existence of living organisms depends on their actions and 
their survival is intricately linked to multi-level cellular, inter-cellular, 
and organismal processes culminating in agency and consciousness.
