AB  - Intelligence - the ability to learn, reason and solve problems - is at the 
      forefront of behavioural genetic research. Intelligence is highly heritable and 
      predicts important educational, occupational and health outcomes better than any 
      other trait. Recent genome-wide association studies have successfully identified 
      inherited genome sequence differences that account for 20% of the 50% 
      heritability of intelligence. These findings open new avenues for research into 
      the causes and consequences of intelligence using genome-wide polygenic scores 
      that aggregate the effects of thousands of genetic variants.

AB  - Artificial intelligence is advancing rapidly and making its way into all areas of 
      our lives. This review discusses developments and potential practices regarding 
      the use of artificial intelligence in the field of ophthalmology, and the related 
      topic of medical ethics. Various artificial intelligence applications related to 
      the diagnosis of eye diseases were researched in books, journals, search engines, 
      print and social media. Resources were cross-checked to verify the information. 
      Artificial intelligence algorithms, some of which were approved by the US Food 
      and Drug Administration, have been adopted in the field of ophthalmology, 
      especially in diagnostic studies. Studies are being conducted that prove that 
      artificial intelligence algorithms can be used in the field of ophthalmology, 
      especially in diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and 
      retinopathy of prematurity. Some of these algorithms have come to the approval 
      stage. The current point in artificial intelligence studies shows that this 
      technology has advanced considerably and shows promise for future work. It is 
      believed that artificial intelligence applications will be effective in 
      identifying patients with preventable vision loss and directing them to 
      physicians, especially in developing countries where there are fewer trained 
      professionals and physicians are difficult to reach. When we consider the 
      possibility that some future artificial intelligence systems may be candidates 
      for moral/ethical status, certain ethical issues arise. Questions about 
      moral/ethical status are important in some areas of applied ethics. Although it 
      is accepted that current intelligence systems do not have moral/ethical status, 
      it has yet to be determined what the exact the characteristics that confer 
      moral/ethical status are or will be.

AB  - Artificial intelligence in medicine has made dramatic progress in recent years. 
      However, much of this progress is seemingly scattered, lacking a cohesive 
      structure for the discerning observer. In this article, we will provide an 
      up-to-date review of artificial intelligence in medicine, with a specific focus 
      on its application to radiology, pathology, ophthalmology, and dermatology. We 
      will discuss a range of selected papers that illustrate the potential uses of 
      artificial intelligence in a technologically advanced future.

AB  - Artificial intelligence has been advancing in fields including anesthesiology. 
      This scoping review of the intersection of artificial intelligence and anesthesia 
      research identified and summarized six themes of applications of artificial 
      intelligence in anesthesiology: (1) depth of anesthesia monitoring, (2) control 
      of anesthesia, (3) event and risk prediction, (4) ultrasound guidance, (5) pain 
      management, and (6) operating room logistics. Based on papers identified in the 
      review, several topics within artificial intelligence were described and 
      summarized: (1) machine learning (including supervised, unsupervised, and 
      reinforcement learning), (2) techniques in artificial intelligence (e.g., 
      classical machine learning, neural networks and deep learning, Bayesian methods), 
      and (3) major applied fields in artificial intelligence.The implications of 
      artificial intelligence for the practicing anesthesiologist are discussed as are 
      its limitations and the role of clinicians in further developing artificial 
      intelligence for use in clinical care. Artificial intelligence has the potential 
      to impact the practice of anesthesiology in aspects ranging from perioperative 
      support to critical care delivery to outpatient pain management.

LID - 10.47391/JPMA.1779 [doi]
AB  - The medical profession deals with 'humanism' which involves interactions with 
      people, the ability to think about them, care for them, and to provide positive 
      reinforcement in clinical follow-ups. Emotional intelligence integrates the 
      significant features of personal relationships to promote self-management skills, 
      like adaptability, control of temperaments and reduction of tension, which can 
      improve performance of individuals. This has led to increasing interest in the 
      importance of emotional intelligence for effective academic growth, professional 
      experiences and clinical practice. There are many studies examining the 
      correlation between emotional intelligence and academic achievement at different 
      education levels, signifying its importance to predict students who need guided 
      intervention. With proven relationship between emotional intelligence and 
      academic success, the assessment of emotional intelligence can be introduced in 
      entrance exams of medical schools to recognise students who might need directed 
      intermediation. With the agreement of all stakeholders, emotional intelligence 
      training workshops and awareness sessions can be introduced for educators and 
      students.

AB  - Artificial intelligence is playing an increasingly important role in many fields 
      of medicine, assisting physicians in most steps of patient management. In 
      nephrology, artificial intelligence can already be used to improve clinical care, 
      hemodialysis prescriptions, and follow-up of transplant recipients. However, many 
      nephrologists are still unfamiliar with the basic principles of medical 
      artificial intelligence. This review seeks to provide an overview of medical 
      artificial intelligence relevant to the practicing nephrologist, in all fields of 
      nephrology. We define the core concepts of artificial intelligence and machine 
      learning and cover the basics of the functioning of neural networks and deep 
      learning. We also discuss the most recent clinical applications of artificial 
      intelligence in nephrology and medicine; as an example, we describe how 
      artificial intelligence can predict the occurrence of progressive immunoglobulin 
      A nephropathy. Finally, we consider the future of artificial intelligence in 
      clinical nephrology and its impact on medical practice, and conclude with a 
      discussion of the ethical issues that the use of artificial intelligence raises 
      in terms of clinical decision making, physician-patient relationship, patient 
      privacy, and data collection.

AB  - Changes from the fourth edition of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children 
      (WISC) to the fifth edition are discussed, with particular emphasis on how the 
      electronic administration facilitated assessment. The hierarchical organization 
      and conceptualization of primary indices have been adjusted, based on recent 
      theory and research on the construct of intelligence. Changes also include 
      updates to psychometric properties and consideration of cultural bias. The 
      scoring program allows intelligence scores to be linked statistically to 
      achievement measures to aid in diagnoses of learning disabilities. Electronic 
      assessment was clunky at times but overall delivered on its promise of quicker 
      and more accurate administration and scoring.

      Dentistry is no exception to this trend, and the applications of artificial 
      intelligence are particularly promising in the field of oral and maxillofacial 
      (OMF) radiology. Recent researches on artificial intelligence in OMF radiology 
      have mainly used convolutional neural networks, which can perform image 
      classification, detection, segmentation, registration, generation, and 
      refinement. Artificial intelligence systems in this field have been developed for 
      the purposes of radiographic diagnosis, image analysis, forensic dentistry, and 
      image quality improvement. Tremendous amounts of data are needed to achieve good 
      results, and involvement of OMF radiologist is essential for making accurate and 
      consistent data sets, which is a time-consuming task. In order to widely use 
      artificial intelligence in actual clinical practice in the future, there are lots 
      of problems to be solved, such as building up a huge amount of fine-labeled open 
      data set, understanding of the judgment criteria of artificial intelligence, and 
      DICOM hacking threats using artificial intelligence. If solutions to these 
      problems are presented with the development of artificial intelligence, 
      artificial intelligence will develop further in the future and is expected to 
      play an important role in the development of automatic diagnosis systems, the 
      establishment of treatment plans, and the fabrication of treatment tools. OMF 
      radiologists, as professionals who thoroughly understand the characteristics of 
      radiographic images, will play a very important role in the development of 
      artificial intelligence applications in this field.

TI  - The impact of emotional intelligence in health care professionals on caring 
      behaviour towards patients in clinical and long-term care settings: Findings from 
      an integrative review.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Over recent years there has been criticism within the United 
      Kingdom's health service regarding a lack of care and compassion, resulting in 
      adverse outcomes for patients. The impact of emotional intelligence in staff on 
      patient health care outcomes has been recently highlighted. Many recruiters now 
      assess emotional intelligence as part of their selection process for health care 
      staff. However, it has been argued that the importance of emotional intelligence 
      in health care has been overestimated. OBJECTIVES: To explore relationships 
      between emotional intelligence in health care professionals, and caring 
      behaviour. To further explore any additional factors related to emotional 
      intelligence that may impact upon caring behaviour. DESIGN: An integrative review 
      design was used. DATA SOURCES: Psychinfo, Medline, CINAHL Plus, Social Sciences 
      Citation Index, Science Citation Index, and Scopus were searched for studies from 
      1995 to April 2017. REVIEW METHODS: Studies providing quantitative or qualitative 
      exploration of how any healthcare professionals' emotional intelligence is linked 
      to caring in healthcare settings were selected. RESULTS: Twenty two studies 
      fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Three main types of health care professional 
      were identified: nurses, nurse leaders, and physicians. Results indicated that 
      the emotional intelligence of nurses was related to both physical and emotional 
      caring, but emotional intelligence may be less relevant for nurse leaders and 
      physicians. Age, experience, burnout, and job satisfaction may also be relevant 
      factors for both caring and emotional intelligence. CONCLUSIONS: This review 
      provides evidence that developing emotional intelligence in nurses may positively 
      impact upon certain caring behaviours, and that there may be differences within 
      groups that warrant further investigation. Understanding more about which aspects 
      of emotional intelligence are most relevant for intervention is important, and 
      directions for further large scale research have been identified.

TI  - Mandevillian intelligence.
PG  - 4169-4200
LID - 10.1007/s11229-017-1414-z [doi]
AB  - Mandevillian intelligence is a specific form of collective intelligence in which 
      individual cognitive vices (i.e., shortcomings, limitations, constraints and 
      biases) are seen to play a positive functional role in yielding collective forms 
      of cognitive success. The present paper introduces the concept of mandevillian 
      intelligence and reviews a number of strands of empirical research that help to 
      shed light on the phenomenon. The paper also attempts to highlight the value of 
      the concept of mandevillian intelligence from a philosophical, scientific and 
      engineering perspective. Inasmuch as we accept the notion of mandevillian 
      intelligence, then it seems that the cognitive and epistemic value of a specific 
      social or technological intervention will vary according to whether our attention 
      is focused at the individual or collective level of analysis. This has a number 
      of important implications for how we think about the design and evaluation of 
      collective cognitive systems. For example, the notion of mandevillian 
      intelligence forces us to take seriously the idea that the exploitation (or even 
      the accentuation) of individual cognitive shortcomings could, in some situations, 
      provide a productive route to collective forms of cognitive and epistemic 
      success.
