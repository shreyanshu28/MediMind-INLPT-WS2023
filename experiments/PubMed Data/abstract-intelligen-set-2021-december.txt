Emotional intelligence (EI) is defined by the ability to perceive, manage, and 
reason about emotions in oneself and others. Studies have reported deficits in 
EI abilities among certain antisocial populations such as individuals with 
psychopathy, and enhanced performance among sexual offenders. Despite EI's 
relevance to offending behaviour, the association between EI and paraphilic 
offending has been under-studied. We examined the association between EI, sexual 
offending, and sexual sadism in 80 incarcerated men with sexual offenses and 207 
incarcerated men with non-sexual offences. EI was assessed using the 
Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT). Sadism was measured 
using the Severe Sexual Sadism Scale (SeSaS). Results showed that SeSaS scores 
were positively associated with Strategic EI (the ability to understand and 
manage emotions), but were not significantly related to Experiential EI. This 
may reflect core characteristics of sexual sadism including domination and 
manipulation, challenging the prevalent notion that higher EI is invariably 
positive.

COVID-19 epidemic has swiftly disrupted our day-to-day lives affecting the 
international trade and movements. Wearing a face mask to protect one's face has 
become the new normal. In the near future, many public service providers will 
expect the clients to wear masks appropriately to partake of their services. 
Therefore, face mask detection has become a critical duty to aid worldwide 
civilization. This paper provides a simple way to achieve this objective 
utilising some fundamental Machine Learning tools as TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV 
and Scikit-Learn. The suggested technique successfully recognises the face in 
the image or video and then determines whether or not it has a mask on it. As a 
surveillance job performer, it can also recognise a face together with a mask in 
motion as well as in a video. The technique attains excellent accuracy. We 
investigate optimal parameter values for the Convolutional Neural Network model 
(CNN) in order to identify the existence of masks accurately without generating 
over-fitting.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic manifested the need of 
developing robust digital platforms for facilitating healthcare services such as 
consultancy, clinical therapies, real time remote monitoring, early diagnosis 
and future predictions. Innovations made using technologies such as Internet of 
Things (IoT), edge computing, cloud computing and artificial intelligence are 
helping address this crisis. The urge for remote monitoring, symptom analysis 
and early detection of diseases lead to tremendous increase in the deployment of 
wearable sensor devices. They facilitate seamless gathering of physiological 
data such as electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, respiration traces (RESP), 
galvanic skin response (GSR), pulse rate, body temperature, photoplethysmograms 
(PPG), oxygen saturation (SpO2) etc. For diagnosis and analysis purpose, the 
gathered data needs to be stored. Wearable devices operate on batteries and have 
a memory constraint. In mHealth application architectures, this gathered data is 
hence stored on cloud based servers. While transmitting data from wearable 
devices to cloud servers via edge devices, a lot of energy is consumed. This 
paper proposes a deep learning based compression model SCAElite that reduces the 
data volume, enabling energy efficient transmission.
RESULTS: Stress Recognition in Automobile Drivers dataset and MIT-BIH dataset 
from PhysioNet are used for validation of algorithm performance. The model 
achieves a compression ratio of up to 300 fold with reconstruction errors within 
8% over the stress recognition dataset and 106.34-fold with reconstruction 
errors within 8% over the MIT-BIH dataset. The computational complexity of 
SCAElite is 51.65% less compared to state-of-the-art deep compressive model.
CONCLUSION: It is experimentally validated that SCAElite guarantees a high 
compression ratio with good quality restoration capabilities for physiological 
signal compression in mHealth applications. It has a compact architecture and is 
computationally more efficient compared to state-of-the-art deep compressive 
model.

BACKGROUND: Current wearable devices enable the detection of atrial fibrillation 
(AF), but a machine learning (ML)-based approach may facilitate accurate 
prediction of AF onset.
OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed to develop, optimize, and validate an 
ML-based model for real-time prediction of AF onset in a population at high risk 
of incident AF.
METHODS: A primary ML-based prediction model of AF onset (M1) was developed on 
the basis of the Huawei Heart Study, a general-population AF screening study 
using photoplethysmography (PPG)-based smart devices. After optimization in 554 
individuals with 469,267 PPG data sets, the optimized ML-based model (M2) was 
further prospectively validated in 50 individuals with paroxysmal AF at high 
risk of AF onset, and compared with 72-hour Holter electrocardiographic (ECG) 
monitoring, a criterion standard, from September 1, 2019, to November 5, 2019.
RESULTS: Among 50 patients with paroxysmal AF (mean age 67 ± 12 years, 40% 
women), there were 2,808 AF events from a total of 14,847,356 ECGs over 72 hours 
and 6,860 PPGs (45.83 ± 13.9 per subject per day). The best performance of M1 
for AF onset prediction was achieved 4 hours before AF onset (area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve: 0.94; 95% confidence interval: 
0.93-0.94). M2 sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative 
predictive value, and accuracy (at 0 to 4 hours before AF onset) were 81.9%, 
96.6%, 96.4%, 83.1%, and 88.9%, respectively, compared with 72-hour Holter ECG.
CONCLUSIONS: The PPG- based ML model demonstrated good ability for AF prediction 
in advance. (Mobile Health [mHealth] technology for improved screening, patient 
involvement and optimizing integrated care in atrial 
fibrillation; ChiCTR-OOC-17014138).

Sleep studies are imperative to recapitulate phenotypes associated with sleep 
loss and uncover mechanisms contributing to psychopathology. Most often, 
investigators manually classify the polysomnography into vigilance states, which 
is time-consuming, requires extensive training, and is prone to inter-scorer 
variability. While many works have successfully developed automated vigilance 
state classifiers based on multiple EEG channels, we aim to produce an automated 
and openaccess classifier that can reliably predict vigilance state based on a 
single cortical electroencephalogram (EEG) from rodents to minimize the 
disadvantages that accompany tethering small animals via wires to computer 
programs. Approximately 427 hours of continuously monitored EEG, electromyogram 
(EMG), and activity were labeled by a domain expert out of 571 hours of total 
data. Here we evaluate the performance of various machine learning techniques on 
classifying 10-second epochs into one of three discrete classes: paradoxical, 
slow-wave, or wake. Our investigations include Decision Trees, Random Forests, 
Naive Bayes Classifiers, Logistic Regression Classifiers, and Artificial Neural 
Networks. These methodologies have achieved accuracies ranging from 
approximately 74% to approximately 96%. Most notably, the Random Forest and the 
ANN achieved remarkable accuracies of 95.78% and 93.31%, respectively. Here we 
have shown the potential of various machine learning classifiers to 
automatically, accurately, and reliably classify vigilance states based on a 
single EEG reading and a single EMG reading.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to identify factors associated with diabetes 
management self-efficacy in pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus 
(GDM) in Korea.
METHODS: A total of 173 pregnant women with GDM in Korea were recruited by 
posting announcements at two Korean online communities focusing on pregnancy and 
GDM. Participants completed a structured online survey from July to September 
2018. Thirteen inappropriate responses were excluded and a total of 160 
questionnaires were used in the final analysis. Descriptive statistics were 
calculated and multiple regression with the enter method was done to identify 
the associations of depressive mood, anxiety, emotional intelligence, and sleep 
quality with diabetes management self-efficacy.
RESULTS: Respondents reported a moderately depressive mood (mean, 10.36), low to 
moderate anxiety (mean, 41.65), above-average emotional intelligence (mean, 
78.04), moderate sleep quality (mean, 42.01), and above-average diabetes 
management self-efficacy (mean, 52.29). The major factor associated with 
diabetes management self-efficacy of pregnant women with GDM was emotional 
intelligence (β=.51, p<.001). Other factors, in descending order of influence, 
were sleep quality (β=.22, p<.001) and exercise (β=.18, p=.004). Taken together, 
the aforementioned factors explained 34.6% (F=39.53, p<.001) of the total 
variance.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that to improve the diabetes 
management self-efficacy of pregnant women with GDM, it is necessary to develop 
an education program that can also enhance emotional intelligence, sleep 
quality, and exercise.

HIV/AIDS is an ongoing global pandemic, with an estimated 39 million infected 
worldwide. Early detection is anticipated to help improve outcomes and prevent 
further infections. Point-of-care diagnostics make HIV/AIDS diagnoses available 
both earlier and to a broader population. Wide-spread and automated HIV risk 
estimation can offer objective guidance. This supports providers in making an 
informed decision when considering patients with high HIV risk for HIV testing 
or pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). We propose a novel machine learning method 
that allows providers to use the data from a patient's previous stays at the 
clinic to estimate their HIV risk. All features available in the clinical data 
are considered, making the set of features objective and independent of expert 
opinions. The proposed method builds on association rules that are derived from 
the data. The incidence rate ratio (IRR) is determined for each rule. Given a 
new patient, the mean IRR of all applicable rules is used to estimate their HIV 
risk. The method was tested and validated on the publicly available clinical 
database MIMIC-IV, which consists of around 525,000 hospital stays that included 
a stay at the intensive care unit or emergency department. We evaluated the 
method using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). 
The best performance with an AUC of 0.88 was achieved with a model consisting of 
53 rules. A threshold value of 0.66 leads to a sensitivity of 98% and a 
specificity of 53%. The rules were grouped into drug abuse, psychological 
illnesses (e.g., PTSD), previously known associations (e.g., pulmonary 
diseases), and new associations (e.g., certain diagnostic procedures). In 
conclusion, we propose a novel HIV risk estimation method that builds on 
existing clinical data. It incorporates a wide range of features, leading to a 
model that is independent of expert opinions. It supports providers in making 
informed decisions in the point-of-care diagnostics process by estimating a 
patient's HIV risk.

Radiation Dose Reduction in Digital Mammography by Deep-Learning Algorithm Image 
Reconstruction: A Preliminary Study.

Ha SM, Kim HH, Kang E, Seo BK, Choi N, Kim TH, Ku YJ, Ye JC.

PURPOSE: To develop a denoising convolutional neural network-based image 
processing technique and investigate its efficacy in diagnosing breast cancer 
using low-dose mammography imaging.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 6 breast radiologists were included in this 
prospective study. All radiologists independently evaluated low-dose images for 
lesion detection and rated them for diagnostic quality using a qualitative 
scale. After application of the denoising network, the same radiologists 
evaluated lesion detectability and image quality. For clinical application, a 
consensus on lesion type and localization on preoperative mammographic 
examinations of breast cancer patients was reached after discussion. Thereafter, 
coded low-dose, reconstructed full-dose, and full-dose images were presented and 
assessed in a random order.
RESULTS: Lesions on 40% reconstructed full-dose images were better perceived 
when compared with low-dose images of mastectomy specimens as a reference. In 
clinical application, as compared to 40% reconstructed images, higher values 
were given on full-dose images for resolution (p < 0.001); diagnostic quality 
for calcifications (p < 0.001); and for masses, asymmetry, or architectural 
distortion (p = 0.037). The 40% reconstructed images showed comparable values to 
100% full-dose images for overall quality (p = 0.547), lesion visibility (p = 
0.120), and contrast (p = 0.083), without significant differences.
CONCLUSION: Effective denoising and image reconstruction processing techniques 
can enable breast cancer diagnosis with substantial radiation dose reduction.

영상을 무작위 순서로 제시하여 평가하였다.
결과: 전 절제 표본의 저선량 영상을 참조로 40% 재구성된 영상에서 병변이 더 잘 인식되었다. 임상 적용단계에서 40% 재구성된 영상과 
비교하여, 기존 선량 영상이 해상도(p < 0.001), 석회에 대한 진단 품질(p < 0.001), 유방 종괴, 비대칭, 구조왜곡의 진단 
품질(p = 0.037)에 대해 더 높은 평균값을 보였다. 40% 재구성된 영상은 100% 영상과 비교 시 전반적 화질(p = 0.547), 
병변의 가시성(p = 0.120), 대조도(p = 0.083)에서 비슷한 성적을 보였으며 유의미한 차이도 보이지 않았다.
결론: 깊은 컨볼루션 신경망 기법을 결합한 효과적인 잡음 제거 및 영상 재구성 처리 알고리즘은 유방 촬영의 상당한 선량 감소를 위한 길을 열어 
유방암 진단을 가능하게 할 것이다.

In working memory training studies, individual trajectories are known to vary 
considerably between participants. A better understanding of how individual 
differences affect training outcomes is important because it might inform the 
development of more effective training interventions. This study explored how 
measures of working memory, intelligence, sustained attention, training 
motivation, mindset, psychological well-being, perceived stress, and sleep 
quality affect initial training performance and rate of change. A total of 217 
upper secondary students completed 12 weeks of adaptive dual-n-back in a 
classroom setting. We analyzed their self-reported training data using latent 
growth curve modeling. We found that working memory and intelligence predicted 
both, initial training performance and rate of performance change. Sustained 
attention and sleep quality predicted initial performance, but not the rate of 
change. Furthermore, we observed that participants who completed the 
intervention scored significantly higher on measures of working memory and 
intelligence and reported lower levels of perceived stress and higher levels of 
sleep quality at baseline compared to dropouts. In general, our study supports 
the magnification account with higher ability individuals starting out at a 
higher performance level and showing a higher rate of performance change, and 
moreover, being more likely to adhere to the training protocol.

This study extends our knowledge about the management of older employees in the 
sector of financial services, which faces enormous transformational pressures 
(e.g., emergence of artificial intelligence, digital services). Based on the 
black box model of human resource management, we investigate how executives at 
16 major financial institutions manage their total rewards to motivate their 
older professionals to stay at work longer. Top management's views towards older 
professionals underlie a firm's culture or climate, and more precisely, the 
extent of the perception that they are a strategic resource that needs focused 
management. Across firms, such adaptation (or lack thereof) is made through the 
following total rewards components: (1) flexibility in working time and place of 
work, (2) hiring of retirees, (3) hiring or promotion of older professionals, 
(4) role adjustment, (5) responsibilities and performance standards, (6) 
monetary rewards, benefits, and (7) recognition, succession planning, and 
support for retirement planning or preparation. The black box model should be 
used in future research to understand which reward components work best in which 
contextsto motivate older workers to stay at work longer.

Saudi Arabia plays an important strategic role within the Middle East and afar 
because of its geographical location, and being the host of one of the largest 
annual religious mass gatherings in the world "The Hajj". During the recent 
coronavirus pandemic, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) developed a 
multisectoral plan that adopted multiple measures to limit the spread of 
Covid-19 transmission both domestically and internationally. In this article, we 
review all public health related policy decisions from the Saudi Ministry of 
Health, other government departments, and the private sector that contributed to 
limiting the severe consequences from Covid-19. Ten effective strategies are 
outlined and the challenges related to their implementation are explored. The 
strategies include: 1. Quarantine and travel restriction, 2. Expansion of 
serological screening, 3. Mask wearing (covering the face and nose) and social 
distancing, 4. Preparation of hospitals to deal with the influx of coronavirus 
cases, 5. Use of artificial intelligence, 6.Public assurance, 7.Removal of slum 
areas and re housing of its inhabitants, 8. Cancellation of the Hajj season, 9. 
Economic stimulus packages to safeguard the economy, and 10. fair and priority 
driven vaccine distribution. Conclusion: The government of Saudi Arabia 
demonstrated responsibility at the highest level to prioritize the safety and 
well-being of its citizens and residents. Rapid early response to the pandemic 
warnings, extensive experience in previous epidemics and in mass gathering 
medicine, wise management of healthcare resources, and unprecedented 
harmonization of governmental and private sectors were significant factors for 
this success.

Medical imaging provides a comprehensive perspective and rich information for 
disease diagnosis. Combined with artificial intelligence technology, medical 
imaging can be further mined for detailed pathological information. Many studies 
have shown that the macroscopic imaging characteristics of tumors are closely 
related to microscopic gene, protein and molecular changes. In order to explore 
the function of artificial intelligence algorithms in in-depth analysis of 
medical imaging information, this paper reviews the articles published in recent 
years from three perspectives: medical imaging analysis method, clinical 
applications and the development of medical imaging in the direction of 
pathological molecular prediction. We believe that AI-aided medical imaging 
analysis will be extensively contributing to precise and efficient clinical 
decision.

Body surface potential mapping (BSPM) is a noninvasive modality to assess 
cardiac bioelectric activity with a rich history of practical applications for 
both research and clinical investigation. BSPM provides comprehensive 
acquisition of bioelectric signals across the entire thorax, allowing for more 
complex and extensive analysis than the standard electrocardiogram (ECG). 
Despite its advantages, BSPM is not a common clinical tool. BSPM does, however, 
serve as a valuable research tool and as an input for other modes of analysis 
such as electrocardiographic imaging and, more recently, machine learning and 
artificial intelligence. In this report, we examine contemporary uses of BSPM, 
and provide an assessment of its future prospects in both clinical and research 
environments. We assess the state of the art of BSPM implementations and explore 
modern applications of advanced modeling and statistical analysis of BSPM data. 
We predict that BSPM will continue to be a valuable research tool, and will find 
clinical utility at the intersection of computational modeling approaches and 
artificial intelligence.

Associative memories in the brain receive and store patterns of activity 
registered by the sensory neurons, and are able to retrieve them when necessary. 
Due to their importance in human intelligence, computational models of 
associative memories have been developed for several decades now. In this paper, 
we present a novel neural model for realizing associative memories, which is 
based on a hierarchical generative network that receives external stimuli via 
sensory neurons. It is trained using predictive coding, an error-based learning 
algorithm inspired by information processing in the cortex. To test the model's 
capabilities, we perform multiple retrieval experiments from both corrupted and 
incomplete data points. In an extensive comparison, we show that this new model 
outperforms in retrieval accuracy and robustness popular associative memory 
models, such as autoencoders trained via backpropagation, and modern Hopfield 
networks. In particular, in completing partial data points, our model achieves 
remarkable results on natural image datasets, such as ImageNet, with a 
surprisingly high accuracy, even when only a tiny fraction of pixels of the 
original images is presented. Our model provides a plausible framework to study 
learning and retrieval of memories in the brain, as it closely mimics the 
behavior of the hippocampus as a memory index and generative model.

BACKGROUND: Multivariate prognostic analysis has been traditionally performed by 
regression models. However, many algorithms capable of translating an infinity 
of patterns into probabilities have emerged. The comparative accuracy of 
artificial intelligence and traditional statistical models has not been 
established in the medical field.
OBJECTIVE: To test the artificial intelligence as an accurate algorithm for 
predicting coronary disease in the scenario of acute chest pain and evaluate 
whether its performance is superior to traditional statistical model.
METHODS: A consecutive sample of 962 patients admitted with chest pain was 
analyzed. Two probabilistic models of coronary disease were built using the 
first two-thirds of patients: a machine learning algorithm and a traditional 
logistic model. The performance of these two predictive strategies were 
evaluated in the remaining third of patients. The final logistic regression 
model had significant variables only, at the 5% significance level.
RESULTS: The training sample had an average age of 59 ± 15 years, 58% males, and 
a 52% prevalence of coronary disease. The logistic model was composed of nine 
independent predictors. The machine learning algorithm was composed of all 
candidates for predictors. In the test sample, the area under the ROC curve for 
prediction of coronary disease was 0.81 (95% CI = 0.77 - 0.86) for the machine 
learning algorithm, similar to that obtained in logistic model (0.82; 95% CI = 
0.77 - 0.87), p = 0.68.
CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that an accurate machine learning 
prediction tool did not prove to be superior to the statistical model of 
logistic regression.

foi construído somente com variáveis significativas a um nível de significância 
de 5%.
RESULTADOS: A amostra de treinamento tinha idade média de 59 ± 15 anos, 58% do 
sexo masculino, e uma prevalência de doença coronariana de 52%. O modelo 
logístico foi composto de nove preditores independentes. O algoritmo machine 
learning foi composto por todos os candidatos a preditores. Na amostra teste, a 
área sob a curva ROC para predição de doença coronariana foi de 0,81 (IC95% = 
0,77 – 0,86) para o algoritmo machine learning, similar à obtida no modelo 
logístico (0,82; IC95% = 0,77 – 0,87), p = 0,68.
CONCLUSÃO: O presente estudo sugere que um modelo machine learning acurado não 
garante superioridade à um modelo estatístico tradicional.

Nanotechnology keeps drawing attention due to the great tunable properties of 
nanomaterials in comparison to their bulk conventional materials. The growth of 
nanotechnology in combination with the digitization era has led to an increased 
need of safety related data. In addition to safety, new data-driven paradigms on 
safe and sustainable by design materials are stressing the necessity of data 
even more. Data is a fundamental asset to the scientific community in studying 
and analysing the entire life-cycle of nanomaterials. Unfortunately, data exist 
in a scattered fashion, in different sources and formats. To our knowledge, 
there is no study focusing on aspects of actual data-structure knowledge that 
exists in literature and databases. The purpose of this review research is to 
transparently and comprehensively, display to the nanoscience community the 
datasets readily available for machine learning purposes making it convenient 
and more efficient for the next users such as modellers or data curators to 
retrieve information. We systematically recorded the features and descriptors 
available in the datasets and provide synopsised information on their ranges, 
forms and metrics in the supplementary material.

innovations using mobile technology: A systematic literature review.

University, Kuala Lumpur, KL, Malaysia.

The banking and financial sectors have witnessed a significant development 
recently due to financial technology (FinTech), and it has become an essential 
part of the financial system. Many factors helped the development of this 
sector, including the pandemics such as Covid-19, the considerable increasing 
market value of the FinTech sector worldwide, and new technologies such as 
blockchain, artificial intelligence, big data, cloud computing and mobile 
technology. Moreover, changes in consumer's preferences, especially the 
Z-generation (digital generation). FinTech shifted the traditional business 
models to mobile platforms characterized by ease of access and swift 
transactions. Mobile technology became the main backbone for FinTech innovations 
and acts as a channel to deliver FinTech services that overcome all geographical 
and timing barriers, thus enhancing financial inclusion. Mobile perceived Trust 
(MPT), or the trust in using financial business models via mobile technology, is 
a crucial factor in the FinTech context that has mediation effects on the 
intention and adoption of different FinTech business models. Unfortunately, few 
studies have explored MPT mediations on consumers' intention to adopt FinTech 
innovations using mobile technology. Typically, many studies examined trust/MPT 
as an independent and unidirectional variable and investigated its effects on 
behaviour intention without predicting its mediation effects. This study aimed 
to develop a systematic literature review on MPT mediation in FinTech, focusing 
on the period from 2016 and 2021, in journals ranked Q1 and Q2, and known-based 
theories such as the technology acceptance model, the unified theory of 
acceptance and use of technology, and the mobile technology acceptance model. 
This study found that only four articles were published in Q1 and Q2 journals. 
In these articles, the MPT was used as a mediator, and its effects were measured 
on the intention and adoption of the behaviour.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of the research was to determine the reliability, factor 
structure, as well as validity of the Mentalization Scale (MentS) - a 
self-report measure of mentalization.
METHODS: Two groups of subjects were examined. The first group (N = 202) 
consisted of students from Poznan universities; the other group (N = 229) 
consisted of individuals employed in various positions, with different education 
levels. The following measures were used: Mentalization Questionnaire, the 
Borderline Personality Inventory, the Experiences in Close Relationships 
Scale-Revised, the short version of the International Personality Item Pool NEO 
Personality Inventory, short version of Empathy Quotient and the Trait Emotional 
Intelligence Questionnaire.
RESULTS: Reliability analysis showed high internal consistency of all three 
MentS subscales, and the factor analysis supports the three-factor structure of 
the questionnaire. Mentalization as measured by MentS was positively linked with 
mentalization-related constructs: empathy and emotional intelligence. Obtained 
relations between mentalization and attachment dimensions, borderline features 
and personality traits as well as observed gender differences also support the 
validity of the MentS.
CONCLUSIONS: The verification of the hypotheses formulated in the present study 
has led to the conclusion that the Polish version of the Mentalization Scale 
(MentS) - a new measure of mentalization - has high psychometric value and may 
be used for brief yet multifaceted measurement of mentalization.

Psychopathic traits and empathy: moral decision making and complex affect 
expression recognition.

[Article in English, Polish]

Author information:

OBJECTIVES: The issue of specific cognitive deficits in psychopathy is still 
open for debate. Much evidencepoints to problems with affective empathy. The 
current study aims to verify the hypothesis about the correlation between 
psychopathic traits, difficulties in complex affect expression recognition and 
making moral decisions without taking into account the aspect of potential harm.
METHODS: 58 males were studied (student and inmate groups). Psychopathy was 
assessed with the Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R). Recognition of complex 
emotional expressions was assessed with the Faces subset of the Emotional 
Intelligence Scale and moral inclinations to avoid harm ("deontological") and 
maximize consequences ("utilitarian") were measured via the process dissociation 
method.
RESULTS: Inmates generally showed deficiencies in correct expression 
recognition, for both positive and negative stimuli. Inmates with high 
psychopathy additionally showed high rate of false positive perceptions of 
negative emotions. High psychopathy inmates showed lower, than low psychopathy 
inmates and students, inclination to avoid harm. High psychopathy was related to 
declarations that the presented moral dilemmas were "easy decisions". Group 
differences in the inclination to maximize consequences in moral decisions were 
not significant.
CONCLUSIONS: Results support the hypothesis that psychopathy is related to 
ageneral deficiency in affective processing. Psychopathic traitsare related to 
worse recognition of complex emotional expressions which does not manifest 
itself as uncertainty, but as high rate of false positives. Inmates with 
psychopathic traits also declare that the presented moral sacrificial dilemmas 
require "easy decisions" and show reduced responsivity to harm. An important and 
problematic element of psychopathy seems to be the dysfunctional affective 
empathy with a simultaneous unawareness of these dysfunctions.

Studies have shown that dwarf plants have the potential for use in obtaining 
hybrids. The aim of this study was to evaluate the agronomic potential and 
genetic dissimilarity of saladette type dwarf tomato plant populations through 
the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs). The following traits were 
analyzed: mean fruit weight, transverse and longitudinal fruit diameter, fruit 
shape, pulp thickness, locule number, internode length, soluble solids content, 
and β-carotene, lycopene, and leaf zingiberene contents. A dendrogram obtained 
by the unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) and Kohonen 
self-organizing maps (SOM) agreed in the distinction of the BC1F3 populations 
from the dwarf donor parent. SOM was more consistent in identifying the genetic 
similarities among the BC1F3 dwarf tomato plant populations and allowed for the 
determination of weights of each variable in the cluster formation. The UFU SDi 
13-1 BC1F3 population was revealed to be a promising option for obtaining 
saladette type dwarf tomato plant lines.

PURPOSE: The aim was to develop a novel artificial intelligence (AI)-guided 
clinical decision support system, to predict radiation doses to subsites of the 
mandible using diagnostic computed tomography scans acquired before any planning 
of head and neck radiation therapy (RT).
METHODS AND MATERIALS: A dose classifier was trained using RT plans from 86 
patients with oropharyngeal cancer; the test set consisted of an additional 20 
plans. The classifier was trained to predict whether mandible subsites would 
receive a mean dose >50 Gy. The AI predictions were prospectively evaluated and 
compared with those of a specialist head and neck radiation oncologist for 9 
patients. Positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), 
Pearson correlation coefficient, and Lin concordance correlation coefficient 
were calculated to compare the AI predictions to those of the physician.
RESULTS: In the test data set, the AI predictions had a PPV of 0.95 and NPV of 
0.88. For 9 patients evaluated prospectively, there was a strong correlation 
between the predictions of the AI algorithm and physician (P = .72, P < .001). 
Comparing the AI algorithm versus the physician, the PPVs were 0.82 versus 0.25, 
and the NPVs were 0.94 versus 1.0, respectively. Concordance between physician 
estimates and final planned doses was 0.62; this was 0.71 between AI-based 
estimates and final planned doses.
CONCLUSION: AI-guided decision support increased precision and accuracy of 
pre-RT dental dose estimates.

Innovation refers to the introduction of a product, a process, a service or a 
solution resulting in something new or significantly improved compared to the 
already available alternatives. In the clinical context, it is strictly related 
to the identification of a new added value in terms of quality, therapeutic 
efficacy and safety. Over the years several innovative approaches have been 
introduced in the clinical practice, revolutionizing the treatment and the 
management of important rhinologic conditions. Innovative tools, including new 
drugs, biomaterials, and mobile applications seem to be able to improve the 
clinical outcomes and the quality of life of many patients affected by (often 
relapsing) rhinologic diseases. Among the main modern pharmacological 
innovations, mention must be made of the biological drugs like monoclonal 
antibodies (mAbs). Recently, new mAbs have been introduced and investigated as 
useful arms in the treatment of some inflammatory/infectious or oncological 
diseases affecting the nasal cavities and paranasal sinuses. The already 
approved or still investigated mAbs work inhibiting different type 2 
inflammation pathways, including those mediated by IgE (omalizumab), IL-4/IL-13 
(dupilumab), and IL-5 (mepolizumab). Moreover, considering the higher expression 
of PD-L1 in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, the use of PD-1 inhibitors, such as 
nivolumab, or a dual CTLA-4/PD-1 blockade (ipilimumab plus nivolumab) appear to 
be an effective strategy for the treatment of this cancer form. The implants 
with bio-absorbable biomaterials represent new interesting available 
technological innovations. Moreover, advanced technologies such as the 
artificial intelligence, the machine learning as well as the augmented or 
virtual reality have also proved useful in rhinologic field with main impacts on 
precision medicine and surgery. Finally, the development and use of 
mobile-Health tools represent a winning strategy in monitoring of the therapy 
success, safety and tolerability as well as the progress of chronic disease 
including chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. Supporting the research of 
innovative tools and strategies (including pharmacological, technologic, or 
digital ones) is essential to improve the management of chronic diseases that 
significantly affect the patients' quality of life.

Objective: This study aimed to investigate the cause of primary infertility in a 
rare case with unilateral absence of vas deferens. Case report : A 35-year-old 
man was presented to the Infertility Clinic at the National Center of Maternal 
and Child Health (NCMCH) with an eight-year history of primary infertility. 
Clinical examination showed a normal intelligence with a coarse facial 
appearance and small testicles. Hormonal tests detected elevated levels of 
prolactin (PRL), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone 
(LH), and low levels of testosterone. Chromosomal analysis with fluorescence in 
situ hybridization (FISH) revealed a 46XX with SRY (sex-determining region Y) 
positive karyotype with translocation of the SRY gene (46XX 
der(X)t(X:Y)(p11.1:p11.3)(SRY+)). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed 
bilateral seminal vesicles atrophy and agenesis of the vas deferens on the right 
side, which is rarely found in 46, XX male syndrome. Conclusion: Although 46XX 
testicular disorder of sexual development (DSD) cases are rare, multiple aspects 
of the clinical examinations are important to make an accurate diagnosis and to 
provide proper genetic counseling and guidance to patients in their long-term 
management.

BACKGROUND: Depression is more than just sentiment sad or passing a rough patch. 
It is a serious psychological wellbeing disorder that needs curative care and 
maintenance. Emotional Intelligence (EI) is a comprehensive personality 
construct denoting the capability to perceive and control affects within the 
self. Alexithymia is another personality construct that refers to the difficulty 
of recognizing and expressing feelings, with an outside oriented thinking style. 
Suicidal ideation is defined as thinking of appealing in conduct intentional to 
end one's life.
AIM: The current study aimed to examine the relationship between emotional 
intelligence, alexithymia and suicidal ideation among depressive patients.
DESIGN: A descriptive correlation design was utilized.
SETTING: This study was conducted at the Psychiatric Outpatient Clinic in El 
Ahrar Hospital, Alsharkia Governorate, Egypt.
SUBJECTS: A purposeful sample of 65 depressed patients was recruited for this 
study.
TOOLS: Data were collected by using four tools: Socio-demographic Data Sheet, 
Emotional Intelligence Scales, Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) and Suicidal 
Ideation Scale.
RESULTS: The majority of depressed patients were having alexithymia and having 
low emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence was statistically 
significantly negatively correlated with alexithymia and suicidal ideation. 
Nevertheless, alexithymia was statistically significantly positively correlated 
with suicidal ideation. It was statistically significantly positively predictor 
of suicidal ideation and alexithymia, while it was statistically significantly 
negatively predictor of suicidal ideation and emotional intelligence.
CONCLUSION: Lower emotional intelligence led to higher suicidal ideation in 
depressive patients. Increasing alexithymia in patients with depressive 
disorders caused an increase in their suicidal ideation. Therefore, it is 
recommended implementing a training program such as mindfulness and emotional 
intelligence skills for patients to enhance their emotional intelligence.

Update: Osteoarthritis and Spondylosis, Active Component, U.S. Armed Forces, 
2016-2020.

Williams V, Ying S, Stahlman S.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common adult joint disease and accounts for 
significant morbidity burdens among U.S. civilian and military populations. 
During 2016-2020, the crude overall rates of incident OA and spondylosis 
diagnoses among U.S. active component service members were 630.9 per 100,000 
person-years (p-yrs) and 958.2 per 100,000 p-yrs, respectively. Crude annual 
rates of both conditions decreased markedly from 2016 through 2020 with declines 
evident in all of the demographic and military subgroups examined. Compared to 
their respective counterparts, crude overall rates of OA diagnoses were highest 
among male service members, those aged 35 or older, non-Hispanic Black service 
members, Army members, and those working in health care occupations. Crude 
overall rates of spondylosis diagnoses were highest among those aged 30 or 
older, non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic Black service members, Army members, 
and those in health care and communications/intelligence occupations. More than 
two-thirds of all incident OA diagnoses involved the knee (38.8%) or shoulder 
(28.4%). Differences in anatomic site-specific rates of OA were apparent by sex, 
race/ethnicity group, service, and military occupation. Additional research to 
identify military-specific equipment and activities that increase the risk of 
acute and chronic damage to joints would be useful to develop, test, and 
implement practical and effective countermeasures against OA and spondylosis 
among military members in general and those in high-risk occupations 
specifically.

When Medical Devices Have a Mind of Their Own: The Challenges of Regulating 
Artificial Intelligence.

Boubker J.

How can an agency like the U.S. Food & Drug Administration ("FDA") effectively 
regulate software that is constantly learning and adapting to real-world data? 
Continuously learning algorithms pose significant public health risks if a 
medical device can change overtime to fundamentally alter the nature of a device 
post-market. This Article evaluates the FDA's proposed regulatory framework for 
artificially intelligent medical devices against the backdrop of the current 
technology, as well as industry professionals' desired trajectory, to determine 
whether the proposed regulatory framework can ensure safe and reliable medical 
devices without stifling innovation. Ultimately, the FDA succeeds in placing 
effective limits on continuously learning algorithms while giving manufacturers 
freedom to allow their devices to adapt to real-world data. The framework, 
however, does not give adequate attention to protecting patient data, monitoring 
cybersecurity, and ensuring safety and efficacy. The FDA, medical device 
industry, and relevant policymakers should increase oversight of these areas to 
protect patients and providers relying on this new technology.

Applying a Common Enterprise Theory of Liability to Clinical AI Systems.

Chan B.

The advent of artificial intelligence ("AI") holds great potential to improve 
clinical diagnostics. At the same time, there are important questions of 
liability for harms arising from the use of this technology. Due to their 
complexity, opacity, and lack of foreseeability, AI systems are not easily 
accommodated by traditional liability frameworks. This difficulty is compounded 
in the health care space where various actors, namely physicians and health care 
organizations, are subject to distinct but interrelated legal duties regarding 
the use of health technology. Without a principled way to apportion 
responsibility among these actors, patients may find it difficult to recover for 
injuries. In this Article, I propose that physicians, manufacturers of clinical 
AI systems, and hospitals be considered a common enterprise for the purposes of 
liability. This proposed framework helps facilitate the apportioning of 
responsibility among disparate actors under a single legal theory. Such an 
approach responds to concerns about the responsibility gap engendered by 
clinical AI technology as it shifts away from individualistic notions of 
responsibility, embodied by negligence and products liability, toward a more 
distributed conception. In addition to favoring plaintiff recovery, a common 
enterprise strict liability approach would create strong incentives for the 
relevant actors to take care.

Similarity of computations across domains does not imply shared implementation: 
The case of language comprehension.

Fedorenko E(1), Shain C(1).

Research, MIT.

Understanding language requires applying cognitive operations (e.g., memory 
retrieval, prediction, structure building)-relevant across many cognitive 
domains-to specialized knowledge structures (a particular language's phonology, 
lexicon, and syntax). Are these computations carried out by domain-general 
circuits or by circuits that store domain-specific representations? Recent work 
has characterized the roles in language comprehension of the language-selective 
network and the multiple demand (MD) network, which has been implicated in 
executive functions and linked to fluid intelligence, making it a prime 
candidate for implementing computations that support information processing 
across domains. The language network responds robustly to diverse aspects of 
comprehension, but the MD network shows no sensitivity to linguistic variables. 
We therefore argue that the MD network does not play a core role in language 
comprehension, and that past claims to the contrary are likely due to 
methodological artifacts. Although future studies may discover some aspects of 
language that require the MD network, evidence to date suggests that those will 
not be related to core linguistic processes like lexical access or composition. 
The finding that the circuits that store linguistic knowledge carry out 
computations on those representations aligns with general arguments against the 
separation between memory and computation in the mind and brain.

Natural products (NPs) are primarily recognized as privileged structures to 
interact with protein drug targets. Their unique characteristics and structural 
diversity continue to marvel scientists for developing NP-inspired medicines, 
even though the pharmaceutical industry has largely given up. High-performance 
computer hardware, extensive storage, accessible software and affordable online 
education have democratized the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in many 
sectors and research areas. The last decades have introduced natural language 
processing and machine learning algorithms, two subfields of AI, to tackle NP 
drug discovery challenges and open up opportunities. In this article, we review 
and discuss the rational applications of AI approaches developed to assist in 
discovering bioactive NPs and capturing the molecular "patterns" of these 
privileged structures for combinatorial design or target selectivity.

The paper presents a new security aspect for a Mobile Ad-Hoc Network 
(MANET)-based IoT model using the concept of artificial intelligence. The Black 
Hole Attack (BHA) is considered one of the most affecting threats in the MANET 
in which the attacker node drops the entire data traffic and hence degrades the 
network performance. Therefore, it necessitates the designing of an algorithm 
that can protect the network from the BHA node. This article introduces Ad-hoc 
On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV), a new updated routing protocol that combines 
the advantages of the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), Artificial Neural Network 
(ANN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) techniques. The combination of the SVM 
with ANN is the novelty of the proposed model that helps to identify the 
attackers within the discovered route using the AODV routing mechanism. Here, 
the model is trained using ANN but the selection of training data is performed 
using the ABC fitness function followed by SVM. The role of ABC is to provide a 
better route for data transmission between the source and the destination node. 
The optimized route, suggested by ABC, is then passed to the SVM model along 
with the node's properties. Based on those properties ANN decides whether the 
node is a normal or an attacker node. The simulation analysis performed in 
MATLAB shows that the proposed work exhibits an improvement in terms of Packet 
Delivery Ratio (PDR), throughput, and delay. To validate the system efficiency, 
a comparative analysis is performed against the existing approaches such as 
Decision Tree and Random Forest that indicate that the utilization of the SVM 
with ANN is a beneficial step regarding the detection of BHA attackers in the 
MANET-based IoT networks.

Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) 
technology have brought on substantial strides in predicting and identifying 
health emergencies, disease populations, and disease state and immune response, 
amongst a few. Although, skepticism remains regarding the practical application 
and interpretation of results from ML-based approaches in healthcare settings, 
the inclusion of these approaches is increasing at a rapid pace. Here we provide 
a brief overview of machine learning-based approaches and learning algorithms 
including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning along with 
examples. Second, we discuss the application of ML in several healthcare fields, 
including radiology, genetics, electronic health records, and neuroimaging. We 
also briefly discuss the risks and challenges of ML application to healthcare 
such as system privacy and ethical concerns and provide suggestions for future 
applications.

BACKGROUND: Accurate, rapid quantification of ventricular scar using cardiac 
magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) carries importance in arrhythmia management and 
patient prognosis. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been applied to other 
radiological challenges with success.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess AI methodologies used for left ventricular scar 
identification in CMR, imaging sequences used for training, and its diagnostic 
evaluation.
METHODS: Following PRISMA recommendations, a systematic search of PubMed, 
Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL, OpenDissertations, arXiv, and IEEE Xplore was 
undertaken to June 2021 for full-text publications assessing left ventricular 
scar identification algorithms. No pre-registration was undertaken. 
Random-effect meta-analysis was performed to assess Dice Coefficient (DSC) 
overlap of learning vs predefined thresholding methods.
RESULTS: Thirty-five articles were included for final review. Supervised and 
unsupervised learning models had similar DSC compared to predefined threshold 
models (0.616 vs 0.633, P = .14) but had higher sensitivity, specificity, and 
accuracy. Meta-analysis of 4 studies revealed standardized mean difference of 
1.11; 95% confidence interval -0.16 to 2.38, P = .09, I2 = 98% favoring learning 
methods.
CONCLUSION: Feasibility of applying AI to the task of scar detection in CMR has 
been demonstrated, but model evaluation remains heterogenous. Progression toward 
clinical application requires detailed, transparent, standardized model 
comparison and increased model generalizability.

BACKGROUND: Patients with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) are at 
a high risk of malignant ventricular arrhythmias. The use of remote ICD 
monitoring, wearable devices, and patient-reported outcomes generate large 
volumes of potential valuable data. Artificial intelligence-based methods can be 
used to develop personalized prediction models and improve early-warning 
systems.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to develop an integrated web-based 
personalized prediction engine for ICD therapy.
METHODS: This international, multicenter, prospective, observational study 
consists of 2 phases: (1) a development study and (2) a feasibility study. We 
plan to enroll 400 participants with an ICD (with or without cardiac 
resynchronization therapy) on remote monitoring: 300 participants in the 
development study and 100 in the feasibility study. During 12-month follow-up, 
electronic health record data, remote monitoring data, accelerometry-assessed 
physical behavior data, and patient-reported data are collected. By using 
machine- and deep-learning approaches, a prediction engine is developed to 
assess the risk probability of ICD therapy (shock and antitachycardia pacing). 
The feasibility of the prediction engine as a clinical tool, the SafeHeart 
Platform, is assessed during the feasibility study.
RESULTS: Development study recruitment commenced in 2021. The feasibility study 
starts in 2022.
CONCLUSION: SafeHeart is the first study to prospectively collect a multimodal 
data set to construct a personalized prediction engine for ICD therapy. 
Moreover, SafeHeart explores the integration and added value of detailed 
objective accelerometer data in the prediction of clinical events. The 
translation of the SafeHeart Platform to clinical practice is examined during 
the feasibility study.

With the development of three-dimensional (3D) simulation software, preoperative 
simulation technology is almost completely established. The remaining issue is 
how to recognize anatomy three-dimensionally. Extended reality is a newly 
developed technology with several merits for surgical application: no 
requirement for a sterilized display monitor, better spatial awareness, and the 
ability to share 3D images among all surgeons. Various technology or devices for 
intraoperative navigation have also been developed to support the safety and 
certainty of liver surgery. Consensus recommendations regarding indocyanine 
green fluorescence were determined in 2021. Extended reality has also been 
applied to intraoperative navigation, and artificial intelligence (AI) is one of 
the topics of real-time navigation. AI might overcome the problem of liver 
deformity with automatic registration. Including the issues described above, 
this article focuses on recent advances in simulation and navigation in liver 
surgery from 2020 to 2021.

In 2021, the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Japan, undertook 
enhanced event-based surveillance (EBS) for infectious diseases occurring 
overseas that have potential for importation (excluding coronavirus disease 2019 
[COVID-19]) for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Summer Games (the Games). 
The pre-existing EBS system was enhanced using the World Health Organization 
Epidemic Intelligence from Open Sources system and the BlueDot Epidemic 
Intelligence platform. The enhanced EBS before and during the Games did not 
detect any major public health event that would warrant action for the Games. 
However, information from multiple sources helped us identify events, 
characterize risk and improve confidence in risk assessment. The collaboration 
also reduced the surveillance workload of the host country, while ensuring the 
quality of surveillance, even during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Temporal lobe epilepsy is associated with MRI findings reflecting underlying 
mesial temporal sclerosis. Identifying these MRI features is critical for the 
diagnosis and management of temporal lobe epilepsy. To date, this process relies 
on visual assessment by highly trained human experts (e.g. neuroradiologists, 
epileptologists). Artificial intelligence is increasingly recognized as a 
promising aid in the radiological evaluation of neurological diseases, yet its 
applications in temporal lobe epilepsy have been limited. Here, we applied a 
convolutional neural network to assess the classification accuracy of temporal 
lobe epilepsy based on structural MRI. We demonstrate that convoluted neural 
networks can achieve high accuracy in the identification of unilateral temporal 
lobe epilepsy cases even when the MRI had been originally interpreted as normal 
by experts. We show that accuracy can be potentiated by employing smoothed grey 
matter maps and a direct acyclic graphs approach. We further discuss the 
foundations for the development of computer-aided tools to assist with the 
diagnosis of epilepsy.

Oocyte/embryo selection methodologies are either invasive or noninvasive and can 
be applied at various stages of development from the oocyte to cleaved embryos 
and up to the blastocyst stage. Morphology and the proportion of embryos 
developing to the blastocyst stage are important criteria to assess 
developmental competence. Evaluation of morphology remains the method of choice 
for selecting viable oocytes for IVP or embryos prior to transfer. Although 
non-invasive approaches are improving, invasive ones have been extremely helpful 
in finding candidate genes to determine oocyte/embryo quality. There is still a 
strong need for further refinement of existing oocyte and embryo selection 
methods and quality parameters. The development of novel, robust and 
non-invasive procedures will ensure that only embryos with the highest 
developmental potential are chosen for transfer. In the present review, various 
methods for assessing the quality of oocytes and preimplantation embryos, 
particularly in cattle, are considered. These methods include assessment of 
morphology including different staining procedures, transcriptomic and proteomic 
analyses, metabolic profiling, as well as the use of artificial intelligence 
technologies.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to systematically review recent health economic 
evaluations (HEEs) of artificial intelligence (AI) applications in healthcare. 
The aim was to discuss pertinent methods, reporting quality and challenges for 
future implementation of AI in healthcare, and additionally advise future HEEs.
METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted in 2 databases (PubMed and 
Scopus) for articles published in the last 5 years. Two reviewers performed 
independent screening, full-text inclusion, data extraction, and appraisal. The 
Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards and Philips 
checklist were used for the quality assessment of included studies.
RESULTS: A total of 884 unique studies were identified; 20 were included for 
full-text review, covering a wide range of medical specialties and care pathway 
phases. The most commonly evaluated type of AI was automated medical image 
analysis models (n = 9, 45%). The prevailing health economic analysis was cost 
minimization (n = 8, 40%) with the costs saved per case as preferred outcome 
measure. A total of 9 studies (45%) reported model-based HEEs, 4 of which 
applied a time horizon >1 year. The evidence supporting the chosen analytical 
methods, assessment of uncertainty, and model structures was underreported. The 
reporting quality of the articles was moderate as on average studies reported on 
66% of Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards items.
CONCLUSIONS: HEEs of AI in healthcare are limited and often focus on costs 
rather than health impact. Surprisingly, model-based long-term evaluations are 
just as uncommon as model-based short-term evaluations. Consequently, insight 
into the actual benefits offered by AI is lagging behind current technological 
developments.

The coronavirus of 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a global pandemic by World 
Health Organization in March 2020. Effective testing is crucial to slow the 
spread of the pandemic. Artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques 
can help COVID-19 detection using various clinical symptom data. While deep 
learning (DL) approach requiring centralized data is susceptible to a high risk 
of data privacy breaches, federated learning (FL) approach resting on 
decentralized data can preserve data privacy, a critical factor in the health 
domain. This paper reviews recent advances in applying DL and FL techniques for 
COVID-19 detection with a focus on the latter. A model FL implementation use 
case in health systems with a COVID-19 detection using chest X-ray image data 
sets is studied. We have also reviewed applications of previously published FL 
experiments for COVID-19 research to demonstrate the applicability of FL in 
tackling health research issues. Last, several challenges in FL implementation 
in the healthcare domain are discussed in terms of potential future work.

Hospital System".

I introduce here what we have been and are doing in the Cross-ministerial 
Strategic Innovation Promotion Program (SIP) "Innovative AI Hospital System" 
project supported by the Japanese government. This SIP program began in April 
2018 as 1 of 12 SIP projects that aim to establish "Society 5.0" in various 
scientific areas. This AI hospital program is the only one related to the health 
and medical care field, in which we are attempting to construct a big medical 
database, to implement many artificial intelligence (AI) tools in hospital 
systems, and to make the medical care system more effective along with reduction 
of workload of medical workers. To maintain or improve the quality of the health 
and medical care system, it is indispensable to share various updated and useful 
information among healthcare workers as well as the general population. We have 
been challenging to establish the digitalized medical care system in various 
aspects. I describe here where we are and the future perspective of the AI-based 
digital medicine.

Broadband high-spatial-resolution high-spectral-resolution flexible imaging 
spectrometer design study.

Yang Q.

A broadband high-spatial-resolution high-spectral-resolution flexible imaging 
spectrometer (B-2HSR-FIS) is presented, which includes two microlens arrays 
(MLAs), multiple fiber bundles, a scanning Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI), a 
reflection grating, a cylindrical lens, and an area-array detector. The first 
MLA is arranged in a circular arc to obtain a field angle between 8° and 60° in 
the horizontal plane. The second MLA is arranged in a straight line. Each fiber 
bundle containing seven optical fibers is coupled to a separate microlens of the 
first MLA, subdividing the field angle of each microlens into seven smaller 
field angles to improve spatial resolution. The combination of a scanning FPI 
and a reflection grating enables the B-2HSR-FIS to obtain both high spectral 
resolution and broadband spectral range in the ultraviolet to near-infrared 
spectral region. Compared with all existing imaging spectrometers, the 
B-2HSR-FIS is the first to simultaneously obtain high spatial resolution, high 
spectral resolution, broadband spectral range, and moderate field angle, to the 
best of our knowledge. The B-2HSR-FIS has great potential for vision 
intelligence (e.g., as an eye of a robot).

Development of a new dug is a very lengthy and highly expensive process since 
only preclinical, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and toxicological studies 
include a multiple of in silico, in vitro, in vivo experimentations that 
traditionally last several years. In the present review, we briefly report some 
examples that demonstrate the power of the computer-assisted drug discovery 
process with some examples that are published and revealing the successful 
applications of artificial intelligence (AI) technology on this vivid area. 
Besides, we address the situation of drug repositioning (repurposing) in 
clinical applications. Yet few success stories in this regard that provide us 
with a clear evidence that AI will reveal its great potential in accelerating 
effective new drug finding. AI accelerates drug repurposing and AI approaches 
are altogether necessary and inevitable tools in new medicine development. In 
spite of the fact that AI in drug development is still in its infancy, the 
advancements in AI and machine-learning (ML) algorithms have an unprecedented 
potential. The AI/ML solutions driven by pharmaceutical scientists, computer 
scientists, statisticians, physicians and others are increasingly working 
together in the processes of drug development and are adopting AI-based 
technologies for the rapid discovery of medicines. AI approaches, coupled with 
big data, are expected to substantially improve the effectiveness of drug 
repurposing and finding new drugs for various complex human diseases.

Digital pathology is being transformed by artificial intelligence (AI)-based 
pathological diagnosis. One major challenge for correct AI diagnoses is to 
ensure the focus quality of captured images. Here, we propose a deep 
learning-based single-shot autofocus method for microscopy. We use a modified 
MobileNetV3, a lightweight network, to predict the defocus distance with a 
single-shot microscopy image acquired at an arbitrary image plane without 
secondary camera or additional optics. The defocus prediction takes only 9 ms 
with a focusing error of only ∼1/15 depth of field. We also provide 
implementation examples for the augmented reality microscope and the whole slide 
imaging (WSI) system. Our proposed technique can perform real-time and accurate 
autofocus which will not only support pathologists in their daily work, but also 
provide potential applications in the life sciences, material research, and 
industrial automatic detection.

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is an urgent public health concern, and it is prudent 
to prevent DR than face the burden of blindness arising from it. This requires 
committed physicians, ophthalmologists, patients as well as policy makers. 
Blindness rate due to DR has shown a decline in developed countries which is not 
only due to advanced and accessible tertiary care, but also large-scale 
screening programmes. Currently, the most common method of screening in low- and 
middle-income countries is still an opportunistic model. A more practical, 
cost-effective and systematic screening model is needed, utilizing advances in 
telemedicine and artificial intelligence.

The medical profession deals with 'humanism' which involves interactions with 
people, the ability to think about them, care for them, and to provide positive 
reinforcement in clinical follow-ups. Emotional intelligence integrates the 
significant features of personal relationships to promote self-management 
skills, like adaptability, control of temperaments and reduction of tension, 
which can improve performance of individuals. This has led to increasing 
interest in the importance of emotional intelligence for effective academic 
growth, professional experiences and clinical practice. There are many studies 
examining the correlation between emotional intelligence and academic 
achievement at different education levels, signifying its importance to predict 
students who need guided intervention. With proven relationship between 
emotional intelligence and academic success, the assessment of emotional 
intelligence can be introduced in entrance exams of medical schools to recognise 
students who might need directed intermediation. With the agreement of all 
stakeholders, emotional intelligence training workshops and awareness sessions 
can be introduced for educators and students.

Mosaicism in fragile X syndrome (FXS) refers to two different FMR1 allele 
variations: size mosaicism represents different numbers of CGG repeats between 
the two alleles, such that in addition to a full mutation allele there is an 
allele in the normal or premutation range of CGG repeats, while methylation 
mosaicism indicates whether a full-mutation allele is fully or partially 
methylated. The present study explored the association between mosaicism type 
and cognitive and behavioral functioning in a large sample of males 3 years and 
older (n = 487) with FXS, participating in the Fragile X Online Registry with 
Accessible Research Database. Participants with methylation mosaicism were less 
severely cognitively affected as indicated by a less severe intellectual 
disability rating, higher intelligence quotient and adaptive behavior score, and 
lower social impairment score. In contrast, the presence of size mosaicism was 
not significantly associated with better cognitive and behavioral outcomes than 
full mutation. Our findings suggest that methylation mosaicism is associated 
with better cognitive functioning and adaptive behavior and less social 
impairment. Further research could assess to what extent these cognitive and 
behavioral differences depend on molecular diagnostic methods and the impact of 
mosaicism on prognosis of individuals with FXS.

Spam is any form of annoying and unsought digital communication sent in bulk and 
may contain offensive content feasting viruses and cyber-attacks. The voluminous 
increase in spam has necessitated developing more reliable and vigorous 
artificial intelligence-based anti-spam filters. Besides text, an email 
sometimes contains multimedia content such as audio, video, and images. However, 
text-centric email spam filtering employing text classification techniques 
remains today's preferred choice. In this paper, we show that text 
pre-processing techniques nullify the detection of malicious contents in an 
obscure communication framework. We use Spamassassin corpus with and without 
text pre-processing and examined it using machine learning (ML) and deep 
learning (DL) algorithms to classify these as ham or spam emails. The proposed 
DL-based approach consistently outperforms ML models. In the first stage, using 
pre-processing techniques, the long-short-term memory (LSTM) model achieves the 
highest results of 93.46% precision, 96.81% recall, and 95% F1-score. In the 
second stage, without using pre-processing techniques, LSTM achieves the best 
results of 95.26% precision, 97.18% recall, and 96% F1-score. Results show the 
supremacy of DL algorithms over the standard ones in filtering spam. However, 
the effects are unsatisfactory for detecting encrypted communication for both 
forms of ML algorithms.

Network operation and maintenance (O & M) activities of data centers focus 
mainly on checking the operating states of devices. O & M engineers determine 
how services are running and the bearing capacity of a data center by checking 
the operating states of devices. However, this method cannot reflect the real 
transmission status of business data; therefore, engineers cannot fully 
comprehensively perceive the overall running conditions of businesses. In this 
paper, ERSPAN (Encapsulated Remote Switch Port Analyzer) technology is applied 
to deliver stream matching rules in the forwarding path of TCP packets and 
mirror the TCP packets into the network O & M AI collector, which is used to 
conduct an in-depth analysis on the TCP packets, collect traffic statistics, 
recapture the forwarding path, carry out delayed computing, and identify 
applications. This enables O & M engineers to comprehensively perceive the 
service bearing status in a data center, and form a tightly coupled correlation 
model between networks and services through end-to-end visualized modeling, 
providing comprehensive technical support for data center optimization and early 
warning of network risks.

As technology advances rapidly and vast amounts of data are collected, 
artificial intelligence (AI) is increasing its presence in our lives. Medicine 
is a major focus point of AI developers. There are examples of algorithms on par 
with medical professionals, the most prominent case being skin cancer 
recognition. However, advancement involves the necessity to adapt to technology 
and to patients utilizing it on a daily basis. What is more, patients present 
growing trust towards machine-aided health care. Dermatology is a potent field 
for AI use as visual data are easy to collect, hold a lot of information and are 
paramount for diagnosis.

OBJECTIVE: Computer-aided diagnosis using deep learning algorithms has been 
initially applied in the field of mammography, but there is no large-scale 
clinical application.
METHODS: This study proposed to develop and verify an artificial intelligence 
model based on mammography. Firstly, mammograms retrospectively collected from 
six centers were randomized to a training dataset and a validation dataset for 
establishing the model. Secondly, the model was tested by comparing 12 
radiologists' performance with and without it. Finally, prospectively enrolled 
women with mammograms from six centers were diagnosed by radiologists with the 
model. The detection and diagnostic capabilities were evaluated using the 
free-response receiver operating characteristic (FROC) curve and ROC curve.
RESULTS: The sensitivity of model for detecting lesions after matching was 0.908 
for false positive rate of 0.25 in unilateral images. The area under ROC curve 
(AUC) to distinguish the benign lesions from malignant lesions was 0.855 [95% 
confidence interval (95% CI): 0.830, 0.880]. The performance of 12 radiologists 
with the model was higher than that of radiologists alone (AUC: 0.852 vs. 0.805, 
P=0.005). The mean reading time of with the model was shorter than that of 
reading alone (80.18 s vs. 62.28 s, P=0.032). In prospective application, the 
sensitivity of detection reached 0.887 at false positive rate of 0.25; the AUC 
of radiologists with the model was 0.983 (95% CI: 0.978, 0.988), with 
sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative 
predictive value (NPV) of 94.36%, 98.07%, 87.76%, and 99.09%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The artificial intelligence model exhibits high accuracy for 
detecting and diagnosing breast lesions, improves diagnostic accuracy and saves 
time.

OBJECTIVES: Pouch of Douglas (POD) obliteration is a severe consequence of 
inflammation in the pelvis, often seen in patients with endometriosis. The 
sliding sign is a dynamic transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) test that can diagnose 
POD obliteration. We aimed to develop a deep learning (DL) model to 
automatically classify the state of the POD using recorded videos depicting the 
sliding sign test.
METHODS: Two expert sonologists performed, interpreted, and recorded videos of 
consecutive patients from September 2018 to April 2020. The sliding sign was 
classified as positive (i.e. normal) or negative (i.e. abnormal; POD 
obliteration). A DL model based on a temporal residual network was prospectively 
trained with a dataset of TVS videos. The model was tested on an independent 
test set and its diagnostic accuracy including area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and 
negative predictive value (PPV/NPV) was compared to the reference standard 
sonologist classification (positive or negative sliding sign).
RESULTS: In a dataset consisting of 749 videos, a positive sliding sign was 
depicted in 646 (86.2%) videos, whereas 103 (13.8%) videos depicted a negative 
sliding sign. The dataset was split into training (414 videos), validation 
(139), and testing (196) maintaining similar positive/negative proportions. When 
applied to the test dataset using a threshold of 0.9, the model achieved: AUC 
96.5% (95% CI: 90.8-100.0%), an accuracy of 88.8% (95% CI: 83.5-92.8%), 
sensitivity of 88.6% (95% CI: 83.0-92.9%), specificity of 90.0% (95% CI: 
68.3-98.8%), a PPV of 98.7% (95% CI: 95.4-99.7%), and an NPV of 47.7% (95% CI: 
36.8-58.2%).
CONCLUSIONS: We have developed an accurate DL model for the prediction of the 
TVS-based sliding sign classification.
LAY SUMMARY: Endometriosis is a disease that affects females. It can cause very 
severe scarring inside the body, especially in the pelvis - called the pouch of 
Douglas (POD). An ultrasound test called the 'sliding sign' can diagnose POD 
scarring. In our study, we provided input to a computer on how to interpret the 
sliding sign and determine whether there was POD scarring or not. This is a type 
of artificial intelligence called deep learning (DL). For this purpose, two 
expert ultrasound specialists recorded 749 videos of the sliding sign. Most of 
them (646) were normal and 103 showed POD scarring. In order for the computer to 
interpret, both normal and abnormal videos were required. After providing the 
necessary inputs to the computer, the DL model was very accurate (almost nine 
out of every ten videos was correctly determined by the DL model). In 
conclusion, we have developed an artificial intelligence that can interpret 
ultrasound videos of the sliding sign that show POD scarring that is almost as 
accurate as the ultrasound specialists. We believe this could help increase the 
knowledge on POD scarring in people with endometriosis.

High-resolution manometry (HRM) is the primary procedure used to diagnose 
esophageal motility disorders. Its manual interpretation and classification, 
including evaluation of swallow-level outcomes and then derivation of a 
study-level diagnosis based on Chicago Classification (CC), may be limited by 
inter-rater variability and inaccuracy of an individual interpreter. We 
hypothesized that an automatic diagnosis platform using machine learning and 
artificial intelligence approaches could be developed to accurately identify 
esophageal motility diagnoses. Further, a multi-stage modeling framework, akin 
to the step-wise approach of the CC, was utilized to leverage advantages of a 
combination of machine learning approaches including deep-learning models and 
feature-based models. Models were trained and tested using a dataset comprised 
of 1741 patients' HRM studies with CC diagnoses assigned by expert physician 
raters. In the swallow-level stage, three models based on convolutional neural 
networks (CNNs) were developed to predict swallow type and swallow 
pressurization (test accuracies of 0.88 and 0.93, respectively), and integrated 
relaxation pressure (IRP)(regression model with test error of 4.49 mmHg). At the 
study-level stage, model selection from families of the expert-knowledge-based 
rule models, xgboost models and artificial neural network(ANN) models were 
conducted. A simple model-agnostic strategy of model balancing motivated by 
Bayesian principles was utilized, which gave rise to model averaging weighted by 
precision scores. The averaged (blended) models and individual models were 
compared and evaluated, of which the best performance on test dataset is 0.81 in 
top-1 prediction, 0.92 in top-2 predictions. This is the first 
artificial-intelligence style model to automatically predict esophageal motility 
(CC) diagnoses from HRM studies using raw multi-swallow data and it achieved 
high accuracy. Thus, this proposed modeling framework could be broadly applied 
to assist with HRM interpretation in a clinical setting.

Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is an essential part of the world's 
traditional medicine. However, there are still many issues in the promotion and 
development of TCM, such as a lot of unique TCM treatments are taught only 
between the master and an apprentice in practice, it takes dozens of years for a 
TCM practitioner to master them and the complicated TCM treatment principles. 
Intelligent TCM models, as a promising method, can overcome these issues. The 
performance of previously proposed AI models for intelligent TCM is restricted 
since they rely on clinical medical records, which are limited, hard to collect, 
and unavailable for intelligent TCM researchers. In this work, we propose a 
two-stage transfer learning model to generate TCM prescriptions from a few 
medical records and TCM documentary resources, called TCMBERT for short. First, 
the TCMBERT is trained on TCM books. Then, it is fine-tuned on a limited number 
of medical records to generate TCM prescriptions. The experimental results show 
that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in all 
comparison baselines on the TCM prescription generation task. The TCMBERT and 
the training process can be used in TCM tasks and other medical tasks for 
dealing with textual resources.

BACKGROUND: Research on technologies based on artificial intelligence in 
healthcare has increased during the last decade, with applications showing great 
potential in assisting and improving care. However, introducing these 
technologies into nursing can raise concerns related to data bias in the context 
of training algorithms and potential implications for certain populations. 
Little evidence exists in the extant literature regarding the efficacious 
application of many artificial intelligence -based health technologies used in 
healthcare.
OBJECTIVES: To synthesize currently available state-of the-art research in 
artificial intelligence -based technologies applied in nursing practice.
DESIGN: Scoping review METHODS: PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science and IEEE Xplore 
were searched for relevant articles with queries that combine names and terms 
related to nursing, artificial intelligence and machine learning methods. 
Included studies focused on developing or validating artificial intelligence 
-based technologies with a clear description of their impacts on nursing. We 
excluded non-experimental studies and research targeted at robotics, nursing 
management and technologies used in nursing research and education.
RESULTS: A total of 7610 articles published between January 2010 and March 2021 
were revealed, with 93 articles included in this review. Most studies explored 
the technology development (n = 55, 59.1%) and formation (testing) (n = 28, 
30.1%) phases, followed by implementation (n = 9, 9.7%) and operational (n = 1, 
1.1%) phases. The vast majority (73.1%) of studies provided evidence with a 
descriptive design (level VI) while only a small portion (4.3%) were randomised 
controlled trials (level II). The study aims, settings and methods were poorly 
described in the articles, and discussion of ethical considerations were lacking 
in 36.6% of studies. Additionally, one-third of papers (33.3%) were reported 
without the involvement of nurses.
CONCLUSIONS: Contemporary research on applications of artificial intelligence 
-based technologies in nursing mainly cover the earlier stages of technology 
development, leaving scarce evidence of the impact of these technologies and 
implementation aspects into practice. The content of research reported is 
varied. Therefore, guidelines on research reporting and implementing artificial 
intelligence -based technologies in nursing are needed. Furthermore, integrating 
basic knowledge of artificial intelligence -related technologies and their 
applications in nursing education is imperative, and interventions to increase 
the inclusion of nurses throughout the technology research and development 
process is needed.

BACKGROUND: By combining up-to-date medical knowledge and steadily increasing 
patient data, a new level of medical care can emerge.
SUMMARY AND KEY MESSAGES: Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) are an 
arising solution to handling rich data and providing them to health care 
providers in order to improve diagnosis and treatment. However, despite 
promising examples in many areas, substantial evidence for a thorough benefit of 
these support solutions is lacking. This may be due to a lack of general 
frameworks and diverse health systems around the globe. We therefore summarize 
the current status of CDSSs in medicine but also discuss potential limitations 
that need to be overcome in order to further foster future development and 
acceptance.

BACKGROUND: Digital pathology, in its primary meaning, describes the utilization 
of computer screens to view scanned histology slides. Digitized tissue sections 
can be easily shared for a second opinion. In addition, it allows tissue image 
analysis using specialized software to identify and measure events previously 
observed by a human observer. These tissue-based readouts were highly 
reproducible and precise. Digital pathology has developed over the years through 
new technologies. Currently, the most discussed development is the application 
of artificial intelligence to automatically analyze tissue images. However, even 
new label-free imaging technologies are being developed to allow imaging of 
tissues by means of their molecular composition.
SUMMARY: This review provides a summary of the current state-of-the-art and 
future digital pathologies. Developments in the last few years have been 
presented and discussed. In particular, the review provides an outlook on 
interesting new technologies (e.g., infrared imaging), which would allow for 
deeper understanding and analysis of tissue thin sections beyond conventional 
histopathology.
KEY MESSAGES: In digital pathology, mathematical methods are used to analyze 
images and draw conclusions about diseases and their progression. New innovative 
methods and techniques (e.g., label-free infrared imaging) will bring 
significant changes in the field in the coming years.

BACKGROUND: Digital technology has become an integral part of healthcare and 
will revolutionize the practice of medicine. Although previously the 
administrative tasks were captured by digital technologies, now the 
communication channels with the patients are also being focused. For example, 
taking medical histories is now made possible by this new technology, 
information and explanatory forms can be sent digitally, and even face-to-face 
consultations are increasingly made possible by video consultations. Especially 
in the COVID pandemic, this form of contactless encounter has become a valuable 
enrichment of medical care. But also telemedical tasks such as teleconsultation 
or artificial intelligence in the context of adenoma detection are techniques 
that are conquering outpatient and inpatient visceral medical care.
SUMMARY: This article gives an overview of digital communication and possible 
uses of digital technologies in medical practices in Germany.
KEY MESSAGE: Medicine is renewing itself through digital techniques. The pace of 
change is rapid and unstoppable. Today's medical progress is no longer 
conceivable without these techniques.

(1)Interventional and Experimental Endoscopy (InExEn), Department of Internal 
Medicine II, Gastroenterology, University Hospital Würzburg, Würzburg, Germany.

BACKGROUND: Owing to their rapid development, artificial intelligence (AI) 
technologies offer a great promise for gastroenterology practice and research. 
At present, AI-guided image interpretation has already been used with success 
for endoscopic detection of early malignant lesions. Nonetheless, there are 
complex challenges and possible shortcomings that must be considered before full 
implementation can be realized.
SUMMARY: In this review, the current status of AI in endoscopy is summarized. 
Future perspectives and open questions for further studies are stressed.
KEY MESSAGES: The usage of AI algorithms for polyp detection in screening 
colonoscopy results in a significant increase in the adenoma detection rate, 
mainly attributed to the identification of diminutive polyps. Computer-aided 
characterization of colorectal polyps accompanies the detection, but further 
studies are needed to evaluate the clinical benefit. In contrast to colonoscopy, 
usage of AI in gastroscopy is currently rather limited. Regarding other fields 
of endoscopic imaging, capsule endoscopy is the ideal imaging platform for AI, 
due to the potential of saving time in the video analysis.

OBJECTIVE: Identify how novel datasets and digital health technology, including 
both analytics-based and artificial intelligence (AI)-based tools, can be used 
to assess non-clinical, social determinants of health (SDoH) for population 
health improvement.
METHODS: A state-of-the-art literature review with systematic methods was 
performed on MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases and the grey 
literature to identify recently published articles (2013-2018) for 
evidence-based qualitative synthesis. Following single review of titles and 
abstracts, two independent reviewers assessed eligibility of full-texts using 
predefined criteria and extracted data into predefined templates.
RESULTS: The search yielded 2,714 unique database records of which 65 met 
inclusion criteria. Most studies were conducted retrospectively in a United 
States community setting. Identity, behavioral, and economic factors were 
frequently identified social determinants, due to reliance on administrative 
data. Three main themes were identified: 1) improve access to data and 
technology with policy - advance the standardization and interoperability of 
data, and expand consumer access to digital health technologies; 2) leverage 
data aggregation - enrich SDoH insights using multiple data sources, and use 
analytics-based and AI-based methods to aggregate data; and 3) use 
analytics-based and AI-based methods to assess and address SDoH - retrieve SDoH 
in unstructured and structured data, and provide contextual care management 
sights and community-level interventions.
CONCLUSIONS: If multiple datasets and advanced analytical technologies can be 
effectively integrated, and consumers have access to and literacy of technology, 
more SDoH insights can be identified and targeted to improve public health. This 
study identified examples of AI-based use cases in public health informatics, 
and this literature is very limited.

(1) To explore the potential impact of an AI dual-energy CT (DECT) prototype on 
decision making and workflows by investigating its capabilities to differentiate 
COVID-19 from immunotherapy-related pneumonitis. (2) Methods: From 3 April 2020 
to 12 February 2021, DECT from biometrically matching patients with COVID-19, 
pneumonitis, and inconspicuous findings were selected from our clinical routine. 
Three blinded readers independently scored each pulmonary lobe analogous to 
CO-RADS. Inter-rater agreement was determined with an intraclass correlation 
coefficient (ICC). Averaged perfusion metrics per lobe (iodine uptake in mg, 
volume without vessels in ml, iodine concentration in mg/mL) were extracted 
using manual segmentation and an AI DECT prototype. A generalized linear mixed 
model was used to investigate metric validity and potential distinctions at 
equal CO-RADS scores. Multinomial regression measured the contribution "Reader", 
"CO-RADS score", and "perfusion metrics" to diagnosis. The time to diagnosis was 
measured for manual vs. AI segmentation. (3) Results: We included 105 patients 
(62 ± 13 years, mean BMI 27 ± 2). There were no significant differences between 
manually and AI-extracted perfusion metrics (p = 0.999). Regardless of the 
CO-RADS score, iodine uptake and concentration per lobe were significantly 
higher in COVID-19 than in pneumonitis (p < 0.001). In regression, iodine uptake 
had a greater contribution to diagnosis than CO-RADS scoring (Odds Ratio (OR) = 
1.82 [95%CI 1.10-2.99] vs. OR = 0.20 [95%CI 0.14-0.29]). The AI prototype 
extracted the relevant perfusion metrics significantly faster than radiologists 
(10 ± 1 vs. 15 ± 2 min, p < 0.001). (4) Conclusions: The investigated AI 
prototype positively impacts decision making and workflows by extracting 
perfusion metrics that differentiate COVID-19 from visually similar pneumonitis 
significantly faster than radiologists.

The worst performance rule (WPR) describes the phenomenon that individuals' 
slowest responses in a task are often more predictive of their intelligence than 
their fastest or average responses. To explain this phenomenon, it was 
previously suggested that occasional lapses of attention during task completion 
might be associated with particularly slow reaction times. Because less 
intelligent individuals should experience lapses of attention more frequently, 
reaction time distribution should be more heavily skewed for them than for more 
intelligent people. Consequently, the correlation between intelligence and 
reaction times should increase from the lowest to the highest quantile of the 
response time distribution. This attentional lapses account has some intuitive 
appeal, but has not yet been tested empirically. Using a hierarchical modeling 
approach, we investigated whether the WPR pattern would disappear when including 
different behavioral, self-report, and neural measurements of attentional lapses 
as predictors. In a sample of N = 85, we found that attentional lapses accounted 
for the WPR, but effect sizes of single covariates were mostly small to very 
small. We replicated these results in a reanalysis of a much larger previously 
published data set. Our findings render empirical support to the attentional 
lapses account of the WPR.

To improve the diagnosis of Lupus Nephritis (LN), a multilevel LN image 
segmentation method is developed in this paper based on an improved slime mould 
algorithm. The search of the optimal threshold set is key to multilevel 
thresholding image segmentation (MLTIS). It is well known that swarm-based 
methods are more efficient than the traditional methods because of the high 
complexity in finding the optimal threshold, especially when performing image 
partitioning at high threshold levels. However, swarm-based methods tend to 
obtain the poor quality of the found segmentation thresholds and fall into local 
optima during the process of segmentation. Therefore, this paper proposes an 
ASMA-based MLTIS approach by combining an improved slime mould algorithm 
(ASMA),  where ASMA is mainly implemented by introducing the position update 
mechanism of the artificial bee colony (ABC) into the SMA. To prove the 
superiority of the ASMA-based MLTIS method, we first conducted a comparison 
experiment between ASMA and 11 peers using 30 test functions. The experimental 
results fully demonstrate that ASMA can obtain high-quality solutions and almost 
does not suffer from premature convergence. Moreover, using standard images and 
LN images, we compared the ASMA-based MLTIS method with other peers and 
evaluated the segmentation results using three evaluation indicators called 
PSNR, SSIM, and FSIM. The proposed ASMA can be an excellent swarm intelligence 
optimization method that can maintain a delicate balance during the segmentation 
process of LN images, and thus the ASMA-based MLTIS method has great potential 
to be used as an image segmentation method for LN images. The lastest updates 
for the SMA algorithm are available in https://aliasgharheidari.com/SMA.html.

BACKGROUND: Managing patient expectations is important to ensuring patient 
satisfaction in aesthetic medicine. To this end, computer technology developed 
to photograph, digitize, and manipulate three-dimensional (3D) objects has been 
applied to the female breast. However, the systems remain complex, physically 
cumbersome, and extremely expensive.
OBJECTIVES: The authors of the current study wish to introduce the plastic 
surgery community to BreastGAN, a portable, artificial intelligence 
(AI)-equipped tool trained on real clinical images to simulate breast 
augmentation outcomes.
METHODS: Charts of all patients who underwent bilateral breast augmentation 
performed by the senior author were retrieved and analyzed. Frontal before and 
after images were collected from each patient's chart, cropped in a standardized 
fashion, and used to train a neural network designed to manipulate before images 
to simulate a surgical result. AI-generated frontal after images were then 
compared with the real surgical results.
RESULTS: Standardizing the evaluation of surgical results is a timeless 
challenge which persists in the context of AI-synthesized after images. In this 
study, AI-generated images were comparable to real surgical results.
CONCLUSIONS: This study features a portable, cost-effective neural network 
trained on real clinical images and designed to simulate surgical results 
following bilateral breast augmentation. Tools trained on a larger dataset of 
standardized surgical image pairs will be the subject of future studies.

BACKGROUND: Clinical management of subsolid nodules (SSNs) is defined by the 
suspicion of tumor invasiveness. We sought to develop an artificial intelligent 
(AI) algorithm for invasiveness assessment of lung adenocarcinoma manifesting as 
radiological SSNs. We investigated the performance of this algorithm in 
classification of SSNs related to invasiveness.
METHODS: A retrospective chest computed tomography (CT) dataset of 1,589 SSNs 
was constructed to develop (85%) and internally test (15%) the proposed AI 
diagnostic tool, SSNet. Diagnostic performance was evaluated in the hold-out 
test set and was further tested in an external cohort of 102 SSNs. Three 
thoracic surgeons and three radiologists were required to evaluate the 
invasiveness of SSNs on both test datasets to investigate the clinical utility 
of the proposed SSNet.
RESULTS: In the differentiation of invasive adenocarcinoma (IA), SSNet achieved 
a similar area under the curve [AUC; 0.914, 95% confidence interval (CI): 
0.813-0.987] with that of the 6 doctors (0.900, 95% CI: 0.867-0.922). When 
interpreting with the assistance of SSNet, the sensitivity of junior doctors, 
specificity of senior doctor, and their accuracy were significantly improved. In 
the external test, SSNet (AUC: 0.949, 95% CI: 0.884-1.000) achieved a better AUC 
than doctors (AUC: 0.883, 95% CI: 0.826-0.939) whose AUC increased (AUC: 0.908, 
95% CI: 0.847-0.982) with SSNet assistance. In the histological subtype 
classifications, SSNet achieved better performance than practicing doctors. The 
AUCs of doctors were significantly improved with the assistance of SSNet in both 
4-category and 3-category classifications to 0.836 (95% CI: 0.811-0.862) and 
0.852 (95% CI: 0.825-0.882), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The AI diagnostic system achieved non-inferior performance to 
doctors, and will potentially improve diagnostic performance and efficiency in 
SSN evaluation.

BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a large-scale global 
epidemic, impacting international politics and the economy. At present, there is 
no particularly effective medicine and treatment plan. Therefore, it is urgent 
and significant to find new technologies to diagnose early, isolate early, and 
treat early. Multimodal data drove artificial intelligence (AI) can potentially 
be the option. During the COVID-19 Pandemic, AI provided cutting-edge 
applications in disease, medicine, treatment, and target recognition. This paper 
reviewed the literature on the intersection of AI and medicine to analyze and 
compare different AI model applications in the COVID-19 Pandemic, evaluate their 
effectiveness, show their advantages and differences, and introduce the main 
models and their characteristics.
METHODS: We searched PubMed, arXiv, medRxiv, and Google Scholar through February 
2020 to identify studies on AI applications in the medical areas for the 
COVID-19 Pandemic.
RESULTS: We summarize the main AI applications in six areas: (I) epidemiology, 
(II) diagnosis, (III) progression, (IV) treatment, (V) psychological health 
impact, and (VI) data security. The ongoing development in AI has significantly 
improved prediction, contact tracing, screening, diagnosis, treatment, 
medication, and vaccine development for the COVID-19 Pandemic and reducing human 
intervention in medical practice.
DISCUSSION: This paper provides strong advice for using AI-based auxiliary tools 
for related applications of human diseases. We also discuss the clinicians' role 
in the further development of AI. They and AI researchers can integrate AI 
technology with current clinical processes and information systems into 
applications. In the future, AI personnel and medical workers will further 
cooperate closely.

OBJECTIVE: In this review, we aim to present frontier studies in patients with 
lung cancer as it related to artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted 
decision-making and summarize the latest advances, challenges and future trend 
in this field.
BACKGROUND: Despite increasing survival rate in cancer patients over the last 
decades, lung cancer remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide. The 
early diagnosis, accurate evaluation and individualized treatment are vital 
approaches to improve the survival rate of patients with lung cancer. Thus, 
decision making based on these approaches requires accuracy and efficiency 
beyond manpower. Recent advances in AI and precision medicine have provided a 
fertile environment for the development of AI-based models. These models have 
the potential to assist radiologists and oncologists in detecting lung cancer, 
predicting prognosis and developing personalized treatment plans for better 
outcomes of the patients.
METHODS: We searched literature from 2000 through July 31th, 2021 in 
Medline/PubMed, the Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, ACM Digital Library, 
INSPEC and EMBASE. Key words such as "artificial intelligence", "AI", "deep 
learning", "lung cancer", "NSCLC", "SCLC" were combined to identify related 
literatures. These literatures were then selected by two independent authors. 
Articles chosen by only one author will be examined by another author to 
determine whether this article was relative and valuable. The selected 
literatures were read by all authors and discussed to draw reliable conclusions.
CONCLUSIONS: AI, especially for those based on deep learning and radiomics, is 
capable of assisting clinical decision making from many aspects, for its 
quantitatively interpretation of patients' information and its potential to deal 
with the dynamics, individual differences and heterogeneity of lung cancer. 
Hopefully, remaining problems such as insufficient data and poor 
interpretability may be solved to put AI-based models into clinical practice.

OBJECTIVE: To summarize the current evidence regarding the applications, 
workflow, and limitations of artificial intelligence (AI) in the management of 
patients pathologically-diagnosed with lung cancer.
BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is one of the most common cancers and the leading cause 
of cancer-related deaths worldwide. AI technologies have been applied to daily 
medical workflow and have achieved an excellent performance in predicting 
histopathologic subtypes, analyzing gene mutation profiles, and assisting in 
clinical decision-making for lung cancer treatment. More advanced deep learning 
for classifying pathologic images with minimal human interactions has been 
developed in addition to the conventional machine learning scheme.
METHODS: Studies were identified by searching databases, including PubMed, 
EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library, up to February 2021 without 
language restrictions.
CONCLUSIONS: A number of studies have evaluated AI pipelines and confirmed that 
AI is robust and efficacious in lung cancer diagnosis and decision-making, 
demonstrating that AI models are a useful tool for assisting oncologists in 
health management. Although several limitations that pose an obstacle for the 
widespread use of AI schemes persist, the unceasing refinement of AI techniques 
is poised to overcome such problems. Thus, AI technology is a promising tool for 
use in diagnosing and managing lung cancer.

In this golden age of rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), 
researchers and surgeons realized that AI could contribute to healthcare in all 
aspects, especially in surgery. The popularity of low-dose computed tomography 
(LDCT) and the improvement of the video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) 
not only bring opportunities for thoracic surgery but also bring challenges on 
the way forward. Preoperatively localizing lung nodules precisely, 
intraoperatively identifying anatomical structures accurately, and avoiding 
complications requires a visual display of individuals' specific anatomy for 
surgical simulation and assistance. With the advance of AI-assisted display 
technologies, including 3D reconstruction/3D printing, virtual reality (VR), 
augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR), computer tomography (CT) imaging 
in thoracic surgery has been fully utilized for transforming 2D images to 3D 
model, which facilitates surgical teaching, planning, and simulation. 
AI-assisted display based on surgical videos is a new surgical application, 
which is still in its infancy. Notably, it has potential applications in 
thoracic surgery education, surgical quality evaluation, intraoperative 
assistance, and postoperative analysis. In this review, we illustrated the 
current AI-assisted display applications based on CT in thoracic surgery; 
focused on the emerging AI applications in thoracic surgery based on surgical 
videos by reviewing its relevant researches in other surgical fields and 
anticipate its potential development in thoracic surgery.

BACKGROUND: Machine learning (ML) is developing fast with promising prospects 
within medicine and already has several applications in perioperative care. We 
conducted a scoping review to examine the extent and potential limitations of ML 
implementation in perioperative anesthetic care, specifically in cardiac surgery 
patients.
METHODS: We mapped the current literature by searching three databases: MEDLINE 
(Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), and Cochrane Library. Articles were eligible if they 
reported on perioperative ML use in the field of cardiac surgery with relevance 
to anesthetic practices. Data on the applicability of ML and comparability to 
conventional statistical methods were extracted.
RESULTS: Forty-six articles on ML relevant to the work of the anesthesiologist 
in cardiac surgery were identified. Three main categories emerged: (I) event and 
risk prediction, (II) hemodynamic monitoring, and (III) automation of 
echocardiography. Prediction models based on ML tend to behave similarly to 
conventional statistical methods. Using dynamic hemodynamic or ultrasound data 
in ML models, however, shifts the potential to promising results.
CONCLUSIONS: ML in cardiac surgery is increasingly used in perioperative 
anesthetic management. The majority is used for prediction purposes similar to 
conventional clinical scores. Remarkable ML model performances are achieved when 
using real-time dynamic parameters. However, beneficial clinical outcomes of ML 
integration have yet to be determined. Nonetheless, the first steps introducing 
ML in perioperative anesthetic care for cardiac surgery have been taken.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article is to review the current applications of 
artificial intelligence in thoracic surgery, from diagnosis and pulmonary 
disease management, to preoperative risk-assessment, surgical planning, and 
outcomes prediction.
BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence implementation in healthcare settings is 
rapidly growing, though its widespread use in clinical practice is still 
limited. The employment of machine learning algorithms in thoracic surgery is 
wide-ranging, including all steps of the clinical pathway.
METHODS: We performed a narrative review of the literature on Scopus, PubMed and 
Cochrane databases, including all the relevant studies published in the last ten 
years, until March 2021.
CONCLUSION: Machine learning methods are promising encouraging results 
throughout the key issues of thoracic surgery, both clinical, organizational, 
and educational. Artificial intelligence-based technologies showed remarkable 
efficacy to improve the perioperative evaluation of the patient, to assist the 
decision-making process, to enhance the surgical performance, and to optimize 
the operating room scheduling. Still, some concern remains about data supply, 
protection, and transparency, thus further studies and specific consensus 
guidelines are needed to validate these technologies for daily common practice.
KEYWORDS: Artificial intelligence (AI); thoracic surgery; machine learning; lung 
resection; perioperative medicine.

OBJECTIVE: This review will focus on how AI-and, specifically, deep learning-can 
be applied to complement aspects of the current healthcare system. We describe 
how AI-based tools can augment existing clinical workflows by discussing the 
applications of AI to worklist prioritization and patient triage, the 
performance-boosting effects of AI as a second reader, and the use of AI to 
facilitate complex quantifications. We also introduce prominent examples of 
recent AI applications, such as tuberculosis screening in resource-constrained 
environments, the detection of lung cancer with screening CT, and the diagnosis 
of COVID-19. We also provide examples of prognostic predictions and new 
discoveries beyond existing clinical practices.
BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown promising performance for 
thoracic diseases, particularly in the field of thoracic radiology. However, it 
has not yet been established how AI-based image analysis systems can help 
physicians in clinical practice.
METHODS: This review included peer-reviewed research articles on AI in the 
thorax published in English between 2015 and 2021.
CONCLUSIONS: With advances in technology and appropriate preparation of 
physicians, AI could address various clinical problems that have not been solved 
due to a lack of clinical resources or technological limitations.
KEYWORDS: Artificial intelligence (AI); deep learning (DL); computer aided 
diagnosis (CAD); thoracic radiology; pulmonary medicine.

The rate of adenoma detection is the most reliable quality indicator of 
colonoscopy. Studies have reported that colonoscopy performed in morning has a 
higher adenoma detection rate (ADR) than that performed in the afternoon. These 
studies have explained that several physician-related factors such as undergoing 
an emergency procedure the night before colonoscopy, accumulated workload, and 
increased fatigue level in the afternoon might have led to such finding. 
However, several opposing articles have indicated that the time of day and ADR 
is not quite related. Complex confounding factors can impact study results. 
Colonoscopy withdrawal time and bowel preparation quality are key factors. 
However, queue list numbers, participation of academic fellows, nurses' 
assistance, and the number of colonoscopies allocated per hour are also notable 
factors. Recently, an attempt has been made to homogenize the ADR in the morning 
and afternoon through artificial intelligence-assisted colonoscopy. This review 
article introduces the history of this long-debated topic, discusses points to 
consider in real-world practice, and suggests new ideas for planning future 
research. By understanding this issue, the rate of adenoma detection during 
colonoscopy is expected to be improved further.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is among the leading causes of cancer incidence 
and death. Despite decades of research and development of new treatment options, 
the overall outcomes of patients with HCC continue to remain poor. There are 
areas of unmet need in risk prediction, early diagnosis, accurate 
prognostication, and individualized treatments for patients with HCC. Recent 
years have seen an explosive growth in the application of artificial 
intelligence (AI) technology in medical research, with the field of HCC being no 
exception. Among the various AI-based machine learning algorithms, deep learning 
algorithms are considered state-of-the-art techniques for handling and 
processing complex multimodal data ranging from routine clinical variables to 
high-resolution medical images. This article will provide a comprehensive review 
of the recently published studies that have applied deep learning for risk 
prediction, diagnosis, prognostication, and treatment planning for patients with 
HCC.

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and augmented realities into the 
medical field is being attempted by various researchers across the globe. As a 
matter of fact, most of the advanced technologies utilized by medical providers 
today have been borrowed and extrapolated from other industries. The 
introduction of AI into the field of hepatology and liver surgery is relatively 
a recent phenomenon. The purpose of this narrative review is to highlight the 
different AI concepts which are currently being tried to improve the care of 
patients with liver diseases. We end with summarizing emerging trends and major 
challenges in the future development of AI in hepatology and liver surgery.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most frequent neurodegenerative disorder 
following Alzheimer's disease. Advanced stages of PD, 4 or 5 of the Hoehn and 
Yahr Scale, are characterized by severe motor complications, limited mobility 
without assistance, risk of falling, and non-motor complications. The aim of 
this review was to provide a practical overview on specific artificial 
intelligence (AI) systems for the management of advanced stages of PD, as well 
as relevant technological limitations. The authors conducted a systematic search 
on PubMed and EMBASE with predefined keywords searching for studies published 
until December 2020. Full articles that satisfied the inclusion criteria were 
included in the systematic review. To minimize results bias, the reference list 
was manually searched for pertinent articles to identify any additional relevant 
missed publications. Exclusion criteria included the following: Other stages of 
PD than 4 and 5 of the Hoehn and Yahr Scale, case reports, reviews, practice 
guidelines, commentaries, opinions, letters, editorials, short surveys, articles 
in press, conference abstracts, conference papers, and abstracts published 
without a full article. The search identified 21 studies analyzing AI-based 
applications and robotic systems used for the management of advanced stages of 
PD, out of which 6 articles analyzed AI-based applications for autonomous 
management of pharmacologic therapy, 5 articles analyzed home-based telemedicine 
systems and 10 articles analysed robot-assisted gait training systems. The 
authors identified significant evidence demonstrating that current AI-based 
technologies are feasible for automatic management of patients with advanced 
stages of PD. Improving the quality of care and reducing the cost for patients 
and healthcare systems are the most important advantages.

Colonoscopy is an effective screening procedure in colorectal cancer prevention 
programs; however, colonoscopy practice can vary in terms of lesion detection, 
classification, and removal. Artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted decision 
support systems for endoscopy is an area of rapid research and development. The 
systems promise improved detection, classification, screening, and surveillance 
for colorectal polyps and cancer. Several recently developed applications for 
AI-assisted colonoscopy have shown promising results for the detection and 
classification of colorectal polyps and adenomas. However, their value for 
real-time application in clinical practice has yet to be determined owing to 
limitations in the design, validation, and testing of AI models under real-life 
clinical conditions. Despite these current limitations, ambitious attempts to 
expand the technology further by developing more complex systems capable of 
assisting and supporting the endoscopist throughout the entire colonoscopy 
examination, including polypectomy procedures, are at the concept stage. 
However, further work is required to address the barriers and challenges of AI 
integration into broader colonoscopy practice, to navigate the approval process 
from regulatory organizations and societies, and to support physicians and 
patients on their journey to accepting the technology by providing strong 
evidence of its accuracy and safety. This article takes a closer look at the 
current state of AI integration into the field of colonoscopy and offers 
suggestions for future research.

The COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) global pandemic has upended the normal 
pace of society at multiple levels-from daily activities in personal and 
professional lives to the way the sciences operate. Many laboratories have 
reported shortage in vital supplies, change in standard operating protocols, 
suspension of operations because of social distancing and stay-at-home 
guidelines during the pandemic. This global crisis has opened opportunities to 
leverage internet of things, connectivity, and artificial intelligence (AI) to 
build a connected laboratory automation platform. However, laboratory operations 
involve complex, multicomponent systems. It is unrealistic to completely 
automate the entire diversity of laboratories and processes. Recently, AI 
technology, particularly, game simulation has made significant strides in 
modeling and learning complex, multicomponent systems. Here, we present a 
cloud-based laboratory management and automation platform which combines 
multilayer information on a simulation-driven inference engine to plan and 
optimize laboratory operations under various constraints of COVID-19 and risk 
scenarios. The platform was used to assess the execution of two cell-based 
assays with distinct parameters in a real-life high-content screening laboratory 
scenario. The results show that the platform can provide a systematic framework 
for assessing laboratory operation scenarios under different conditions, 
quantifying tradeoffs, and determining the performance impact of specific 
resources or constraints, thereby enabling decision-making in a cost-effective 
manner. We envisage the laboratory management and automation platform to be 
further expanded by connecting it with sensors, robotic equipment, and other 
components of scientific operations to provide an integrated, end-to-end 
platform for scientific laboratory automation.

Background and Objectives: Hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance are not 
synonymous; if the risk of developing insulin resistance in adolescents is 
monitored, they do not necessarily have hyperinsulinemia. It is considered a 
condition of pre-diabetes and represents a condition of increased risk of 
developing DM (diabetes mellitus); it can exist for many years without people 
having the appropriate symptoms. This study aims to determine the risk of 
developing hyperinsulinemia at an early age in adolescents by examining which 
factors are crucial for its occurrence. Materials and Methods: The 
cross-sectional study lasting from 2019 to 2021 (2 years) was realized at the 
school children's department in the Valjevo Health Center, which included a 
total of 822 respondents (392 male and 430 female) children and adolescents aged 
12 to 17. All respondents underwent a regular, systematic examination scheduled 
for school children. BMI is a criterion according to which respondents are 
divided into three groups. Results: After summary analyzes of OGTT test 
respondents and calculated values of HOMA-IR (homeostatic model assessment for 
insulin resistance), the study showed that a large percentage of respondents, a 
total of 12.7%, are at risk for hyperinsulinemia. The research described in this 
paper aimed to use the most popular AI (artificial intelligence) model, ANN 
(artificial neural network), to show that 13.1% of adolescents are at risk, 
i.e., the risk is higher by 0.4%, which was shown by statistical tests as a 
significant difference. Conclusions: It is estimated that a model using three 
different ANN architectures, based on Taguchi's orthogonal vector plans, gives 
more precise and accurate results with much less error. In addition to 
monitoring changes in each individual's risk, the risk assessment of the entire 
monitored group is updated without having to analyze all data.

The diagnosis and treatment of non-melanoma skin cancer remain urgent problems. 
Histological examination of biopsy material-the gold standard of diagnosis-is an 
invasive procedure that requires a certain amount of time to perform. The 
ability to detect abnormal cells using fluorescence spectroscopy (FS) has been 
shown in many studies. This technique is rapidly expanding due to its safety, 
relative cost-effectiveness, and efficiency. However, skin lesion FS-based 
diagnosis is challenging due to a number of single overlapping spectra emitted 
by fluorescent molecules, making it difficult to distinguish changes in the 
overall spectrum and the molecular basis for it. We applied deep learning (DL) 
algorithms to quantitatively assess the ability of FS to differentiate between 
pathologies and normal skin. A total of 137 patients with various forms of 
primary and recurrent basal cell carcinoma (BCC) were observed by a 
multispectral laser-based device with a built-in neural network (NN) "DSL-1". We 
measured the fluorescence spectra of suspected non-melanoma skin cancers and 
compared them with "normal" skin spectra. These spectra were input into DL 
algorithms to determine whether the skin is normal, pigmented normal, benign, or 
BCC. The preoperative differential AI-driven fluorescence diagnosis method 
correctly predicted the BCC lesions. We obtained an average sensitivity of 62% 
and average specificity of 83% in our experiments. Thus, the presented "DSL-1" 
diagnostic device can be a viable tool for the real-time diagnosis and guidance 
of non-melanoma skin cancer resection.

BACKGROUND: Although several studies have been launched towards the prediction 
of risk factors for mortality and admission in the intensive care unit (ICU) in 
COVID-19, none of them focuses on the development of explainable AI models to 
define an ICU scoring index using dynamically associated biological markers.
METHODS: We propose a multimodal approach which combines explainable AI models 
with dynamic modeling methods to shed light into the clinical features of 
COVID-19. Dynamic Bayesian networks were used to seek associations among 
cytokines across four time intervals after hospitalization. Explainable gradient 
boosting trees were trained to predict the risk for ICU admission and mortality 
towards the development of an ICU scoring index.
RESULTS: Our results highlight LDH, IL-6, IL-8, Cr, number of monocytes, 
lymphocyte count, TNF as risk predictors for ICU admission and survival along 
with LDH, age, CRP, Cr, WBC, lymphocyte count for mortality in the ICU, with 
prediction accuracy 0.79 and 0.81, respectively. These risk factors were 
combined with dynamically associated biological markers to develop an ICU 
scoring index with accuracy 0.9.
CONCLUSIONS: to our knowledge, this is the first multimodal and explainable AI 
model which quantifies the risk of intensive care with accuracy up to 0.9 across 
multiple timepoints.

University, No 58, Zhongshan Er Road, Guangzhou 510080, China.

Biliary atresia is an aggressive liver disease of infancy and can cause death 
without timely surgical intervention. Early diagnosis of biliary atresia is 
critical to the recovery of bile drainage and long-term transplant-free 
survival. Ultrasound is recommended as the initial imaging strategy for the 
diagnosis of biliary atresia. Numerous ultrasound features have been proved 
helpful for the diagnosis of biliary atresia. In recent years, with the help of 
new technologies such as elastography ultrasound, contrast-enhanced ultrasound 
and artificial intelligence, the diagnostic performance of ultrasound has been 
significantly improved. In this review, various ultrasound features in the 
diagnosis of biliary atresia are summarized. A diagnostic decision flow chart 
for biliary atresia is proposed on the basis of the hybrid technologies, 
combining conventional ultrasound, elastography and contrast-enhanced 
ultrasound. In addition, the application of artificial intelligence in the 
diagnosis of biliary atresia with ultrasound images is also introduced.

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has become the leading diagnostic tool in 
modern ophthalmology. We are interested here in developing a support tool for 
the segmentation of retina layers. The proposed method relies on graph theory 
and geodesic distance. As each retina layer is characterised by different 
features, the proposed method interleaves various gradients during detection, 
such as horizontal and vertical gradients or open-closed gradients. The method 
was tested on a dataset of 750 OCT B-Scan Spectralis provided by the 
Ophthalmology Department of the County Emergency Hospital Cluj-Napoca. The 
method has smaller signed error on layers B1, B7 and B8, with the highest value 
of 0.43 pixels. The average value of signed error on all layers is -1.99 ± 1.14 
px. The average value for mean absolute error is 2.60 ± 0.95 px. Since the 
target is a support tool for the human agent, the ophthalmologist can intervene 
after each automatic step. Human intervention includes validation or fine tuning 
of the automatic segmentation. In line with design criteria advocated by 
explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) and human-centered AI, this approach 
gives more control and transparency as well as more of a global perspective on 
the segmentation process.

Biomarker identification is very important to differentiate the grade groups in 
the histopathological sections of prostate cancer (PCa). Assessing the cluster 
of cell nuclei is essential for pathological investigation. In this study, we 
present a computer-based method for cluster analyses of cell nuclei and 
performed traditional (i.e., unsupervised method) and modern (i.e., supervised 
method) artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for distinguishing the grade 
groups of PCa. Two datasets on PCa were collected to carry out this research. 
Histopathology samples were obtained from whole slides stained with hematoxylin 
and eosin (H&E). In this research, state-of-the-art approaches were proposed for 
color normalization, cell nuclei segmentation, feature selection, and 
classification. A traditional minimum spanning tree (MST) algorithm was employed 
to identify the clusters and better capture the proliferation and community 
structure of cell nuclei. K-medoids clustering and stacked ensemble machine 
learning (ML) approaches were used to perform traditional and modern AI-based 
classification. The binary and multiclass classification was derived to compare 
the model quality and results between the grades of PCa. Furthermore, a 
comparative analysis was carried out between traditional and modern AI 
techniques using different performance metrics (i.e., statistical parameters). 
Cluster features of the cell nuclei can be useful information for cancer 
grading. However, further validation of cluster analysis is required to 
accomplish astounding classification results.

(1) Background: Respiratory insufficiency with acute respiratory distress 
syndrome (ARDS) and multi-organ dysfunction leads to high mortality in COVID-19 
patients. In times of limited intensive care unit (ICU) resources, chest CTs 
became an important tool for the assessment of lung involvement and for patient 
triage despite uncertainties about the predictive diagnostic value. This study 
evaluated chest CT-based imaging parameters for their potential to predict 
in-hospital mortality compared to clinical scores. (2) Methods: 89 COVID-19 ICU 
ARDS patients requiring mechanical ventilation or continuous positive airway 
pressure mask ventilation were included in this single center retrospective 
study. AI-based lung injury assessment and measurements indicating pulmonary 
hypertension (PA-to-AA ratio) on admission CT, oxygenation indices, lung 
compliance and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores on ICU 
admission were assessed for their diagnostic performance to predict in-hospital 
mortality. (3) Results: CT severity scores and PA-to-AA ratios were not 
significantly associated with in-hospital mortality, whereas the SOFA score 
showed a significant association (p < 0.001). In ROC analysis, the SOFA score 
resulted in an area under the curve (AUC) for in-hospital mortality of 0.74 
(95%-CI 0.63-0.85), whereas CT severity scores (0.53, 95%-CI 0.40-0.67) and 
PA-to-AA ratios (0.46, 95%-CI 0.34-0.58) did not yield sufficient AUCs. These 
results were consistent for the subgroup of more critically ill patients with 
moderate and severe ARDS on admission (oxygenation index <200, n = 53) with an 
AUC for SOFA score of 0.77 (95%-CI 0.64-0.89), compared to 0.55 (95%-CI 
0.39-0.72) for CT severity scores and 0.51 (95%-CI 0.35-0.67) for PA-to-AA 
ratios. (4) Conclusions: Severe COVID-19 disease is not limited to lung (vessel) 
injury but leads to a multi-organ involvement. The findings of this study 
suggest that risk stratification should not solely be based on chest CT 
parameters but needs to include multi-organ failure assessment for COVID-19 ICU 
ARDS patients for optimized future patient management and resource allocation.

Persons with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have impaired mentalizing skills. In 
this study, a group of persons with ASD traits (high-AQ scores) initially 
received sham tDCS before completing a pre-test in two mentalizing tasks: false 
belief and self-other judgments. Over the next week, on four consecutive days, 
they received sessions of anodal electrical stimulation (a-tDCS) over the right 
temporo-parietal junction (rTPJ), a region frequently associated with the theory 
of mind. On the last day, after the stimulation session, they completed a new 
set of mentalizing tasks. A control group (with low-AQ scores) matched in age, 
education and intelligence received just sham stimulation and completed the same 
pre-test and post-test. The results showed that the high-AQ group improved their 
performance (faster responses), after a-tDCS, in the false belief and in the 
self-other judgments of mental features, whereas they did not change performance 
in the false photographs or the self-other judgments of physical features. These 
selective improvements cannot be attributed to increased familiarity with the 
tasks, because the performance of the low-AQ control group remained stable about 
one week later. Therefore, our study provides initial proof that tDCS could be 
used to improve mentalizing skills in persons with ASD traits.

Semi-quantitative scoring is a method that is widely used to estimate the 
quantity of proteins on chromogen-labelled immunohistochemical (IHC) tissue 
sections. However, it suffers from several disadvantages, including its lack of 
objectivity and the fact that it is a time-consuming process. Our aim was to 
test a recently established artificial intelligence (AI)-aided digital image 
analysis platform, Pathronus, and to compare it to conventional scoring by five 
observers on chromogenic IHC-stained slides belonging to three experimental 
groups. Because Pathronus operates on grayscale 0-255 values, we transformed the 
data to a seven-point scale for use by pathologists and scientists. The accuracy 
of these methods was evaluated by comparing statistical significance among 
groups with quantitative fluorescent IHC reference data on subsequent tissue 
sections. The pairwise inter-rater reliability of the scoring and converted 
Pathronus data varied from poor to moderate with Cohen's kappa, and overall 
agreement was poor within every experimental group using Fleiss' kappa. Only the 
original and converted that were obtained from Pathronus original were able to 
reproduce the statistical significance among the groups that were determined by 
the reference method. In this study, we present an AI-aided software that can 
identify cells of interest, differentiate among organelles, protein specific 
chromogenic labelling, and nuclear counterstaining after an initial training 
period, providing a feasible and more accurate alternative to semi-quantitative 
scoring.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread worldwide, and medicinal 
resources have become inadequate in several regions. Computed tomography (CT) 
scans are capable of achieving precise and rapid COVID-19 diagnosis compared to 
the RT-PCR test. At the same time, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, 
including machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), find it useful to design 
COVID-19 diagnoses using chest CT scans. In this aspect, this study concentrates 
on the design of an artificial intelligence-based ensemble model for the 
detection and classification (AIEM-DC) of COVID-19. The AIEM-DC technique aims 
to accurately detect and classify the COVID-19 using an ensemble of DL models. 
In addition, Gaussian filtering (GF)-based preprocessing technique is applied 
for the removal of noise and improve image quality. Moreover, a shark 
optimization algorithm (SOA) with an ensemble of DL models, namely recurrent 
neural networks (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and gated recurrent unit 
(GRU), is employed for feature extraction. Furthermore, an improved bat 
algorithm with a multiclass support vector machine (IBA-MSVM) model is applied 
for the classification of CT scans. The design of the ensemble model with 
optimal parameter tuning of the MSVM model for COVID-19 classification shows the 
novelty of the work. The effectiveness of the AIEM-DC technique take place on 
benchmark CT image data set, and the results reported the promising 
classification performance of the AIEM-DC technique over the recent 
state-of-the-art approaches.

The isolation of a virus using cell culture to observe its cytopathic effects 
(CPEs) is the main method for identifying the viruses in clinical specimens. 
However, the observation of CPEs requires experienced inspectors and excessive 
time to inspect the cell morphology changes. In this study, we utilized 
artificial intelligence (AI) to improve the efficiency of virus identification. 
After some comparisons, we used ResNet-50 as a backbone with single and 
multi-task learning models to perform deep learning on the CPEs induced by 
influenza, enterovirus, and parainfluenza. The accuracies of the single and 
multi-task learning models were 97.78% and 98.25%, respectively. In addition, 
the multi-task learning model increased the accuracy of the single model from 
95.79% to 97.13% when only a few data of the CPEs induced by parainfluenza were 
provided. We modified both models by inserting a multiplexer and de-multiplexer 
layer, respectively, to increase the correct rates for known cell lines. In 
conclusion, we provide a deep learning structure with ResNet-50 and the 
multi-task learning model and show an excellent performance in identifying 
virus-induced CPEs.

We present a summary of research that we have conducted employing AI to better 
understand human morality. This summary adumbrates theoretical fundamentals and 
considers how to regulate development of powerful new AI technologies. The 
latter research aim is benevolent AI, with fair distribution of benefits 
associated with the development of these and related technologies, avoiding 
disparities of power and wealth due to unregulated competition. Our approach 
avoids statistical models employed in other approaches to solve moral dilemmas, 
because these are "blind" to natural constraints on moral agents, and risk 
perpetuating mistakes. Instead, our approach employs, for instance, 
psychologically realistic counterfactual reasoning in group dynamics. The 
present paper reviews studies involving factors fundamental to human moral 
motivation, including egoism vs. altruism, commitment vs. defaulting, guilt vs. 
non-guilt, apology plus forgiveness, counterfactual collaboration, among other 
factors fundamental in the motivation of moral action. These being basic 
elements in most moral systems, our studies deliver generalizable conclusions 
that inform efforts to achieve greater sustainability and global benefit, 
regardless of cultural specificities in constituents.

In the last decade, the number of studies about machine learning algorithms 
applied to sports, e.g., injury forecasting and athlete performance prediction, 
have rapidly increased. Due to the number of works and experiments already 
present in the state-of-the-art regarding machine-learning techniques in sport 
science, the aim of this narrative review is to provide a guideline describing a 
correct approach for training, validating, and testing machine learning models 
to predict events in sports science. The main contribution of this narrative 
review is to highlight any possible strengths and limitations during all the 
stages of model development, i.e., training, validation, testing, and 
interpretation, in order to limit possible errors that could induce misleading 
results. In particular, this paper shows an example about injury forecaster that 
provides a description of all the features that could be used to predict 
injuries, all the possible pre-processing approaches for time series analysis, 
how to correctly split the dataset to train and test the predictive models, and 
the importance to explain the decision-making approach of the white and black 
box models.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on hospitals and healthcare 
systems around the world. The cost of business disruption combined with 
lingering COVID-19 costs has placed many public hospitals on a course to 
insolvency. To quickly return to financial stability, hospitals should implement 
efficiency measure. An average technical efficiency (ATE) model made up of data 
envelopment analysis (DEA) and stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) for assessing 
efficiency in public hospitals during and after the COVID-19 pandemic is 
offered. The DEA method is a non-parametric method that requires no information 
other than the input and output quantities. SFA is a parametric method that 
considers stochastic noise in data and allows statistical testing of hypotheses 
about production structure and degree of inefficiency. The rationale for using 
these two competing approaches is to balance each method's strengths, weaknesses 
and introduce a novel integrated approach. To show the applicability and 
efficacy of the proposed hybrid VRS-CRS-SFA (VCS) model, a case study is 
presented.

Multifunctionality, interference-free signal readout, and quantum effect are 
important considerations for flexible sensors equipped within a single unit 
towards further miniaturization. To address these criteria, we present the 
slotted carbon nanotube (CNT) junction features tunable Fano resonance driven by 
flexoelectricity, which could serve as an ideal multimodal sensory receptor. 
Based on extensive ab initio calculations, we find that the effective Fano 
factor can be used as a temperature-insensitive extrinsic variable for sensing 
the bending strain, and the Seebeck coefficient can be used as a 
strain-insensitive intrinsic variable for detecting temperature. Thus, this 
dual-parameter permits simultaneous sensing of temperature and strain without 
signal interference. We further demonstrate the applicability of this slotted 
junction to ultrasensitive chemical sensing which enables precise determination 
of donor-type, acceptor-type, and inert molecules. This is due to the 
enhancement or counterbalance between flexoelectric and chemical gating. 
Flexoelectric gating would preserve the electron-hole symmetry of the slotted 
junction whereas chemical gating would break it. As a proof-of-concept 
demonstration, the slotted CNT junction provides an excellent quantum platform 
for the development of multistimuli sensation in artificial intelligence at the 
molecular scale.

A novel evolutionary approach for Explainable Artificial Intelligence is 
presented: the "Evolved Explanations" model (EvEx). This methodology combines 
Local Interpretable Model Agnostic Explanations (LIME) with Multi-Objective 
Genetic Algorithms to allow for automated segmentation parameter tuning in image 
classification tasks. In this case, the dataset studied is Patch-Camelyon, 
comprised of patches from pathology whole slide images. A publicly available 
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was trained on this dataset to provide a 
binary classification for presence/absence of lymph node metastatic tissue. In 
turn, the classifications are explained by means of evolving segmentations, 
seeking to optimize three evaluation goals simultaneously. The final explanation 
is computed as the mean of all explanations generated by Pareto front 
individuals, evolved by the developed genetic algorithm. To enhance 
reproducibility and traceability of the explanations, each of them was generated 
from several different seeds, randomly chosen. The observed results show 
remarkable agreement between different seeds. Despite the stochastic nature of 
LIME explanations, regions of high explanation weights proved to have good 
agreement in the heat maps, as computed by pixel-wise relative standard 
deviations. The found heat maps coincide with expert medical segmentations, 
which demonstrates that this methodology can find high quality explanations 
(according to the evaluation metrics), with the novel advantage of automated 
parameter fine tuning. These results give additional insight into the inner 
workings of neural network black box decision making for medical data.

We propose CX-ToM, short for counterfactual explanations with theory-of-mind, a 
new explainable AI (XAI) framework for explaining decisions made by a deep 
convolutional neural network (CNN). In contrast to the current methods in XAI 
that generate explanations as a single shot response, we pose explanation as an 
iterative communication process, i.e., dialogue between the machine and human 
user. More concretely, our CX-ToM framework generates a sequence of explanations 
in a dialogue by mediating the differences between the minds of the machine and 
human user. To do this, we use Theory of Mind (ToM) which helps us in explicitly 
modeling the human's intention, the machine's mind as inferred by the human, as 
well as human's mind as inferred by the machine. Moreover, most state-of-the-art 
XAI frameworks provide attention (or heat map) based explanations. In our work, 
we show that these attention-based explanations are not sufficient for 
increasing human trust in the underlying CNN model. In CX-ToM, we instead use 
counterfactual explanations called fault-lines which we define as follows: given 
an input image I for which a CNN classification model M predicts class c pred , 
a fault-line identifies the minimal semantic-level features (e.g., stripes on 
zebra), referred to as explainable concepts, that need to be added to or deleted 
from I to alter the classification category of I by M to another specified class 
c alt . Extensive experiments verify our hypotheses, demonstrating that our 
CX-ToM significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art XAI models.

The rapidly developing artificial intelligence (AI) requires revolutionary 
computing architectures to break the energy efficiency bottleneck caused by the 
traditional von Neumann computing architecture. In addition, the emerging 
brain-machine interface also requires computational circuitry that can conduct 
large parallel computational tasks with low energy cost and good 
biocompatibility. Neuromorphic computing, a novel computational architecture 
emulating human brains, has drawn significant interest for the aforementioned 
applications due to its low energy cost, capability to parallelly process 
large-scale data, and biocompatibility. Most efforts in the domain of 
neuromorphic computing focus on addressing traditional AI problems, such as 
handwritten digit recognition and file classification. Here, we demonstrate for 
the first time that current neuromorphic computing techniques can be used to 
solve key machine learning questions in cheminformatics. We predict the band 
gaps of small-molecule organic semiconductors and classify chemical reaction 
types with a simulated neuromorphic circuitry. Our work can potentially guide 
the design and fabrication of elementary devices and circuitry for neuromorphic 
computing specialized for chemical purposes.

The study aimed to explore the application value of lumbar Magnetic Resonance 
Imaging (MRI) images processed by artificial intelligence algorithms in 
evaluating the efficacy of chinkuei shin chewan decoction (a traditional Chinese 
medicine to nourish the kidney) in the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis 
(LSS). Specifically, 110 LSS patients admitted to the hospital were selected as 
the research subjects. They were randomly divided into the control group 
(n = 55) and experimental group (n = 55) according to different treatment 
methods. The control group was treated with traditional medicine, and the 
experimental group additionally took chinkuei shin chewan decoction on its 
basis. Based on the traditional U-net algorithm, a U-net registration algorithm 
based on artificial intelligence was designed by introducing the information 
entropy theory, and the algorithm was applied to the lumbar MRI image evaluation 
of LSS patients. Compared with the traditional U-net algorithm, the artificial 
intelligence-based U-net registration algorithm had a decreased noise level (P < 
0.05), the Jaccard (J) value (0.84) and the Dice value (0.93) increased 
significantly versus the traditional algorithm (J = 0.63, Dice = 0.81), and the 
characteristics of the image were more accurate. Before treatment, the Oswestry 
Disability Index (ODI) scores of the experimental group and the control group 
were 44.32 ± 6.45 and 43.32 ± 5.45, respectively. After treatment, the ODI 
scores of the two groups were 10.21 ± 5.05 and 17.09 ± 5.23, respectively. Both 
showed significant improvement, while the improvement of the experimental group 
was more obvious than that of the control group (P < 0.05). The overall 
effective rates of the two groups of patients were 96.44% and 82.47%, 
respectively, and the experimental group was significantly higher than the 
control group (P < 0.05). Under the U-net registration algorithm based on 
artificial intelligence, the diagnostic accuracy of lumbar MRI in the 
experimental group was 94.45%, significantly higher than 67.5% before the 
introduction of the algorithm (P < 0.05). In conclusion, chinkuei shin chewan 
decoction are effective for the treatment of LSS, and lumbar MRI based on the 
artificial intelligence U-net registration algorithm can evaluate the efficacy 
of LSS well and is worthy of promotion.

Radiologists' personal productivity and efficiency are critically important for 
both improving patient outcomes and protecting clinician well-being. There are 
several solutions that individuals can implement to improve personal 
productivity and efficiency in the radiology workroom. Strategies include 
understanding the psychology behind productivity, using personal productivity 
methodologies to accomplish daily tasks, and learning to modulate stress to 
optimize performance. Institutional infrastructure requirements include a robust 
departmental commitment to information technology and informatics, including 
universal log-in systems, internal websites, and dashboards. The workstation 
itself can be optimized by utilizing hanging protocols, customized keyboard 
shortcuts, hotkeys, advanced scripts, gaming mice, and other input devices. 
Personal devices like smartphones can be harnessed to maximize productivity by 
using online storage applications and radiology-specific applications to augment 
knowledge. Reading room layouts must be designed to minimize interruptions and 
workstations must consider ergonomics to prevent fatigue and strain. 
High-efficiency teams also need to be created to allow radiologists to delegate 
non-clinical tasks to reduce administrative burdens. Lastly, continued advances 
in artificial intelligence including the use of smart report templates will lead 
to substantial gains in radiologists' productivity and efficiency.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the most sought-after innovations in the 
financial industry. However, with its growing popularity, there also is the call 
for AI-based models to be understandable and transparent. However, 
understandably explaining the inner mechanism of the algorithms and their 
interpretation is entirely audience-dependent. The established literature fails 
to match the increasing number of explainable AI (XAI) methods with the 
different stakeholders' explainability needs. This study addresses this gap by 
exploring how various stakeholders within the Swiss financial industry view 
explainability in their respective contexts. Based on a series of interviews 
with practitioners within the financial industry, we provide an in-depth review 
and discussion of their view on the potential and limitation of current XAI 
techniques needed to address the different requirements for explanations.

OBJECTIVE: The medical record of Chinese medicine is a miniature of the 
theoretical system of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), with a time-honored 
history in a real-world setting and a firm place in medicine. In modern times, 
people have emphasized the value and standardization of TCM cases. The aim of 
this study was to explore the historical origins and developments of TCM case 
records.
METHODS: A chronological narrative style was used to divide the development 
history of TCM case records into early (1600 BC-220 AD), middle (220-1911 AD), 
and modern periods (1912-till now). The historical context of the origin and 
development of TCM case records was analyzed through the evolution of the format 
and content of the case recording files with the specific documents and 
distinctive cases.
RESULTS: From the early to middle period, the development of TCM case record had 
experienced four periods: the budding, blossoming, maturity, and heyday. In 
modern times, they presented the following characteristics: A, the establishment 
and development of the discipline of TCM medical records; B, the standardization 
of the writing format of TCM medical records; C, a large number of books 
concentrating on recording and studying TCM medical records, especially those of 
prestigious veteran TCM doctors; D, the proliferation of TCM case reports 
published in journals; E, the establishment of TCM medical records databases and 
application platforms integrating computer programs and artificial intelligence; 
F, many reporting guidelines have been developed in order to improve the 
reporting quality of case report in TCM.
CONCLUSIONS: The study analyzed and illustrated the characteristics of TCM case 
records of different dynasties in terms of writing content and format. TCM case 
record is a relatively young discipline in spite of its ancient origins. TCM 
case records still have far-reaching significance for the inheritance and 
development of TCM theory and clinical experience. From the wisdom of history, 
its positive impact has just been revalued to be validated and it will continue 
to develop.

This study investigates the relationship between digital financial inclusion, 
external financing, and the innovation performance of high-tech enterprises in 
China. The choice of corporate financing methods is an important part of 
organizational behavioral psychology, and different financing models will have a 
certain effect on organizational performance, especially in the digital economy 
environment. Therefore, based on resource dependence theory and financing 
constraint theory, the present study utilizes the panel data collected from the 
China Stock Market & Accounting Research (CSMAR) database from 2011 to 2020 of 
112 companies in the Yangtze River Delta region and the "The Peking University 
Digital Financial Inclusion Index of China (PKU-DFIIC)" released by the Peking 
University Digital Finance Research Center and Ant Financial Group. The results 
show that the Digital Financial Inclusion Index (DFIIC) has a significant 
positive correlation with the innovation performance of high-tech enterprises. 
The higher the level of debt financing, the stronger the role of digital 
financial inclusion in promoting innovation performance. Investigating the DFIIC 
in terms of coverage breadth and usage depth, we find that usage depth does not 
significantly encourage innovation performance. The effect of the interaction 
between coverage breadth and external financing is consistent with the results 
for the DFIIC. The study suggests that equity financing promotes the usage depth 
of the DFIIC in state-owned enterprises. In contrast, debt financing promotes 
the coverage breadth of non-state-owned enterprises. Finally, we propose 
relevant policy recommendations based on the research results. It includes 
in-depth popularization of inclusive finance in the daily operations of 
enterprises at the technical level, refinement of external financing policy 
incentives for enterprises based on the characteristics of ownership, and 
strengthening the research of technologies such as big data, artificial 
intelligence (AI), and cloud computing. The paper presents a range of 
theoretical and practical implications for practitioners and academics relevant 
to high-tech enterprises.

The COVID-19 pandemic has adverse consequences on human psychology and behavior 
long after initial recovery from the virus. These COVID-19 health sequelae, if 
undetected and left untreated, may lead to more enduring mental health problems, 
and put vulnerable individuals at risk of developing more serious 
psychopathologies. Therefore, an early distinction of such vulnerable 
individuals from those who are more resilient is important to undertake timely 
preventive interventions. The main aim of this article is to present a 
comprehensive multimodal conceptual approach for addressing these potential 
psychological and behavioral mental health changes using state-of-the-art tools 
and means of artificial intelligence (AI). Mental health COVID-19 recovery 
programs at post-COVID clinics based on AI prediction and prevention strategies 
may significantly improve the global mental health of ex-COVID-19 patients. Most 
COVID-19 recovery programs currently involve specialists such as pulmonologists, 
cardiologists, and neurologists, but there is a lack of psychiatrist care. The 
focus of this article is on new tools which can enhance the current limited 
psychiatrist resources and capabilities in coping with the upcoming challenges 
related to widespread mental health disorders. Patients affected by COVID-19 are 
more vulnerable to psychological and behavioral changes than non-COVID 
populations and therefore they deserve careful clinical psychological screening 
in post-COVID clinics. However, despite significant advances in research, the 
pace of progress in prevention of psychiatric disorders in these patients is 
still insufficient. Current approaches for the diagnosis of psychiatric 
disorders largely rely on clinical rating scales, as well as self-rating 
questionnaires that are inadequate for comprehensive assessment of ex-COVID-19 
patients' susceptibility to mental health deterioration. These limitations can 
presumably be overcome by applying state-of-the-art AI-based tools in diagnosis, 
prevention, and treatment of psychiatric disorders in acute phase of disease to 
prevent more chronic psychiatric consequences.

Neural Systems.

Denmark, Odense, Denmark.

Understanding the real-time dynamical mechanisms of neural systems remains a 
significant issue, preventing the development of efficient neural technology and 
user trust. This is because the mechanisms, involving various neural 
spatial-temporal ingredients [i.e., neural structure (NS), neural dynamics (ND), 
neural plasticity (NP), and neural memory (NM)], are too complex to interpret 
and analyze altogether. While advanced tools have been developed using 
explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), node-link diagram, topography map, 
and other visualization techniques, they still fail to monitor and visualize all 
of these neural ingredients online. Accordingly, we propose here for the first 
time "NeuroVis," real-time neural spatial-temporal information measurement and 
visualization, as a method/tool to measure temporal neural activities and their 
propagation throughout the network. By using this neural information along with 
the connection strength and plasticity, NeuroVis can visualize the NS, ND, NM, 
and NP via i) spatial 2D position and connection, ii) temporal color gradient, 
iii) connection thickness, and iv) temporal luminous intensity and change of 
connection thickness, respectively. This study presents three use cases of 
NeuroVis to evaluate its performance: i) function approximation using a modular 
neural network with recurrent and feedforward topologies together with 
supervised learning, ii) robot locomotion control and learning using the same

Systematic reviews are used to collect relevant literature to answer a research 
question in a way that is clear, thorough, unbiased and reproducible. They are 
implemented as a standard method in the domain of food safety to obtain a 
literature overview on the state-of-the-art research related to food safety 
topics of interest. A disadvantage to systematic reviews, however, is that this 
process is time-consuming and requires expert domain knowledge. The work 
reported here aims to reduce the time needed by an expert to screen all possible 
relevant articles by applying machine learning techniques to classify the 
articles automatically as either relevant or not relevant. Eight different 
machine learning algorithms and ensembles of all combinations of these 
algorithms were tested on two different systematic reviews on food safety (i.e. 
chemical hazards in cereals and leafy greens). The results showed that the best 
performance was obtained by an ensemble of naive Bayes and a support vector 
machine, resulting in an average decrease of 32.8% in the amount of articles the 
expert has to read and an average decrease in irrelevant articles of 57.8% while 
keeping 95% of the relevant articles. It was concluded that automatic 
classification of the literature in a systematic literature review can support 
experts in their task and save valuable time without compromising the quality of 
the review.

Recent explosive growth of 'make-on-demand' chemical libraries brought 
unprecedented opportunities but also significant challenges to the field of 
computer-aided drug discovery. To address this expansion of the accessible 
chemical universe, molecular docking needs to accurately rank billions of 
chemical structures, calling for the development of automated hit-selecting 
protocols to minimize human intervention and error. Herein, we report the 
development of an artificial intelligence-driven virtual screening pipeline that 
utilizes Deep Docking with Autodock GPU, Glide SP, FRED, ICM and QuickVina2 
programs to screen 40 billion molecules against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro). 
This campaign returned a significant number of experimentally confirmed 
inhibitors of Mpro enzyme, and also enabled to benchmark the performance of 
twenty-eight hit-selecting strategies of various degrees of stringency and 
automation. These findings provide new starting scaffolds for hit-to-lead 
optimization campaigns against Mpro and encourage the development of fully 
automated end-to-end drug discovery protocols integrating machine learning and 
human expertise.

The concept of an intelligent pandemic response network is gaining momentum 
during the current novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) era. A heterogeneous 
communication architecture is essential to facilitate collaborative and 
intelligent medical analytics in the fifth generation and beyond (B5G) networks 
to intelligently learn and disseminate pandemic-related information and 
diagnostic results. However, such a technique raises privacy issues pertaining 
to the health data of the patients. In this paper, we envision a 
privacy-preserving pandemic response network using a proof-of-concept, 
aerial-terrestrial network system serving mobile user entities/equipment (UEs). 
By leveraging the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), a lightweight federated 
learning model is proposed to collaboratively yet privately learn medical (e.g., 
COVID-19) symptoms with high accuracy using the data collected by individual UEs 
using ambient sensors and wearable devices. An asynchronous weight updating 
technique is introduced in federated learning to avoid redundant learning and 
save precious networking as well as computing resources of the UAVs/UEs. A 
use-case where an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based model is employed for 
COVID-19 detection from radiograph images is presented to demonstrate the 
effectiveness of our proposed approach.

To realize a machine learning (ML) model to estimate the dose of low molecular 
weight heparin to be administered, preventing thromboembolism events in COVID-19 
patients with active cancer. Methods: We used a dataset comprising 131 patients 
with active cancer and COVID-19. We considered five ML models: logistic 
regression, decision tree, random forest, support vector machine and Gaussian 
naive Bayes. We decided to implement the logistic regression model for our 
study. A model with 19 variables was analyzed. Data were randomly split into 
training (70%) and testing (30%) sets. Model performance was assessed by 
confusion matrix metrics on the testing data for each model as positive 
predictive value, sensitivity and F1-score. Results: We showed that the five 
selected models outperformed classical statistical methods of predictive 
validity and logistic regression was the most effective, being able to classify 
with an accuracy of 81%. The most relevant result was finding a patient-proof 
where python function was able to obtain the exact dose of low weight molecular 
heparin to be administered and thereby to prevent the occurrence of VTE. 
Conclusions: The world of machine learning and artificial intelligence is 
constantly developing. The identification of a specific LMWH dose for preventing 
VTE in very high-risk populations, such as the COVID-19 and active cancer 
population, might improve with the use of new training ML-based algorithms. 
Larger studies are needed to confirm our exploratory results.

The history of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is marked by 
technological advances linked to improvements in the knowledge of the mechanisms 
and kinetics of extracorporeal removal of solutes, and the pathophysiology of 
acute kidney injury (AKI) and other critical illnesses. In the present article, 
we review the main steps in the history of CRRT, from the discovery of 
continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration to its evolution into the current 
treatments and its early use in the treatment of AKI, to the novel sequential 
extracorporeal therapy. Beyond the technological advances, we describe the 
development of new medical specialties and a shared nomenclature to support 
clinicians and researchers in the broad and still evolving field of CRRT.

Precision medicine, providing the right therapeutic strategy for the right 
patient, could revolutionize management and prognosis of patients affected by 
cardiovascular diseases. Big data and artificial intelligence are pivotal for 
the realization of this ambitious design. In the setting of pulmonary arterial 
hypertension (PAH), the use of computational models and data derived from 
ambulatory implantable hemodynamic monitors could provide useful information for 
tailored treatment, as requested by precision medicine.

BACKGROUND: Liver metastases are a leading cause of cancer-associated deaths in 
patients affected by colorectal cancer (CRC). The multidisciplinary strategy to 
treat CRC is more effective when the radiological diagnosis is accurate and 
early. Despite the evolving technologies in radiological accuracy, the 
radiological diagnosis of Colorectal Cancer Liver Metastases (CRCLM) is still a 
key point. The aim of our study was to define a new patient representation 
different by Artificial Intelligence models, using Formal Methods (FMs), to help 
clinicians to predict the presence of liver metastasis when still undetectable 
using the standard protocols.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed from 2013 to 2020 the CT scan of nine 
patients affected by CRC who would develop liver lesions within 4 months and 8 
years. Seven patients developed liver metastases after primary staging before 
any liver surgery, and two patients were enrolled after R0 liver resection. 
Twenty-one patients were enrolled as the case control group (CCG). Regions of 
Interest (ROIs) were identified through manual segmentation on the medical 
images including only liver parenchyma and eventual benign lesions, avoiding 
major vessels and biliary ducts. Our predictive model was built based on 
formally verified radiomic features.
RESULTS: The precision of our methods is 100%, scheduling patients as positive 
only if they will be affected by CRCLM, showing a 93.3% overall accuracy. Recall 
was 77.8%.
CONCLUSION: FMs can provide an effective early detection of CRCLM before 
clinical diagnosis only through non-invasive radiomic features even in very 
heterogeneous and small clinical samples.

In recent decades, the elderly population has increased at higher rates than any 
other population group, resulting in an increase in age-related diseases such as 
neurodegenerative and cognitive impairment. To address this global health 
problem, it is necessary to search for new dietary strategies that can prevent 
the main neurocognitive problems associated with the ageing process. Therefore, 
the aim of the present study was to analyze the effect of cocoa flavanols and 
red berry anthocyanins on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve 
growth factor receptor (NGF-R) and to stablish the possible improvement in 
cognitive performance by using a battery of neurocognitive tests that included 
the Verbal Learning Test Spain-Complutense, the Spatial Recall Test 10/36 BRB-N, 
the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale III and IV, the STROOP Task and the Tower 
of London Test. A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study was performed 
in 60 healthy volunteers between 50 and 75 years old who consumed a cocoa 
powder, a red berries mixture or a combination of both for 12 weeks. After the 
intervention, we observed a reduction in the time needed to start (p = 0.031) 
and finish (p = 0.018) the neurocognitive test known as the Tower of London in 
all groups, but the decrease in time to finish the task was more pronounced in 
the intervention with the combination of cocoa-red berries group. We failed to 
show any significant difference in BDNF and NGF-R sera levels. However we found 
a negative correlation between BDNF and the number of movements required to 
finish the TOL in women (p = 0.044). In conclusion, our study showed an 
improvement in executive function, without any change in neurotrofin levels, for 
all intervention arms.

Artificial intelligence (AI) approaches continue to spread in almost every 
research and technology branch. However, a simple adaptation of AI methods and 
algorithms successfully exploited in one area to another field may face 
unexpected problems. Accelerating the discovery of new functional materials in 
chemical self-driving laboratories has an essential dependence on previous 
experimenters' experience. Self-driving laboratories help automate and 
intellectualize processes involved in discovering nanomaterials with required 
parameters that are difficult to transfer to AI-driven systems 
straightforwardly. It is not easy to find a suitable design method for 
self-driving laboratory implementation. In this case, the most appropriate way 
to implement is by creating and customizing a specific adaptive digital-centric 
automated laboratory with a data fusion approach that can reproduce a real 
experimenter's behavior. This paper analyzes the workflow of autonomous 
experimentation in the self-driving laboratory and distinguishes the core 
structure of such a laboratory, including sensing technologies. We propose a 
novel data-centric research strategy and multilevel data flow architecture for 
self-driving laboratories with the autonomous discovery of new functional 
nanomaterials.

Development of predictive maintenance (PdM) solutions is one of the key aspects 
of Industry 4.0. In recent years, more attention has been paid to data-driven 
techniques, which use machine learning to monitor the health of an industrial 
asset. The major issue in the implementation of PdM models is a lack of good 
quality labelled data. In the paper we present how unsupervised learning using a 
variational autoencoder may be used to monitor the wear of rolls in a hot strip 
mill, a part of a steel-making site. As an additional benchmark we use a 
simulated turbofan engine data set provided by NASA. We also use explainability 
methods in order to understand the model's predictions. The results show that 
the variational autoencoder slightly outperforms the base autoencoder 
architecture in anomaly detection tasks. However, its performance on the real 
use-case does not make it a production-ready solution for industry and should be 
a matter of further research. Furthermore, the information obtained from the 
explainability model can increase the reliability of the proposed artificial 
intelligence-based solution.

The COVID-19 Pandemic has punched a devastating blow on the majority of the 
world's population. Millions of people have been infected while hundreds of 
thousands have died of the disease throwing many families into mourning and 
other psychological torments. It has also crippled the economy of many countries 
of the world leading to job losses, high inflation, and dwindling Gross Domestic 
Product (GDP). The duo of social distancing and contact tracing are the major 
technological-based non-pharmaceutical public health intervention strategies 
adopted for combating the dreaded disease. These technologies have been deployed 
by different countries around the world to achieve effective and efficient means 
of maintaining appropriate distance and tracking the transmission pattern of the 
diseases or identifying those at high risk of infecting others. This paper aims 
to synthesize the research efforts on contact tracing and social distancing to 
minimize the spread of COVID-19. The paper critically and comprehensively 
reviews contact tracing technologies, protocols, and mobile applications (apps) 
that were recently developed and deployed against the coronavirus disease. 
Furthermore, the paper discusses social distancing technologies, appropriate 
methods to maintain distances, regulations, isolation/quarantine, and 
interaction strategies. In addition, the paper highlights different 
security/privacy vulnerabilities identified in contact tracing and social 
distancing technologies and solutions against these vulnerabilities. We also 
x-rayed the strengths and weaknesses of the various technologies concerning 
their application in contact tracing and social distancing. Finally, the paper 
proposed insightful recommendations and open research directions in contact 
tracing and social distancing that could assist researchers, developers, and 
governments in implementing new technological methods to combat the menace of 
COVID-19.

The most effective methods of preventing COVID-19 infection include maintaining 
physical distancing and wearing a face mask while in close contact with people 
in public places. However, densely populated areas have a greater incidence of 
COVID-19 dissemination, which is caused by people who do not comply with 
standard operating procedures (SOPs). This paper presents a prototype called 
PADDIE-C19 (Physical Distancing Device with Edge Computing for COVID-19) to 
implement the physical distancing monitoring based on a low-cost edge computing 
device. The PADDIE-C19 provides real-time results and responses, as well as 
notifications and warnings to anyone who violates the 1-m physical distance 
rule. In addition, PADDIE-C19 includes temperature screening using an MLX90614 
thermometer and ultrasonic sensors to restrict the number of people on specified 
premises. The Neural Network Processor (KPU) in Grove Artificial Intelligence 
Hardware Attached on Top (AI HAT), an edge computing unit, is used to accelerate 
the neural network model on person detection and achieve up to 18 frames per 
second (FPS). The results show that the accuracy of person detection with Grove 
AI HAT could achieve 74.65% and the average absolute error between measured and 
actual physical distance is 8.95 cm. Furthermore, the accuracy of the MLX90614 
thermometer is guaranteed to have less than 0.5 °C value difference from the 
more common Fluke 59 thermometer. Experimental results also proved that when 
cloud computing is compared to edge computing, the Grove AI HAT achieves the 
average performance of 18 FPS for a person detector (kmodel) with an average 56 
ms execution time in different networks, regardless of the network connection 
type or speed.

In this paper, the problem of the identification of undesirable events is 
discussed. Such events can be poorly represented in the historical data, and it 
is predominantly impossible to learn from past examples. The discussed issue is 
considered in the work in the context of two use cases in which vibration and 
temperature measurements collected by wireless sensors are analysed. These use 
cases include crushers at a coal-fired power plant and gantries in a steelworks 
converter. The awareness, resulting from the cooperation with industry, of the 
need for a system that works in cold start conditions and does not flood the 
machine operator with alarms was the motivation for proposing a new predictive 
maintenance method. The proposed solution is based on the methods of outlier 
identification. These methods are applied to the collected data that was 
transformed into a multidimensional feature vector. The novelty of the proposed 
solution stems from the creation of a methodology for the reduction of false 
positive alarms, which was applied to a system identifying undesirable events. 
This methodology is based on the adaptation of the system to the analysed data, 
the interaction with the dispatcher, and the use of the XAI (eXplainable 
Artificial Intelligence) method. The experiments performed on several data sets 
showed that the proposed method reduced false alarms by 90.25% on average in 
relation to the performance of the stand-alone outlier detection method. The 
obtained results allowed for the implementation of the developed method to a 
system operating in a real industrial facility. The conducted research may be 
valuable for systems with a cold start problem where frequent alarms can lead to 
discouragement and disregard for the system by the user.

This paper presents the development of a methodology to detect and evaluate 
faults in cable-stayed towers, which are part of the infrastructure of Brazil's 
interconnected electrical system. The proposed method increases system 
reliability and minimizes the risk of service failure and tower collapse through 
the introduction of predictive maintenance methods based on artificial 
intelligence, which will ultimately benefit the end consumer. The proposed 
signal processing and interpretation methods are based on a machine learning 
approach, where the tower vibration is acquired from accelerometers that measure 
the dynamic response caused by the effects of the environment on the towers 
through wind and weather conditions. Data-based models were developed to obtain 
a representation of health degradation, which is primarily based on the finite 
element model of the tower, subjected to wind excitation. This representation is 
also based on measurements using a mockup tower with different types of provoked 
degradation that was subjected to ambient changes in the laboratory. The sensor 
signals are preprocessed and submitted to an autoencoder neural network to 
minimize the dimensionality of the resources involved, being analyzed by a 
classifier, based on a Softmax configuration. The results of the proposed 
configuration indicate the possibility of early failure detection and evolution 
evaluation, providing an effective failure detection and monitoring system.

There is a constant risk of iron ore collapsing during its transfer between 
processing stages in beneficiation plants. Existing instrumentation is not only 
expensive but also complex and challenging to maintain. In this research, we 
propose using edge artificial intelligence for early detection of landslide risk 
based on images of iron ore transported on conveyor belts. During this work, we 
defined the device edge and the deep neural network model. Then, we built a 
prototype will to collect images that will be used for training the model. This 
model will be compressed for use in the device edge. This same prototype will be 
used for field tests of the model under operational conditions. In building the 
prototype, a real-time clock was used to ensure the synchronization of image 
records with the plant's process information, ensuring the correct 
classification of images by the process specialist. The results obtained in the 
field tests of the prototype with an accuracy of 91% and a recall of 96% 
indicate the feasibility of using deep learning at the edge to detect the type 
of iron ore and prevent its risk of avalanche.

Technology (KAIST), Daejeon 34141, Korea.

Recently, the use of quadrotors has increased in numerous applications, such as 
agriculture, rescue, transportation, inspection, and localization. Time-optimal 
quadrotor waypoint tracking is defined as controlling quadrotors to follow the 
given waypoints as quickly as possible. Although PID control is widely used for 
quadrotor control, it is not adaptable to environmental changes, such as various 
trajectories and dynamic external disturbances. In this work, we discover that 
adjusting PID control frequencies is necessary for adapting to environmental 
changes by showing that the optimal control frequencies can be different for 
different environments. Therefore, we suggest a method to schedule the PID 
position and attitude control frequencies for time-optimal quadrotor waypoint 
tracking. The method includes (1) a Control Frequency Agent (CFA) that finds the 
best control frequencies in various environments, (2) a Quadrotor Future 
Predictor (QFP) that predicts the next state of a quadrotor, and (3) combining 
the CFA and QFP for time-optimal quadrotor waypoint tracking under unknown 
external disturbances. The experimental results prove the effectiveness of the 
proposed method by showing that it reduces the travel time of a quadrotor for 
waypoint tracking.

Plant Factory is a newly emerging industry aiming at transforming crop 
production to an unprecedented model by leveraging industrial automation and 
informatics. However, today's plant factory and vertical farming industry are 
still in a primitive phase, and existing industrial cyber-physical systems are 
not optimal for a plant factory due to diverse application requirements on 
communication, computing and artificial intelligence. In this paper, we review 
use cases and requirements for future plant factories, and then dedicate an 
architecture that incorporates the communication and computing domains to plant 
factories with a preliminary proof-of-concept, which has been validated by both 
academic and industrial practices. We also call for a holistic co-design 
methodology that crosses the boundaries of communication, computing and 
artificial intelligence disciplines to guarantee the completeness of solution 
design and to speed up engineering implementation of plant factories and other 
industries sharing the same demands.

Developing cyber security is very necessary and has attracted considerable 
attention from academy and industry organizations worldwide. It is also very 
necessary to provide sustainable computing for the the Internet of Things (IoT). 
Machine learning techniques play a vital role in the cybersecurity of the IoT 
for intrusion detection and malicious identification. Thus, in this study, we 
develop new feature extraction and selection methods and for the IDS system 
using the advantages of the swarm intelligence (SI) algorithms. We design a 
feature extraction mechanism depending on the conventional neural networks 
(CNN). After that, we present an alternative feature selection (FS) approach 
using the recently developed SI algorithm, Aquila optimizer (AQU). Moreover, to 
assess the quality of the developed IDS approach, four well-known public 
datasets, CIC2017, NSL-KDD, BoT-IoT, and KDD99, were used. We also considered 
extensive comparisons to other optimization methods to verify the competitive 
performance of the developed method. The results show the high performance of 
the developed approach using different evaluation indicators.

Machinery condition monitoring and failure analysis is an engineering problem to 
pay attention to among all those being studied. Excessive vibration in a 
rotating system can damage the system and cannot be ignored. One option to 
prevent vibrations in a system is through preparation for them with a model. The 
accuracy of the model depends mainly on the type of model and the fitting that 
is attained. The non-linear model parameters can be complex to fit. Therefore, 
artificial intelligence is an option for performing this tuning. Within 
evolutionary computation, there are many optimization and tuning algorithms, the 
best known being genetic algorithms, but they contain many specific parameters. 
That is why algorithms such as the gray wolf optimizer (GWO) are alternatives 
for this tuning. There is a small number of mechanical applications in which the 
GWO algorithm has been implemented. Therefore, the GWO algorithm was used to fit 
non-linear regression models for vibration amplitude measurements in the radial 
direction in relation to the rotational frequency in a gas microturbine without 
considering temperature effects. RMSE and R2 were used as evaluation criteria. 
The results showed good agreement concerning the statistical analysis. The 2nd 
and 4th-order models, and the Gaussian and sinusoidal models, improved the fit. 
All models evaluated predicted the data with a high coefficient of determination 
(85-93%); the RMSE was between 0.19 and 0.22 for the worst proposed model. The 
proposed methodology can be used to optimize the estimated models with 
statistical tools.

Today, accurate and automated abnormality diagnosis and identification have 
become of paramount importance as they are involved in many critical and 
life-saving scenarios. To accomplish such frontiers, we propose three artificial 
intelligence models through the application of deep learning algorithms to 
analyze and detect anomalies in human heartbeat signals. The three proposed 
models include an attention autoencoder that maps input data to a 
lower-dimensional latent representation with maximum feature retention, and a 
reconstruction decoder with minimum remodeling loss. The autoencoder has an 
embedded attention module at the bottleneck to learn the salient activations of 
the encoded distribution. Additionally, a variational autoencoder (VAE) and a 
long short-term memory (LSTM) network is designed to learn the Gaussian 
distribution of the generative reconstruction and time-series sequential data 
analysis. The three proposed models displayed outstanding ability to detect 
anomalies on the evaluated five thousand electrocardiogram (ECG5000) signals 
with 99% accuracy and 99.3% precision score in detecting healthy heartbeats from 
patients with severe congestive heart failure.

In recent years, separating effective target signals from mixed signals has 
become a hot and challenging topic in signal research. The SI-BSS (Blind source 
separation (BSS) based on swarm intelligence (SI) algorithm) has become an 
effective method for the linear mixture BSS. However, the SI-BSS has the problem 
of incomplete separation, as not all the signal sources can be separated. An 
improved algorithm for BSS with SI based on signal cross-correlation (SI-XBSS) 
is proposed in this paper. Our method created a candidate separation pool that 
contains more separated signals than the traditional SI-BSS does; it identified 
the final separated signals by the value of the minimum cross-correlation in the 
pool. Compared with the traditional SI-BSS, the SI-XBSS was applied in six SI 
algorithms (Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), 
Differential Evolution (DE), Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA), Butterfly Optimization 
Algorithm (BOA), and Crow Search Algorithm (CSA)). The results showed that the 
SI-XBSS could effectively achieve a higher separation success rate, which was 
over 35% higher than traditional SI-BSS on average. Moreover, SI-SDR increased 
by 14.72 on average.

A fire is an extraordinary event that can damage property and have a notable 
effect on people's lives. However, the early detection of smoke and fire has 
been identified as a challenge in many recent studies. Therefore, different 
solutions have been proposed to approach the timely detection of fire events and 
avoid human casualties. As a solution, we used an affordable visual detection 
system. This method is possibly effective because early fire detection is 
recognized. In most developed countries, CCTV surveillance systems are installed 
in almost every public location to take periodic images of a specific area. 
Notwithstanding, cameras are used under different types of ambient light, and 
they experience occlusions, distortions of view, and changes in the resulting 
images from different camera angles and the different seasons of the year, all 
of which affect the accuracy of currently established models. To address these 
problems, we developed an approach based on an attention feature map used in a 
capsule network designed to classify fire and smoke locations at different 
distances outdoors, given only an image of a single fire and smoke as input. The 
proposed model was designed to solve two main limitations of the base capsule 
network input and the analysis of large-sized images, as well as to compensate 
the absence of a deep network using an attention-based approach to improve the 
classification of the fire and smoke results. In term of practicality, our 
method is comparable with prior strategies based on machine learning and deep 
learning methods. We trained and tested the proposed model using our datasets 
collected from different sources. As the results indicate, a high classification 
accuracy in comparison with other modern architectures was achieved. Further, 
the results indicate that the proposed approach is robust and stable for the 
classification of images from outdoor CCTV cameras with different viewpoints 
given the presence of smoke and fire.

Optimization Algorithm.

Chemical industrial parks, which act as critical infrastructures in many cities, 
need to be responsive to chemical gas leakage accidents. Once a chemical gas 
leakage accident occurs, risks of poisoning, fire, and explosion will follow. In 
order to meet the primary emergency response demands in chemical gas leakage 
accidents, source tracking technology of chemical gas leakage has been proposed 
and evolved. This paper proposes a novel method, Outlier Mutation Optimization 
(OMO) algorithm, aimed to quickly and accurately track the source of chemical 
gas leakage. The OMO algorithm introduces a random walk exploration mode and, 
based on Swarm Intelligence (SI), increases the probability of individual 
mutation. Compared with other optimization algorithms, the OMO algorithm has the 
advantages of a wider exploration range and more convergence modes. In the 
algorithm test session, a series of chemical gas leakage accident application 
examples with random parameters are first assumed based on the Gaussian plume 
model; next, the qualitative experiments and analysis of the OMO algorithm are 
conducted, based on the application example. The test results show that the OMO 
algorithm with default parameters has superior comprehensive performance, 
including the extremely high average calculation accuracy: the optimal value, 
which represents the error between the final objective function value obtained 
by the optimization algorithm and the ideal value, reaches 2.464e-15 when the 
number of sensors is 16; 2.356e-13 when the number of sensors is 9; and 
5.694e-23 when the number of sensors is 4. There is a satisfactory calculation 
time: 12.743 s/50 times when the number of sensors is 16; 10.304 s/50 times when 
the number of sensors is 9; and 8.644 s/50 times when the number of sensors is 
4. The analysis of the OMO algorithm's characteristic parameters proves the 
flexibility and robustness of this method. In addition, compared with other 
algorithms, the OMO algorithm can obtain an excellent leakage source tracing 
result in the application examples of 16, 9 and 4 sensors, and the accuracy 
exceeds the direct search algorithm, evolutionary algorithm, and other swarm 
intelligence algorithms.

Technological University, T12 P928 Cork, Ireland.

Machine learning applications are becoming more ubiquitous in dairy farming 
decision support applications in areas such as feeding, animal husbandry, 
healthcare, animal behavior, milking and resource management. Thus, the 
objective of this mapping study was to collate and assess studies published in 
journals and conference proceedings between 1999 and 2021, which applied machine 
learning algorithms to dairy farming-related problems to identify trends in the 
geographical origins of data, as well as the algorithms, features and evaluation 
metrics and methods used. This mapping study was carried out in line with PRISMA 
guidelines, with six pre-defined research questions (RQ) and a broad and 
unbiased search strategy that explored five databases. In total, 129 
publications passed the pre-defined selection criteria, from which relevant data 
required to answer each RQ were extracted and analyzed. This study found that 
Europe (43% of studies) produced the largest number of publications (RQ1), while 
the largest number of articles were published in the Computers and Electronics 
in Agriculture journal (21%) (RQ2). The largest number of studies addressed 
problems related to the physiology and health of dairy cows (32%) (RQ3), while 
the most frequently employed feature data were derived from sensors (48%) (RQ4). 
The largest number of studies employed tree-based algorithms (54%) (RQ5), while 
RMSE (56%) (regression) and accuracy (77%) (classification) were the most 
frequently employed metrics used, and hold-out cross-validation (39%) was the 
most frequently employed evaluation method (RQ6). Since 2018, there has been 
more than a sevenfold increase in the number of studies that focused on the 
physiology and health of dairy cows, compared to almost a threefold increase in 
the overall number of publications, suggesting an increased focus on this 
subdomain. In addition, a fivefold increase in the number of publications that 
employed neural network algorithms was identified since 2018, in comparison to a 
threefold increase in the use of both tree-based algorithms and statistical 
regression algorithms, suggesting an increasing utilization of neural 
network-based algorithms.

With the rapid development of society in recent decades, the wearable sensor has 
attracted attention for motion-based health care and artificial applications. 
However, there are still many limitations to applying them in real life, 
particularly the inconvenience that comes from their large size and non-flexible 
systems. To solve these problems, flexible small-sized sensors that use body 
motion as a stimulus are studied to directly collect more accurate and diverse 
signals. In particular, tactile sensors are applied directly on the skin and 
provide input signals of motion change for the flexible reading device. This 
review provides information about different types of tactile sensors and their 
working mechanisms that are piezoresistive, piezocapacitive, piezoelectric, and 
triboelectric. Moreover, this review presents not only the applications of the 
tactile sensor in motion sensing and health care monitoring, but also their 
contributions in the field of artificial intelligence in recent years. Other 
applications, such as human behavior studies, are also suggested.

A smart public transport system is expected to be an integral part of our human 
lives to improve our mobility and reduce the effect of our carbon footprint. The 
safety and ongoing maintenance of the smart public transport system from 
cyberattacks are vitally important. To provide more comprehensive protection 
against potential cyberattacks, we propose a novel approach that combines 
blockchain technology and a deep learning method that can better protect the 
smart public transport system. By the creation of signed and verified blockchain 
blocks and chaining of hashed blocks, the blockchain in our proposal can 
withstand unauthorized integrity attack that tries to forge sensitive transport 
maintenance data and transactions associated with it. A hybrid deep 
learning-based method, which combines autoencoder (AE) and multi-layer 
perceptron (MLP), in our proposal can effectively detect distributed denial of 
service (DDoS) attempts that can halt or block the urgent and critical exchange 
of transport maintenance data across the stakeholders. The experimental results 
of the hybrid deep learning evaluated on three different datasets (i.e., 
CICDDoS2019, CIC-IDS2017, and BoT-IoT) show that our deep learning model is 
effective to detect a wide range of DDoS attacks achieving more than 95% 
F1-score across all three datasets in average. The comparison of our approach 
with other similar methods confirms that our approach covers a more 
comprehensive range of security properties for the smart public transport 
system.

Maribor, 2000 Maribor, Slovenia.

To equip computers with human communication skills and to enable natural 
interaction between the computer and a human, intelligent solutions are required 
based on artificial intelligence (AI) methods, algorithms, and sensor 
technology. This study aimed at identifying and analyzing the state-of-the-art 
AI methods and algorithms and sensors technology in existing human-computer 
intelligent interaction (HCII) research to explore trends in HCII research, 
categorize existing evidence, and identify potential directions for future 
research. We conduct a systematic mapping study of the HCII body of research. 
Four hundred fifty-four studies published in various journals and conferences 
between 2010 and 2021 were identified and analyzed. Studies in the HCII and IUI 
fields have primarily been focused on intelligent recognition of emotion, 
gestures, and facial expressions using sensors technology, such as the camera, 
EEG, Kinect, wearable sensors, eye tracker, gyroscope, and others. Researchers 
most often apply deep-learning and instance-based AI methods and algorithms. The 
support sector machine (SVM) is the most widely used algorithm for various kinds 
of recognition, primarily an emotion, facial expression, and gesture. The 
convolutional neural network (CNN) is the often-used deep-learning algorithm for 
emotion recognition, facial recognition, and gesture recognition solutions.

Vibration is an indicator of performance degradation or operational safety 
issues of mobile cleaning robots. Therefore, predicting the source of vibration 
at an early stage will help to avoid functional losses and hazardous operational 
environments. This work presents an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled 
predictive maintenance framework for mobile cleaning robots to identify 
performance degradation and operational safety issues through vibration signals. 
A four-layer 1D CNN framework was developed and trained with a vibration signals 
dataset generated from the in-house developed autonomous steam mopping robot 
'Snail' with different health conditions and hazardous operational environments. 
The vibration signals were collected using an IMU sensor and categorized into 
five classes: normal operational vibration, hazardous terrain induced vibration, 
collision-induced vibration, loose assembly induced vibration, and structure 
imbalanced vibration signals. The performance of the trained predictive 
maintenance framework was evaluated with various real-time field trials with 
statistical measurement metrics. The experiment results indicate that our 
proposed predictive maintenance framework has accurately predicted the 
performance degradation and operational safety issues by analyzing the vibration 
signal patterns raised from the cleaning robot on different test scenarios. 
Finally, a predictive maintenance map was generated by fusing the vibration 
signal class on the cartographer SLAM algorithm-generated 2D environment map.

To avoid time-consuming, costly, and laborious experimental tests that require 
skilled personnel, an effort has been made to formulate the depth of wear of 
fly-ash concrete using a comparative study of machine learning techniques, 
namely random forest regression (RFR) and gene expression programming (GEP). A 
widespread database comprising 216 experimental records was constructed from 
available research. The database includes depth of wear as a response parameter 
and nine different explanatory variables, i.e., cement content, fly ash, water 
content, fine and coarse aggregate, plasticizer, air-entraining agent, age of 
concrete, and time of testing. The performance of the models was judged via 
statistical metrics. The GEP model gives better performance with R2 and ρ equals 
0.9667 and 0.0501 respectively and meet with the external validation criterion 
suggested in the previous literature. The k-fold cross-validation also verifies 
the accurateness of the model by evaluating R2, RSE, MAE, and RMSE. The 
sensitivity analysis of GEP equation indicated that the time of testing is the 
influential parameter. The results of this research can help the designers, 
practitioners, and researchers to quickly estimate the depth of wear of fly-ash 
concrete thus shortening its ecological susceptibilities that push to 
sustainable and faster construction from the viewpoint of environmentally 
friendly waste management.

Air classifier devices have a distinct advantage over other systems used to 
separate materials. They maximize the mill's capacity and therefore constitute 
efficient methods of reducing the energy consumption of crushing and grinding 
operations. Since improvement in their performance is challenging, the 
development of an efficient modeling system is of great practical significance. 
The paper introduces a novel, knowledge-based classification (FLClass) system of 
bulk materials. A wide range of operating parameters are considered in the 
study: the mean mass and the Sauter mean diameter of the fed material, 
classifier rotor speed, working air pressure, and test conducting time. The 
output variables are the Sauter mean diameter and the cut size of the 
classification product, as well as the performance of the process. The model was 
successfully validated against experimental data. The maximum relative error 
between the measured and predicted data is lower than 9%. The presented 
fuzzy-logic-based approach allows an optimization study of the process to be 
conducted. For the considered range of input parameters, the highest performance 
of the classification process is equal to almost 362 g/min. To the best of our 
knowledge, this paper is the first one available in open literature dealing with 
the fuzzy logic approach in modeling the air classification process of bulk 
materials.

The object of this research is concrete-filled steel tubes (CFST). The article 
aimed to develop a prediction Multiphysics model for the circular CFST column by 
using the Artificial Neural Network (ANN), the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference 
System (ANFIS) and the Gene Expression Program (GEP). The database for this 
study contains 1667 datapoints in which 702 are short CFST columns and 965 are 
long CFST columns. The input parameters are the geometric dimensions of the 
structural elements of the column and the mechanical properties of materials. 
The target parameters are the bearing capacity of columns, which determines 
their life cycle. A Multiphysics model was developed, and various statistical 
checks were applied using the three artificial intelligence techniques mentioned 
above. Parametric and sensitivity analyses were also performed on both short and 
long GEP models. The overall performance of the GEP model was better than the 
ANN and ANFIS models, and the prediction values of the GEP model were near 
actual values. The PI of the predicted Nst by GEP, ANN and ANFIS for training 
are 0.0416, 0.1423, and 0.1016, respectively, and for Nlg these values are 
0.1169, 0.2990 and 0.1542, respectively. Corresponding OF values are 0.2300, 
0.1200, and 0.090 for Nst, and 0.1000, 0.2700, and 0.1500 for Nlg. The 
superiority of the GEP method to the other techniques can be seen from the fact 
that the GEP technique provides suitable connections based on practical 
experimental work and does not rely on prior solutions. It is concluded that the 
GEP model can be used to predict the bearing capacity of circular CFST columns 
to avoid any laborious and time-consuming experimental work. It is also 
recommended that further research should be performed on the data to develop a 
prediction equation using other techniques such as Random Forest Regression and 
Multi Expression Program.

The SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes the COVID-19 pandemic, has had an 
unprecedented impact on healthcare requiring multidisciplinary innovation and 
novel thinking to minimize impact and improve outcomes. Wide-ranging disciplines 
have collaborated including diverse clinicians (radiology, microbiology, and 
critical care), who are working increasingly closely with data-science. This has 
been leveraged through the democratization of data-science with the increasing 
availability of easy to access open datasets, tutorials, programming languages, 
and hardware which makes it significantly easier to create mathematical models. 
To address the COVID-19 pandemic, such data-science has enabled modeling of the 
impact of the virus on the population and individuals for diagnostic, 
prognostic, and epidemiological ends. This has led to two large systematic 
reviews on this topic that have highlighted the two different ways in which this 
feat has been attempted: one using classical statistics and the other using more 
novel machine learning techniques. In this review, we debate the relative 
strengths and weaknesses of each method toward the specific task of predicting 
COVID-19 outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Adverse events in COVID-19 are difficult to predict. Risk 
stratification is encumbered by the need to protect healthcare workers. We 
hypothesize that artificial intelligence (AI) can help identify subtle signs of 
myocardial involvement in the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), which could help 
predict complications.
OBJECTIVE: Use intake ECGs from COVID-19 patients to train AI models to predict 
risk of mortality or major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE).
METHODS: We studied intake ECGs from 1448 COVID-19 patients (60.5% male, aged 
63.4 ± 16.9 years). Records were labeled by mortality (death vs discharge) or 
MACE (no events vs arrhythmic, heart failure [HF], or thromboembolic [TE] 
events), then used to train AI models; these were compared to conventional 
regression models developed using demographic and comorbidity data.
RESULTS: A total of 245 (17.7%) patients died (67.3% male, aged 74.5 ± 14.4 
years); 352 (24.4%) experienced at least 1 MACE (119 arrhythmic, 107 HF, 130 
TE). AI models predicted mortality and MACE with area under the curve (AUC) 
values of 0.60 ± 0.05 and 0.55 ± 0.07, respectively; these were comparable to 
AUC values for conventional models (0.73 ± 0.07 and 0.65 ± 0.10). There were no 
prominent temporal trends in mortality rate or MACE incidence in our cohort; 
holdout testing with data from after a cutoff date (June 9, 2020) did not 
degrade model performance.
CONCLUSION: Using intake ECGs alone, our AI models had limited ability to 
predict hospitalized COVID-19 patients' risk of mortality or MACE. Our models' 
accuracy was comparable to that of conventional models built using more in-depth 
information, but translation to clinical use would require higher sensitivity 
and positive predictive value. In the future, we hope that mixed-input AI models 
utilizing both ECG and clinical data may be developed to enhance predictive 
accuracy.

The sophistication of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has 
significantly advanced in the past decade. However, the observed 
unpredictability and variability of AI behavior in noisy signals is still 
underexplored and represents a challenge when trying to generalize AI behavior 
to real-life environments, especially for people with a speech disorder, who 
already experience reduced speech intelligibility. In the context of developing 
assistive technology for people with Parkinson's disease using automatic speech 
recognition (ASR), this pilot study reports on the performance of Google Cloud 
speech-to-text technology with dysarthric and healthy speech in the presence of 
multi-talker babble noise at different intensity levels. Despite sensitivities 
and shortcomings, it is possible to control the performance of these systems 
with current tools in order to measure speech intelligibility in real-life 
conditions.

West Attica, Athens, Greece.

INTRODUCTION: Machine learning is increasingly utilized over recent years in 
order to develop models that represent and solve problems in a variety of 
domains, including those of obstetrics and midwifery. The aim of this systematic 
review was to analyze research studies on machine learning and intelligent 
systems applications in midwifery and obstetrics.
METHODS: A thorough literature review was performed in four electronic databases 
(PubMed, APA PsycINFO, SCOPUS, ScienceDirect). Only articles that discussed 
machine learning and intelligent systems applications in midwifery and 
obstetrics, were considered in this review. Selected articles were critically 
evaluated as for their relevance and a contextual synthesis was conducted.
RESULTS: Thirty-two articles were included in this systematic review as they met 
the inclusion and methodological criteria specified in this study. The results 
suggest that machine learning and intelligent systems have produced successful 
models and systems in a broad list of midwifery and obstetrics topics, such as 
diagnosis, pregnancy risk assessment, fetal monitoring, bladder tumor, etc.
CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review suggests that machine learning represents a 
very promising area of artificial intelligence for the development of practical 
and highly effective applications that can support human experts, as well the 
investigation of a wide range of exciting opportunities for further research.

The study of how engagement in enriching cognitive, physical and social 
activities in childhood impacts cognitive function decades later will advance 
our understanding of how modifiable lifestyle activities promote cognition 
across the lifespan. 88 healthy older adults (aged 60-80 years) returned a 
retrospective questionnaire regarding their participation in seven lifestyle 
activities (musical instrument playing, language learning, sport participation, 
art/dance lessons, scouting, volunteering, family vacations) before age 13 
years. After controlling for current age, educational attainment, socioeconomic 
status of the mother and current engagement in lifestyle activities, a greater 
number of activities were significantly associated with better vocabulary 
abilities, episodic memory and fluid intelligence. The relationships with 
vocabulary and fluid intelligence were mediated by educational attainment. We 
postulate that engagement in a higher number of enriching early life activities 
is a reflection of both one's sociocontextual environment and engagement with 
that environment. This engagement leads to attributes relevant for educational 
aspirations/attainment, ultimately contributing to factors that have a lifespan 
impact on cognitive function.

INTRODUCTION: Sex-dependent risk factors may underlie sex differences in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: Using sex-stratified genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of AD, we 
evaluated associations of 12 traits with AD through polygenic risk scores (PRS) 
and Mendelian randomization (MR), and explored joint genetic architecture among 
significant traits by genomic structural equation modeling and network analysis.
RESULTS: AD was associated with lower PRS for premorbid cognitive performance, 
intelligence, and educational attainment. MR showed a causal role for the 
cognition-related traits in AD, particularly among females. Their joint genetic 
components encompassed RNA processing, neuron projection development, and cell 
cycle pathways that overlap with cellular senescence. Cholesterol and C-reactive 
protein showed pleiotropy but no causality with AD.
DISCUSSION: Lower cognitive reserve is causally related to AD. The stronger 
causal link between cognitive performance and AD in females, despite similar PRS 
between sexes, suggest these differences may result from gene-environmental 
interactions accumulated over the lifespan.

Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery effectively relieves symptoms and 
improves outcomes. However, patients undergoing CABG surgery typically have 
advanced coronary atherosclerotic disease and remain at high risk for symptom 
recurrence and adverse events. Functional non-invasive testing for ischaemia is 
commonly used as a gatekeeper for invasive coronary and graft angiography, and 
for guiding subsequent revascularisation decisions. However, performing and 
interpreting non-invasive ischaemia testing in patients post CABG is 
challenging, irrespective of the imaging modality used. Multiple factors 
including advanced multi-vessel native vessel disease, variability in coronary 
hemodynamics post-surgery, differences in graft lengths and vasomotor 
properties, and complex myocardial scar morphology are only some of the 
pathophysiological mechanisms that complicate ischaemia evaluation in this 
patient population. Systematic assessment of the impact of these challenges in 
relation to each imaging modality may help optimize diagnostic test selection by 
incorporating clinical information and individual patient characteristics. At 
the same time, recent technological advances in cardiac imaging including 
improvements in image quality, wider availability of quantitative techniques for 
measuring myocardial blood flow and the introduction of artificial 
intelligence-based approaches for image analysis offer the opportunity to 
re-evaluate the value of ischaemia testing, providing new insights into the 
pathophysiological processes that determine outcomes in this patient population.

Ensemble Learning.

Aortic dissection (AD), a dangerous disease threatening to human beings, has a 
hidden onset and rapid progression and has few effective methods in its early 
diagnosis. At present, although CT angiography acts as the gold standard on AD 
diagnosis, it is so expensive and time-consuming that it can hardly offer 
practical help to patients. Meanwhile, the artificial intelligence technology 
may provide a cheap but effective approach to building an auxiliary diagnosis 
model for improving the early AD diagnosis rate by taking advantage of the data 
of the general conditions of AD patients, such as the data about the basic 
inspection information. Therefore, this study proposes to hybrid five types of 
machine learning operators into an integrated diagnosis model, as an auxiliary 
diagnostic approach, to cooperate with the AD-clinical analysis. To improve the 
diagnose accuracy, the participating rate of each operator in the proposed model 
may adjust adaptively according to the result of the data learning. After a set 
of experimental evaluations, the proposed model, acting as the preliminary 
AD-discriminant, has reached an accuracy of over 80%, which provides a promising 
instance for medical colleagues.

Robot as Legal Person: Electronic Personhood in Robotics and Artificial 
Intelligence.

Brazil.

This paper seeks to investigate the proposal to create a legal (electronic) 
personhood for robots with artificial intelligence based on the European 
Parliament resolution with recommendations on Civil Law and Robotics. To this 
end, we highlight the various risks and problems present in this type of 
initiative, especially in view of the current trend of expanding legal 
subjectivity in various jurisdictions. In addition to an anthropomorphic 
rhetoric, we can observe the prevalence of a pragmatic line that seeks to be 
guided, mainly, by the model of corporations, without taking into account, 
however, problems present in the process of embodiment of companies and the 
particular function of the term legal person in the grammar of Law.

The communication between organs participates in the regulation of body 
homeostasis under physiological conditions and the progression and adaptation of 
diseases under pathological conditions. The communication between the liver and 
the eyes has been received more and more attention. In this review, we 
summarized some molecular mediators that can reflect the relationship between 
the liver and the eye, and then extended the metabolic relationship between the 
liver and the eye. We also summarized some typical diseases and phenotypes that 
have been able to reflect the liver-eye connection in the clinic, especially 
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and diabetic retinopathy (DR). The 
close connection between the liver and the eye is reflected through multiple 
pathways such as metabolism, oxidative stress, and inflammation. In addition, we 
presented the connection between the liver and the eye in traditional Chinese 
medicine, and introduced the fact that artificial intelligence may use the close 
connection between the liver and the eye to help us solve some practical 
clinical problems. Paying attention to liver-eye communication will help us have 
a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of certain communication between 
liver diseases and eyes, and provide new ideas for their potential therapeutic 
strategy.

Background: The emerging field of artificial intelligence (AI) will probably 
affect the practice for the next generation of doctors. However, the students' 
views on AI have not been largely investigated. Methods: An anonymous electronic 
survey on AI was designed for medical and dental students to explore: (1) 
sources of information about AI, (2) AI applications and concerns, (3) AI status 
as a topic in medicine, and (4) students' feelings and attitudes. The 
questionnaire was advertised on social media platforms in 2020. Security 
measures were employed to prevent fraudulent responses. Mann-Whitney U-test was 
employed for all comparisons. A sensitivity analysis was also performed by 
binarizing responses to express disagreement and agreement using the Chi-squared 
test. Results: Three thousand one hundred thirty-three respondents from 63 
countries from all continents were included. Most respondents reported having at 
least a moderate understanding of the technologies underpinning AI and of their 
current application, with higher agreement associated with being male (p < 
0.0001), tech-savvy (p < 0.0001), pre-clinical student (p < 0.006), and from a 
developed country (p < 0.04). Students perceive AI as a partner rather than a 
competitor (72.2%) with a higher agreement for medical students (p = 0.002). The 
belief that AI will revolutionize medicine and dentistry (83.9%) with greater 
agreement for students from a developed country (p = 0.0004) was noted. Most 
students agree that the AI developments will make medicine and dentistry more 
exciting (69.9%), that AI shall be part of the medical training (85.6%) and they 
are eager to incorporate AI in their future practice (99%). Conclusion: 
Currently, AI is a hot topic in medicine and dentistry. Students have a basic 
understanding of AI principles, a positive attitude toward AI and would like to 
have it incorporated into their training.

Cervical malignant growth is the fourth most typical reason for disease demise 
in women around the globe. Cervical cancer growth is related to human 
papillomavirus (HPV) contamination. Early screening made cervical cancer a 
preventable disease that results in minimizing the global burden of cervical 
cancer. In developing countries, women do not approach sufficient screening 
programs because of the costly procedures to undergo examination regularly, 
scarce awareness, and lack of access to the medical center. In this manner, the 
expectation of the individual patient's risk becomes very high. There are many 
risk factors relevant to malignant cervical formation. This paper proposes an 
approach named CervDetect that uses machine learning algorithms to evaluate the 
risk elements of malignant cervical formation. CervDetect uses Pearson 
correlation between input variables as well as with the output variable to 
pre-process the data. CervDetect uses the random forest (RF) feature selection 
technique to select significant features. Finally, CervDetect uses a hybrid 
approach by combining RF and shallow neural networks to detect Cervical Cancer. 
Results show that CervDetect accurately predicts cervical cancer, outperforms 
the state-of-the-art studies, and achieved an accuracy of 93.6%, mean squared 
error (MSE) error of 0.07111, false-positive rate (FPR) of 6.4%, and 
false-negative rate (FNR) of 100%.

Achieving The United Nations sustainable developments goals by 2030 will be a 
challenge. Researchers around the world are working toward this aim across the 
breadth of healthcare. Technology, and more especially artificial intelligence, 
has the ability to propel us forwards and support these goals but requires 
careful application. Artificial intelligence shows promise within healthcare and 
there has been fast development in ophthalmology, cardiology, diabetes, and 
oncology. Healthcare is starting to learn from commercial industry leaders who 
utilize fast and continuous testing algorithms to gain efficiency and find the 
optimum solutions. This article provides examples of how commercial industry is 
benefitting from utilizing AI and improving service delivery. The article then 
provides a specific example in eye health on how machine learning algorithms can 
be purposed to drive service delivery in a resource-limited setting by utilizing 
the novel study designs in response adaptive randomization. We then aim to 
provide six key considerations for researchers who wish to begin working with AI 
technology which include collaboration, adopting a fast-fail culture and 
developing a capacity in ethics and data science.

Urology), West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.

Background: Prior observational studies indicated that lower educational 
attainment (EA) is associated with higher COVID-19 risk, while these findings 
were vulnerable to bias from confounding factors. We aimed to clarify the causal 
effect of EA on COVID-19 susceptibility, hospitalization, and severity using 
Mendelian randomization (MR). Methods: We identified genetic instruments for EA 
from a large genome-wide association study (GWAS) (n = 1,131,881). Summary 
statistics for COVID-19 susceptibility (112,612 cases and 2,474,079 controls), 
hospitalization (24,274 cases and 2,061,529 controls), and severity (8,779 cases 
and 1,001,875 controls) were obtained from the COVID-19 Host Genetics 
Initiative. We used the single-variable MR (SVMR) and the multivariable MR 
(MVMR) controlling intelligence, income, body mass index, vigorous physical 
activity, sedentary behavior, smoking, and alcohol consumption to estimate the 
total and direct effects of EA on COVID-19 outcomes. Inverse variance weighted 
was the primary analysis method. All the statistical analyses were performed 
using R software. Results: Results from the SVMR showed that genetically 
predicted higher EA was correlated with a lower risk of COVID-19 susceptibility 
[odds ratio (OR) 0.86, 95% CI 0.84-0.89], hospitalization (OR 0.67, 95% CI 
0.62-0.73), and severity (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.58-0.79). EA still maintained its 
effects in most of the MVMR. Conclusion: Educational attainment is a predictor 
for susceptibility, hospitalization, and severity of COVID-19 disease. 
Population with lower EA should be provided with a higher prioritization to 
public health resources to decrease the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19.

PURPOSE: Machine learning has been applied to the diagnostic imaging of gliomas 
to augment classification, prognostication, segmentation, and treatment 
planning. A systematic literature review was performed to identify how machine 
learning has been applied to identify gliomas in datasets which include 
non-glioma images thereby simulating normal clinical practice.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four databases were searched by a medical librarian and 
confirmed by a second librarian for all articles published prior to February 1, 
2021: Ovid Embase, Ovid MEDLINE, Cochrane trials (CENTRAL), and Web of 
Science-Core Collection. The search strategy included both keywords and 
controlled vocabulary combining the terms for: artificial intelligence, machine 
learning, deep learning, radiomics, magnetic resonance imaging, glioma, as well 
as related terms. The review was conducted in stepwise fashion with abstract 
screening, full text screening, and data extraction. Quality of reporting was 
assessed using TRIPOD criteria.
RESULTS: A total of 11,727 candidate articles were identified, of which 12 
articles were included in the final analysis. Studies investigated the 
differentiation of normal from abnormal images in datasets which include gliomas 
(7 articles) and the differentiation of glioma images from non-glioma or normal 
images (5 articles). Single institution datasets were most common (5 articles) 
followed by BRATS (3 articles). The median sample size was 280 patients. 
Algorithm testing strategies consisted of five-fold cross validation (5 
articles), and the use of exclusive sets of images within the same dataset for 
training and for testing (7 articles). Neural networks were the most common type 
of algorithm (10 articles). The accuracy of algorithms ranged from 0.75 to 1.00 
(median 0.96, 10 articles). Quality of reporting assessment utilizing TRIPOD 
criteria yielded a mean individual TRIPOD ratio of 0.50 (standard deviation 
0.14, range 0.37 to 0.85).
CONCLUSION: Systematic review investigating the identification of gliomas in 
datasets which include non-glioma images demonstrated multiple limitations 
hindering the application of these algorithms to clinical practice. These 
included limited datasets, a lack of generalizable algorithm training and 
testing strategies, and poor quality of reporting. The development of more 
robust and heterogeneous datasets is needed for algorithm development. Future 
studies would benefit from using external datasets for algorithm testing as well 
as placing increased attention on quality of reporting standards.

Pituitary adenomas (PAs) are a group of tumors with complex and heterogeneous 
clinical manifestations. Early accurate diagnosis, individualized management, 
and precise prediction of the treatment response and prognosis of patients with 
PA are urgently needed. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) 
have garnered increasing attention to quantitatively analyze complex medical 
data to improve individualized care for patients with PAs. Therefore, we 
critically examined the current use of AI and ML in the management of patients 
with PAs, and we propose improvements for future uses of AI and ML in patients 
with PAs. AI and ML can automatically extract many quantitative features based 
on massive medical data; moreover, related diagnosis and prediction models can 
be developed through quantitative analysis. Previous studies have suggested that 
AI and ML have wide applications in early accurate diagnosis; individualized 
treatment; predicting the response to treatments, including surgery, 
medications, and radiotherapy; and predicting the outcomes of patients with PAs. 
In addition, facial imaging-based AI and ML, pathological picture-based AI and 
ML, and surgical microscopic video-based AI and ML have also been reported to be 
useful in assisting the management of patients with PAs. In conclusion, the 
current use of AI and ML models has the potential to assist doctors and patients 
in making crucial surgical decisions by providing an accurate diagnosis, 
response to treatment, and prognosis of PAs. These AI and ML models can improve 
the quality and safety of medical services for patients with PAs and reduce the 
complication rates of neurosurgery. Further work is needed to obtain more 
reliable algorithms with high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for the 
management of PA patients.

Temporal stability and change in manifest intelligence scores: Four 
complementary analytic approaches.

The temporal stability of psychological test scores is one prerequisite for 
their practical usability. This is especially true for intelligence test scores. 
In educational contexts, high stakes decisions with long-term consequences, such 
as placement in special education programs, are often based on intelligence test 
results. There are four different types of temporal stability: mean-level 
change, individual-level change, differential continuity, and ipsative 
continuity. We present statistical methods for investigating each type of 
stability. Where necessary, the methods were adapted for the specific challenges 
posed by intelligence research (e.g., controlling for general intelligence in 
lower order test scores). We provide step-by-step guidance for the application 
of the statistical methods and apply them to a real data set of 114 gifted 
students tested twice with a test-retest interval of 6 months. • Four different 
types of stability need to be investigated for a full picture of temporal 
stability in psychological research • Selection and adaption of the methods for 
the use in intelligence research • Complete protocol of the implementation.

PURPOSE: Since it is fast, inexpensive and increasingly portable, ultrasound can 
be used for early detection of Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip (DDH) in 
infants at point-of-care. However, accurate interpretation\is highly dependent 
on scan quality. Poor-quality images lead to misdiagnosis, but inexperienced 
users may not even recognize the deficiencies in the images. Currently, users 
assess scan quality subjectively, based on image landmarks which are prone to 
human errors. Instead, we propose using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to 
automatically assess scan quality.
METHODS: We trained separate Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models to detect 
presence of each of four commonly used ultrasound landmarks in each hip image: 
straight horizontal iliac wing, labrum, os ischium and midportion of the femoral 
head. We used 100 3D ultrasound (3DUS) images for training and validated the 
technique on a set of 107 3DUS images also scored for landmarks by three 
non-expert readers and one expert radiologist.
RESULTS: We got AI ≥ 85% accuracy for all four landmarks (ilium = 0.89, 
labrum = 0.94, os ischium = 0.85, femoral head = 0.98) as a binary classifier 
between adequate and inadequate scan quality. Our technique also showed 
excellent agreement with manual assessment in terms of Intraclass Correlation 
Coefficient (ICC) and Cohen's kappa coefficient (K) for ilium (ICC = 0.81, 
K = 0.56), os ischium (ICC = 0.89, K = 0.63) and femoral head (ICC = 0.83, 
K = 0.66), and moderate to good agreement for labrum (ICC = 0.65, K = 0.33).
CONCLUSION: This new technique could ensure high scan quality and facilitate 
more widespread use of ultrasound in population screening of DDH.

BACKGROUND: Developmental dysplasia of hip (DDH) represents a spectrum from 
acetabular dysplasia to fixed dislocation, giving disability through premature 
osteoarthritis. Most DDH cases continue to present without any known risk 
factors such as breech presentation, female sex, and family history. Incidence 
and population-based outcomes of DDH are difficult to reliably establish due to 
many DDH definitions and classifications using different types of examinations.
PURPOSE: This review takes a historical perspective on the role of imaging in 
DDH.
METHODS: Pelvic radiographs (X-Ray) were amongst the first medical images 
identifying DDH, but these have a limited role in infancy due to absent 
ossification. In the 1980s, ultrasound led to a large expansion in infant DDH 
screening. Unfortunately, even for well-trained users, DDH indices on ultrasound 
generally lack reproducibility, and have led to overdiagnosis of mild DDH. CT 
and MRI more thoroughly evaluate the 3D hip deformity in DDH, but are costly, 
less available and involve radiation dose and/or anaesthesia.
RESULTS: Recently 3D ultrasound has been used to characterize the 3D deformity 
of DDH more fully, with improved inter-observer reliability, particularly 
amongst novice users. 3D ultrasound is also well suited to automated image 
analysis, but high-resolution 3D probes are costly and not widely available.
CONCLUSION: Combining the latest handheld portable ultrasound probes and 
artificial intelligence analysis could lead to an inexpensive tool permitting 
practical mass population screening for DDH. Overall, our understanding of DDH 
is heavily influenced by the imaging tools used to visualize it and changing 
quickly with modern technology.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global health issue with a high rate of 
morbidity and mortality and a high rate of disease progression. Because there 
are no visible symptoms in the early stages of CKD, patients frequently go 
unnoticed. The early detection of CKD allows patients to receive timely 
treatment, slowing the disease's progression. Due to its rapid recognition 
performance and accuracy, machine learning models can effectively assist 
physicians in achieving this goal. We propose a machine learning methodology for 
the CKD diagnosis in this paper. This information was completely anonymized. As 
a reference, the CRISP-DM® model (Cross industry standard process for data 
mining) was used. The data were processed in its entirety in the cloud on the 
Azure platform, where the sample data was unbalanced. Then the processes for 
exploration and analysis were carried out. According to what we have learned, 
the data were balanced using the SMOTE technique. Four matching algorithms were 
used after the data balancing was completed successfully. Artificial 
intelligence (AI) (logistic regression, decision forest, neural network, and 
jungle of decisions). The decision forest outperformed the other machine 
learning models with a score of 92%, indicating that the approach used in this 
study provides a good baseline for solutions in the production.

Since industrialization, manufacturing has been an important pillar of a 
country's economic development. Under the dual pressure of the new trend of 
global manufacturing development and the loss of competitive advantage of 
manufacturing industry, it is especially important to accelerate the enhancement 
of national high technology innovation capacity and the optimization of high 
technology policy innovation management mechanism driven by advanced 
evolutionary Internet of Things (IoT) arithmetic. The main of this paper thus 
introduces the effective method of optimization of high technology policy 
innovation management mechanism driven by advanced evolutionary IoT arithmetic. 
To study the optimization of high technology policy innovation management 
mechanism, a conceptual analysis of currently popular information technologies, 
such as big data technologies, artificial intelligence technologies, and 
Internet of Things technologies, and an overview of the application of these 
technologies in microgrids are given. In the paper, all factors are studied 
using the STP innovation management mechanism-based approach, and finally, all 
factors are classified into two categories of cause and effect factors by this 
approach, and the importance of all factors is ranked. Secondly, a wind power 
prediction algorithm based on data mining technology and an improved algorithm 
and a PV power prediction algorithm based on a deep neural network were 
established with the technical support of high-tech information technology such 
as big data and artificial intelligence. Finally, the majorization of high 
technology policy innovation management mechanism driven by advanced 
evolutionary IoT arithmetic is proposed.

Motivations. Breast cancer is the second greatest cause of cancer mortality 
among women, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), and one of the 
most frequent illnesses among all women today. The influence is not confined to 
industrialized nations but also includes emerging countries since the authors 
believe that increased urbanization and adoption of Western lifestyles will lead 
to a rise in illness prevalence. Problem Statement. The breast cancer has become 
one of the deadliest diseases that women are presently facing. However, the 
causes of this disease are numerous and cannot be properly established. However, 
there is a huge difficulty in not accurately recognizing breast cancer in its 
early stages or prolonging the detection process. Methodology. In this research, 
machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that employs a variety of 
probabilistic, optimization, and statistical approaches to enable computers to 
learn from past data and find and recognize patterns from large or complicated 
groups. The advantage is particularly well suited to medical applications, 
particularly those involving complicated proteins and genetic measurements. 
Result and Implications. However, when using the PCA method to reduce the 
features, the detection accuracy dropped to 89.9%. IG-ANFIS gave us detection 
accuracy (98.24%) by reducing the number of variables using the "information 
gain" method. While the ANFIS algorithm had a detection accuracy of 59.9% 
without utilizing features, J48, which is one of the decision tree approaches, 
had a detection accuracy of 92.86% without using features extraction methods. 
When applying PCA techniques to minimize features, the detection accuracy was 
lowered to the same way (91.1%) as the Naive Bayes detection algorithm (96.4%).

Objective: This study aimed to prove the concept of a new optical video-based 
system to measure Parkinson's disease (PD) remotely using an accessible standard 
webcam. Methods: We consecutively enrolled a cohort of 42 patients with PD and 
healthy subjects (HSs). The participants were recorded performing MDS-UPDRS III 
bradykinesia upper limb tasks with a computer webcam. The video frames were 
processed using the artificial intelligence algorithms tracking the movements of 
the hands. The video extracted features were correlated with clinical rating 
using the Movement Disorder Society revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease 
Rating Scale and inertial measurement units (IMUs). The developed classifiers 
were validated on an independent dataset. Results: We found significant 
differences in the motor performance of the patients with PD and HSs in all the 
bradykinesia upper limb motor tasks. The best performing classifiers were 
unilateral finger tapping and hand movement speed. The model correlated both 
with the IMUs for quantitative assessment of motor function and the clinical 
scales, hence demonstrating concurrent validity with the existing methods. 
Conclusions: We present here the proof-of-concept of a novel webcam-based 
technology to remotely detect the parkinsonian features using artificial 
intelligence. This method has preliminarily achieved a very high diagnostic 
accuracy and could be easily expanded to other disease manifestations to support 
PD management.

The purpose of this research is to examine the mediating role of emotional 
intelligence in the relationship between school principals' sustainable 
leadership behaviors and their diversity management skills. For this purpose, 
this research, which was designed in the relational survey model, was carried 
out on teachers. The data of the study were collected using the "Sustainable 
Leadership Scale," "Diversity Management Scale," and "Emotional Intelligence 
Scale." Descriptive statistics, Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, 
t-test, one-way ANOVA analyses and structural equation model were used in the 
analysis of the data. As a result of the research, it was found that the school 
principals' sustainable leadership behavior levels, their ability to manage 
differences and their emotional intelligence levels were high according to 
teacher perceptions. According to the correlation analysis, it was found that 
there is a positive and significant relationship between sustainable leadership, 
diversity management, and emotional intelligence. In addition, path analyses to 
examine the mediator variable effect revealed that emotional intelligence has a 
full mediating role in the relationship between school principals' sustainable 
leadership behaviors and their diversity management skills. In addition to the 
research, it was also examined whether teachers perceptions of school principals 
on sustainable leadership behaviors, diversity management skills, and emotional 
intelligence levels differ significantly according to teachers' gender, 
professional seniority, educational status and the level of education they work 
in. In addition to this, they have shown that they need to use their emotional 
intelligence effectively.

The objective of the study is to explore an effective way for providing students 
with the appropriate learning resources in the remote education scenario. 
Artificial intelligence (AI) technology and educational psychology theory are 
applied for designing a personalized online learning resource recommendation 
scheme to improve students' learning outcomes. First, according to educational 
psychology, students' learning ability can be obtained by analyzing their 
learning behaviors. Their identities can be classified into three main groups. 
Then, features of learning resources such as difficulty degree are extracted, 
and a LinUCB-based learning resource recommendation algorithm is proposed. In 
this algorithm, a personalized exploration coefficient is carefully constructed 
according to student's ability and attention scores. It can adaptively adjust 
the ratio of exploration and exploitation during recommendation. Finally, 
experiments are conducted for evaluating the superior performance of the 
proposed scheme. The experimental results show that the proposed recommendation 
scheme can find appropriate learning resources which will match the student's 
ability and satisfy the student's personalized demands. Meanwhile, by comparing 
with existing state-of-the-art recommendation schemes, the proposed scheme can 
achieve accurate recommendations, so as to provide students with the most 
suitable online learning resources and reduce the risk brought by exploration. 
Therefore, the proposed scheme can not only control the difficulty degree of 
learning resources within the student's ability but also encourage their 
potential by providing suitable learning resources.

Introduction: Emotion recognition of voices may play an important role in 
interpersonal communication and patients with schizophrenia present alterations 
in this regard. Several on-line rehabilitation tools have been developed for 
treatment in this area. Voices is an on-line prosodic recognition program 
consisting of identifying different emotional tones in neutral phrases, in 
different sessions of gradually increasing difficulty. This training tool has 
previously reported benefits, and a new version has been created called Voices 
2. The main aim of this study is to test the capacity of the Voices 2 program to 
improve emotion recognition through prosody for adults with schizophrenia. 
Secondly, it seeks to observe durability effects 1 month after intervention. 
Method: A randomized, single-blind, multicenter clinical trial was conducted 
with 44 outpatients diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. 
The intervention group (also called Voices) was treated with Voices 2, whereas 
the control group was treated with auditory training that was not related to 
emotions. Sociodemographic and clinical data, clinical state (PANSS), 
Intelligence Quotient and prosodic recognition (RMV-SV) were measured at 
baseline. After intervention, RMV-SV and PANSS were assessed. One month later, 
the RMV-SV measure was repeated. Results: The control group (n = 19) and the 
Voices group (n = 22) did not differ on χ2, t or U tests in sociodemographic, 
clinical and psychometric variables at baseline or post-intervention (all 
p-values > 0.05). In the Voices group, statistically significant differences 
were observed in the RMV-SV scale applied post-intervention vs. that applied 
pre-intervention (Z = 2.47, p = 0.013). Similar results were observed in the 
1-month follow-up RMV-SV vs. the pre-intervention RMV-SV (Z = 1.97, p = 0.049). 
PANSS scale was also assessed with no significant differences between pre vs. 
post measures in both groups. Lastly, Voices 2 was rated relatively higher, 
based on its ease of understanding, entertainment value, usefulness and the 
appropriateness of use of its emotional glossary. Discussion: Improvements were 
observed in prosodic recognition following intervention with Voices 2 in the 
Voices group. Although these results are similar to other clinical trial 
rehabilitation programs, specific research on the matter remains scarce. Certain 
aspects, such as the durability of effects or adherence should be thoroughly 
studied and clarified. Clinical Trial Registration:

Affective computing (also referred to as artificial emotion intelligence or 
emotion AI) is the study and development of systems and devices that can 
recognize, interpret, process, and simulate emotion or other affective 
phenomena. With the rapid growth in the aging population around the world, 
affective computing has immense potential to benefit the treatment and care of 
late-life mood and cognitive disorders. For late-life depression, affective 
computing ranging from vocal biomarkers to facial expressions to social media 
behavioral analysis can be used to address inadequacies of current screening and 
diagnostic approaches, mitigate loneliness and isolation, provide more 
personalized treatment approaches, and detect risk of suicide. Similarly, for 
Alzheimer's disease, eye movement analysis, vocal biomarkers, and driving and 
behavior can provide objective biomarkers for early identification and 
monitoring, allow more comprehensive understanding of daily life and disease 
fluctuations, and facilitate an understanding of behavioral and psychological 
symptoms such as agitation. To optimize the utility of affective computing while 
mitigating potential risks and ensure responsible development, ethical 
development of affective computing applications for late-life mood and cognitive 
disorders is needed.

Background: Agarwood, a type of herbal medicine widely used in Asian countries, 
is noted in traditional medicine for its intelligence-enhancing effects. 
Agarwood incense is traditionally administered by oral and nasal inhalation. To 
verify whether agarwood incense can exert its intelligence-enhancing effects in 
this way to rescue learning and memory impairment, typical clinical 
manifestations of dementia, we conducted a set of behavioral tests related to 
learning and memory. Methods: C57BL/6 mice were divided into six groups. In 
addition to the control and model groups, we added a donepezil treatment group 
to evaluate the effect of three different agarwood administration doses. After a 
week of administration, scopolamine was injected 30 min before each behavioral 
test to create a learning and memory impairment model. A series of behavioral 
tests [the Morris water maze test (MWM), the novel object recognition test 
(NOR), and the step-down test (SDT)] were used to assess their learning ability, 
as well as their spatial and recognition memory. Results: After scopolamine 
injection, the model group showed significant learning and memory impairment 
(i.e., longer latencies, lower crossing times, and lesser distance travelled in 
the target quadrant in MWM; a lower recognition index in NOR; and longer 
latencies and higher error times in SDT). The other four treatment groups all 
showed improvements in these indicators, and the overall therapeutic effect of 
agarwood was superior. Conclusion: The inhalation administration of agarwood can 
significantly improve the learning and memory impairment caused by scopolamine 
in mice, and the therapeutic effect varied between doses.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), an autoimmune disease of unknown etiology, is a 
serious threat to the health of middle-aged and elderly people. Although western 
medicine, traditional medicine such as traditional Chinese medicine, Tibetan 
medicine and other ethnic medicine have shown certain advantages in the 
diagnosis and treatment of RA, there are still some practical shortcomings, such 
as delayed diagnosis, improper treatment scheme and unclear drug mechanism. At 
present, the applications of artificial intelligence (AI)-based deep learning 
and cloud computing has aroused wide attention in the medical and health field, 
especially in screening potential active ingredients, targets and action 
pathways of single drugs or prescriptions in traditional medicine and optimizing 
disease diagnosis and treatment models. Integrated information and analysis of 
RA patients based on AI and medical big data will unquestionably benefit more RA 
patients worldwide. In this review, we mainly elaborated the application status 
and prospect of AI-assisted deep learning and cloud computation-oriented western 
medicine and traditional medicine on the diagnosis and treatment of RA in 
different stages. It can be predicted that with the help of AI, more 
pharmacological mechanisms of effective ethnic drugs against RA will be 
elucidated and more accurate solutions will be provided for the treatment and 
diagnosis of RA in the future.

Perth, Western Australia, Australia 6150.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the prevalence of 5 
chiropractic-specific terms on UK chiropractic websites to findings in a 
previous study in Australia and to provide an argument against the use of these 
terms.
METHODS: We searched websites belonging to chiropractors registered with the 
General Chiropractic Council for 5 terms: subluxation, vital(-ism/-istic), 
wellness, adjust(-ing/-ment), and Innate (Intelligence). Of 3239 websites, 326 
were sampled. Each page was searched, and terms were counted only if used in a 
chiropractic-specific context. Term occurrence and frequency were recorded. The 
data were analyzed using a single-sample χ2 goodness-of-fit test for unequal 
proportions. The results were compared to those of our prior Australian study, 
using the χ2 test of homogeneity to determine the differences between samples.
RESULTS: At least 1 of the 5 chiropractic-specific terms was found on 245 (75%) 
of UK websites. Adjust(-ing/-ment) was found on 222 (68%) of UK websites 
compared to 283 (77%) in Australia; wellness on 67 (5%) of UK sites compared to 
199 (33%) in Australia; vital(-ism/-istic) on 30 (9%) of UK sites compared to 71 
(19%) in Australia; subluxation on 17 (5%) of UK sites compared to 104 (28%) in 
Australia; and Innate on 10 (3%) of UK sites compared to 39 (11%) in Australia. 
A χ2 test found that the terms were not equally distributed in the two samples, 
χ42  = 404.080, P < .001. In the discussion, we explain why we feel that 
chiropractic-specific terms should be abandoned and standard biomedical terms 
used.
CONCLUSION: In the sample of websites we evaluated in this study, the majority 
in the United Kingdom used the 5 chiropractic-specific terms that we searched 
for. The terms were used less frequently than on websites in Australia but were 
in a similar order of prevalence.

With the development of telemedicine and edge computing, edge artificial 
intelligence (AI) will become a new development trend for smart medicine. On the 
other hand, nearly one-third of children suffer from sleep disorders. However, 
all existing sleep staging methods are for adults. Therefore, we adapted edge AI 
to develop a lightweight automatic sleep staging method for children using 
single-channel EEG. The trained sleep staging model will be deployed to edge 
smart devices so that the sleep staging can be implemented on edge devices which 
will greatly save network resources and improving the performance and privacy of 
sleep staging application. Then the results and hypnogram will be uploaded to 
the cloud server for further analysis by the physicians to get sleep disease 
diagnosis reports and treatment opinions. We utilized 1D convolutional neural 
networks (1D-CNN) and long short term memory (LSTM) to build our sleep staging 
model, named CSleepNet. We tested the model on our childrens sleep (CS) dataset 
and sleep-EDFX dataset. For the CS dataset, we experimented with F4-M1 channel 
EEG using four different loss functions, and the logcosh performed best with 
overall accuracy of 83.06% and F1-score of 76.50%. We used Fpz-Cz and Pz-Oz 
channel EEG to train our model in Sleep-EDFX dataset, and achieved an accuracy 
of 86.41% without manual feature extraction. The experimental results show that 
our method has great potential. It not only plays an important role in 
sleep-related research, but also can be widely used in the classification of 
other time sequences physiological signals.

PURPOSE: Business competition is getting more intense nowadays, and corporate 
survival is getting harder; consequently, corporate managers have to make 
financial decisions in complex and globalized scenarios. As a result, in order 
to compete in today's global economy, businesses are contemplating incorporating 
behavioural components of human psychology into their decision-making processes. 
Corporations are masters of quantitative analysis, but they rarely pay attention 
to behavioural elements of organizational success. Emotional intelligence is 
important in many parts of life; therefore, it is crucial to look at its 
dimensions when it comes to corporate financial decision-making.
METHODS: A simple random sampling technique was used to collect data from 200 
senior-level managers from the corporate sector located in the twin cities of 
Rawalpindi and Islamabad of Pakistan. SPSS version 22 was used to test the 
hypotheses.
RESULTS: Results of the study show the gender-based variation in corporate 
financial decision-making detailing the higher impact of EI of males on CFD than 
their counterparts in the corporate sector organizations. The elements of 
self-awareness, empathy, motivation and self-regulation affect the financial 
decision-making of both the genders with varying degrees of influence, whereas 
social skills do not affect CFD of both genders.
CONCLUSION: The study findings explicate that the influence of self-awareness 
and empathy constructs of EI on corporate financial decisions is stronger in 
female managers than their male counterparts. However, male managers exhibit a 
significantly stronger influence of motivation, social skills, and 
self-regulation dimensions on their financial decisions compared to female 
managers in a corporate setting. Overall, the impact of EI on CFD is slightly 
higher in male managers. These empirical outcomes imply that organizations 
should assess the employees not only for technical skills but also based on 
their emotional intelligence during the recruitment process.

BACKGROUND: Even children with extensive perinatal left-sided lesions have been 
reported to show normal language functions based on right-hemispheric language 
reorganization. This reorganization can lead to deficits in originary right 
hemispheric functions ("crowding hypothesis"). In a previous study, however, we 
identified epilepsy (even when well-controlled), and not language 
reorganization, as the major risk factor for impaired nonverbal functions. Here, 
we asked whether verbal and nonverbal functions develop differently, and whether 
they share the same risk factors.
METHODS: We investigated 23 patients (11f, Md = 12.56 years) with perinatal 
strokes (16 left-sided, 8 with epilepsy), and 23 healthy age-matched controls (8 
f, Md = 12.42years). Language functions were assessed using the Potsdam Illinois 
Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities, nonverbal intelligence with the Test of 
Nonverbal Intelligence, language lateralization with functional MRI, and lesion 
size with MRI-based volumetry.
RESULTS: We found no systematic difference between verbal and nonverbal skills 
in our patients or controls [median difference Z(PITPA)-Z(TONI): 
patients = -0.03, controls = -0.06]. Accordingly, verbal and nonverbal functions 
were strongly correlated in patients (r = 0.80) and in controls (r = 0.74). 
Language ability correlated significantly with epilepsy. Furthermore, in 
patients with epilepsies, verbal skills were significantly lower than in 
controls.
CONCLUSION: In our cohort, we found no evidence for a differential effect of 
perinatal strokes on the development of verbal versus nonverbal functions, and, 
specifically, no evidence for a preferential sparing of verbal functions. 
Epilepsy, even when well-controlled, was confirmed as a single key risk factor 
for verbal functions.

BACKGROUND: We designed an algorithm to assess COVID-19 patients severity and 
dynamic intubation needs and predict their length of stay using the breathing 
frequency (BF) and oxygen saturation (SpO2) signals.
METHODS: We recorded the BF and SpO2 signals for confirmed COVID-19 patients 
admitted to the ICU of a teaching hospital during both the first and subsequent 
outbreaks of the pandemic in France. An unsupervised machine-learning algorithm 
(the Gaussian mixture model) was applied to the patients' data for clustering. 
The algorithm's robustness was ensured by comparing its results against actual 
intubation rates. We predicted intubation rates using the algorithm every hour, 
thus conducting a severity evaluation. We designed a S24 severity score that 
represented the patient's severity over the previous 24 h; the validity of MS24, 
the maximum S24 score, was checked against rates of intubation risk and 
prolonged ICU stay.
RESULTS: Our sample included 279 patients. . The unsupervised clustering had an 
accuracy rate of 87.8% for intubation recognition (AUC = 0.94, True Positive 
Rate 86.5%, true Negative Rate 90.9%). The S24 score of intubated patients was 
significantly higher than that of non-intubated patients at 48 h before 
intubation. The MS24 score allowed for the distinguishing between three severity 
levels with an increased risk of intubation: green (3.4%), orange (37%), and red 
(77%). A MS24 score over 40 was highly predictive of an ICU stay greater than 5 
days at an accuracy rate of 81.0% (AUC = 0.87).
CONCLUSIONS: Our algorithm uses simple signals and seems to efficiently 
visualize the patients' respiratory situations, meaning that it has the 
potential to assist staffs' in decision-making. Additionally, real-time 
computation is easy to implement.

We studied the possibility of using artificial intelligence (AI) passive 
microwave radiometry (MWR) for the diagnostics of venous diseases. MWR measures 
non-invasive microwave emission (internal temperature) from human body 4 cm 
deep. The method has been used for early diagnostics in cancer, back pain, 
brain, COVID-19 pneumonia, and other diseases. In this paper, an AI model based 
on MWR data is proposed. The model was used to predict the disease state of 
phlebology patients. We have used MWR and infrared (skin temperature) data of 
the lower extremities to design a feature space and construct a classification 
algorithm. Our method has a sensitivity above 0.8 and a specificity above 0.7. 
At the same time, our method provides an advisory outcome in terms which are 
understandable for clinicians.

Most national health-care systems approve new drugs based on data of safety and 
efficacy from large randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Strict selection biases 
and study-entry criteria of subjects included in RCTs often do not reflect those 
of the population where a therapy is intended to be used. Compliance to 
treatment in RCTs also differs considerably from real world settings and the 
relatively small size of most RCTs make them unlikely to detect rare but 
important safety signals. These and other considerations may explain the gap 
between evidence generated in RCTs and translating conclusions to health-care 
policies in the real world. Real-world evidence (RWE) derived from real-world 
data (RWD) is receiving increasing attention from scientists, clinicians, and 
health-care policy decision-makers - especially when it is processed by 
artificial intelligence (AI). We describe the potential of using RWD and AI in 
Hematology to support research and health-care decisions.

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is an important cause of blindness globally, and its 
prevalence is increasing. Early detection and intervention can help change the 
outcomes of the disease. The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) 
in recent years has led to new possibilities for the screening and diagnosis of 
DR. An AI-based diagnostic system for the detection of DR has significant 
advantages, such as high efficiency, high accuracy, and lower demand for human 
resources. At the same time, there are shortcomings, such as the lack of 
standards for development and evaluation and the limited scope of application. 
This article demonstrates the current applications of AI in the field of DR, 
existing problems, and possible future development directions.

AIMS: Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of death. Early intervention is the 
key to reduce HF-related morbidity and mortality. This study assesses the 
utility of electrocardiograms (ECGs) in HF risk prediction.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Data from the baseline visits (1987-89) of the 
Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study was used. Incident hospitalized 
HF events were ascertained by ICD codes. Participants with good quality baseline 
ECGs were included. Participants with prevalent HF were excluded. ECG-artificial 
intelligence (AI) model to predict HF was created as a deep residual 
convolutional neural network (CNN) utilizing standard 12-lead ECG. The area 
under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to evaluate 
prediction models including (CNN), light gradient boosting machines (LGBM), and 
Cox proportional hazards regression. A total of 14 613 (45% male, 73% of white, 
mean age ± standard deviation of 54 ± 5) participants were eligible. A total of 
803 (5.5%) participants developed HF within 10 years from baseline. 
Convolutional neural network utilizing solely ECG achieved an AUC of 0.756 
(0.717-0.795) on the hold-out test data. ARIC and Framingham Heart Study (FHS) 
HF risk calculators yielded AUC of 0.802 (0.750-0.850) and 0.780 (0.740-0.830). 
The highest AUC of 0.818 (0.778-0.859) was obtained when ECG-AI model output, 
age, gender, race, body mass index, smoking status, prevalent coronary heart 
disease, diabetes mellitus, systolic blood pressure, and heart rate were used as 
predictors of HF within LGBM. The ECG-AI model output was the most important 
predictor of HF.
CONCLUSIONS: ECG-AI model based solely on information extracted from ECG 
independently predicts HF with accuracy comparable to existing FHS and ARIC risk 
calculators.

AIMS: Cardiovascular disease is a major threat to maternal health, with 
cardiomyopathy being among the most common acquired cardiovascular diseases 
during pregnancy and the postpartum period. The aim of our study was to evaluate 
the effectiveness of an electrocardiogram (ECG)-based deep learning model in 
identifying cardiomyopathy during pregnancy and the postpartum period.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We used an ECG-based deep learning model to detect 
cardiomyopathy in a cohort of women who were pregnant or in the postpartum 
period seen at Mayo Clinic. Model performance was evaluated using the area under 
the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and 
specificity. We compared the diagnostic probabilities of the deep learning model 
with natriuretic peptides and a multivariable model consisting of demographic 
and clinical parameters. The study cohort included 1807 women; 7%, 10%, and 13% 
had left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 35% or less, <45%, and <50%, 
respectively. The ECG-based deep learning model identified cardiomyopathy with 
AUCs of 0.92 (LVEF ≤ 35%), 0.89 (LVEF < 45%), and 0.87 (LVEF < 50%). For LVEF of 
35% or less, AUC was higher in Black (0.95) and Hispanic (0.98) women compared 
to White (0.91). Natriuretic peptides and the multivariable model had AUCs of 
0.85 to 0.86 and 0.72, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: An ECG-based deep learning model effectively identifies 
cardiomyopathy during pregnancy and the postpartum period and outperforms 
natriuretic peptides and traditional clinical parameters with the potential to 
become a powerful initial screening tool for cardiomyopathy in the obstetric 
care setting.

Dilated Cardiomyopathy is conventionally defined by left ventricular dilatation 
and dysfunction in the absence of coronary disease. Emerging evidence suggests 
many patients remain vulnerable to major adverse outcomes despite clear 
therapeutic success of modern evidence-based heart failure therapy. In this era 
of personalized medical care, the conventional assessment of left ventricular 
ejection fraction falls short in fully predicting evolution and risk of outcomes 
in this heterogenous group of heart muscle disease, as such, a more refined 
means of phenotyping this disease appears essential. Cardiac MRI (CMR) is 
well-placed in this respect, not only for its diagnostic utility, but the wealth 
of information captured in global and regional function assessment with the 
addition of unique tissue characterization across different disease states and 
patient cohorts. Advanced tools are needed to leverage these sensitive metrics 
and integrate with clinical, genetic and biochemical information for 
personalized, and more clinically useful characterization of the dilated 
cardiomyopathy phenotype. Recent advances in artificial intelligence offers the 
unique opportunity to impact clinical decision making through enhanced precision 
image-analysis tasks, multi-source extraction of relevant features and seamless 
integration to enhance understanding, improve diagnosis, and subsequently 
clinical outcomes. Focusing particularly on deep learning, a subfield of 
artificial intelligence, that has garnered significant interest in the imaging 
community, this paper reviews the main developments that could offer more robust 
disease characterization and risk stratification in the Dilated Cardiomyopathy 
phenotype. Given its promising utility in the non-invasive assessment of cardiac 
diseases, we firstly highlight the key applications in CMR, set to enable 
comprehensive quantitative measures of function beyond the standard of care 
assessment. Concurrently, we revisit the added value of tissue characterization 
techniques for risk stratification, showcasing the deep learning platforms that 
overcome limitations in current clinical workflows and discuss how they could be 
utilized to better differentiate at-risk subgroups of this phenotype. The final 
section of this paper is dedicated to the allied clinical applications to 
imaging, that incorporate artificial intelligence and have harnessed the 
comprehensive abundance of data from genetics and relevant clinical variables to 
facilitate better classification and enable enhanced risk prediction for 
relevant outcomes.

It has become an inevitable trend for medical personnel to analyze and diagnose 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) in different stages by combining functional magnetic 
resonance imaging (fMRI) and artificial intelligence technologies such as deep 
learning in the future. In this paper, a classification method was proposed for 
AD based on two different transformation images of fMRI and improved the 
3DPCANet model and canonical correlation analysis (CCA). The main ideas include 
that, firstly, fMRI images were preprocessed, and subsequently, mean regional 
homogeneity (mReHo) and mean amplitude of low-frequency amplitude (mALFF) 
transformation were performed for the preprocessed images. Then, mReHo and mALFF 
images were extracted features using the improved 3DPCANet, and these two kinds 
of the extracted features were fused by CCA. Finally, the support vector machine 
(SVM) was used to classify AD patients with different stages. Experimental 
results showed that the proposed approach was robust and effective. 
Classification accuracy for significant memory concern (SMC) vs. mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI), normal control (NC) vs. AD, and NC vs. SMC, respectively, 
reached 95.00%, 92.00%, and 91.30%, which adequately proved the feasibility and 
effectiveness of the proposed method.

In order to improve software quality and testing efficiency, this paper 
implements the prediction of software defects based on deep learning. According 
to the respective advantages and disadvantages of the particle swarm algorithm 
and the wolf swarm algorithm, the two algorithms are mixed to realize the 
complementary advantages of the algorithms. At the same time, the hybrid 
algorithm is used in the search of model hyperparameter optimization, the loss 
function of the model is used as the fitness function, and the collaborative 
search ability of the swarm intelligence population is used to find the global 
optimal solution in multiple local solution spaces. Through the analysis of the 
experimental results of six data sets, compared with the traditional 
hyperparameter optimization method and a single swarm intelligence algorithm, 
the model using the hybrid algorithm has higher and better indicators. And, 
under the processing of the autoencoder, the performance of the model has been 
further improved.

Infliximab (IFX) is an effective medication for ulcerative colitis (UC) 
patients. However, one-third of UC patients show primary non-response (PNR) to 
IFX. Our study analyzed three Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets and used 
the RobustRankAggreg (RRA) algorithm to assist in identifying differentially 
expressed genes (DEGs) between IFX responders and non-responders. Then, an 
artificial intelligence (AI) technology, artificial neural network (ANN) 
analysis, was applied to validate the predictive value of the selected genes. 
The results showed that the combination of CDX2, CHP2, HSD11B2, RANK, NOX4, and 
VDR is a good predictor of patients' response to IFX therapy. The range of 
repeated overall area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) 
was 0.850 ± 0.103. Moreover, we used an independent GEO dataset to further 
verify the value of the six DEGs in predicting PNR to IFX, which has a range of 
overall AUC of 0.759 ± 0.065. Since protein detection did not require fresh 
tissue and can avoid multiple biopsies, our study tried to discover whether the 
key information, analyzed by RNA levels, is suitable for protein detection. 
Therefore, immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of colonic biopsy tissues from UC 
patients treated with IFX and a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis 
were used to further explore the clinical application value of the six DEGs at 
the protein level. The IHC staining of colon tissues from UC patients confirmed 
that VDR and RANK are significantly associated with IFX efficacy. Total IHC 
scores lower than 5 for VDR and lower than 7 for RANK had an AUC of 0.828 (95% 
CI: 0.665-0.991, p = 0.013) in predicting PNR to IFX. Collectively, we 
identified a predictive RNA model for PNR to IFX and explored an immune-related 
protein model based on the RNA model, including VDR and RANK, as a predictor of 
IFX non-response, and determined the cutoff value. The result showed a 
connection between the RNA and protein model, and both two models were 
available. However, the composite signature of VDR and RANK is more conducive to 
clinical application, which could be used to guide the preselection of patients 
who might benefit from pharmacological treatment in the future.

Superconducting electronics (SCE) is uniquely suited to implement neuromorphic 
systems. As a result, SCE has the potential to enable a new generation of 
neuromorphic architectures that can simultaneously provide scalability, 
programmability, biological fidelity, on-line learning support, efficiency and 
speed. Supporting all of these capabilities simultaneously has thus far proven 
to be difficult using existing semiconductor technologies. However, as the 
fields of computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) continue 
to advance, the need for architectures that can provide combinations of these 
capabilities will grow. In this paper, we will explain how superconducting 
electronics could be used to address this need by combining analog and digital 
SCE circuits to build large scale neuromorphic systems. In particular, we will 
show through detailed analysis that the available SCE technology is suitable for 
near term neuromorphic demonstrations. Furthermore, this analysis will establish 
that neuromorphic architectures built using SCE will have the potential to be 
significantly faster and more efficient than current approaches, all while 
supporting capabilities such as biologically suggestive neuron models and 
on-line learning. In the future, SCE-based neuromorphic systems could serve as 
experimental platforms supporting investigations that are not feasible with 
current approaches. Ultimately, these systems and the experiments that they 
support would enable the advancement of neuroscience and the development of more 
sophisticated AI.

Radiomics is a newcomer field that has opened new windows for precision 
medicine. It is related to extraction of a large number of quantitative features 
from medical images, which may be difficult to detect visually. Underlying tumor 
biology can change physical properties of tissues, which affect patterns of 
image pixels and radiomics features. The main advantage of radiomics is that it 
can characterize the whole tumor non-invasively, even after a single sampling 
from an image. Therefore, it can be linked to a "digital biopsy". Physicians 
need to know about radiomics features to determine how their values correlate 
with the appearance of lesions and diseases. Indeed, physicians need practical 
references to conceive of basics and concepts of each radiomics feature without 
knowing their sophisticated mathematical formulas. In this review, commonly used 
radiomics features are illustrated with practical examples to help physicians in 
their routine diagnostic procedures.

Lanka. Electronic address: baminiwatta@kln.ac.lk.

This bibliometric analysis aimed to identify active research areas and trends in 
machine learning applications within the psychiatric literature. An exponential 
growth in the number of related publications indexed in Web of Science during 
the last decade was noted. Document co-citation analysis revealed 10 clusters of 
knowledge, which included several mental health conditions, albeit with visible 
structural overlap. Several influential publications in the co-citation network 
were identified. Keyword trends illustrated a recent shift of focus from 
"psychotic" to "neurotic" conditions. Despite a relative lack of literature from 
the developing world, a recent rise in publications from Asian countries was 
observed. DATA AVAILABILITY: Bibliographic data for this study were downloaded 
from the Web of Science. The search strategy is included in the Supplementary 
file.

Owing to the natural abundance, easy availability, high stability, 
non-stoichiometry, and chemical diversity, considerable interest has been 
devoted to tungsten oxide (WO3-x) nanomaterials, and many advances have been 
achieved ranging from traditional catalysts and electronics to emerging 
artificial intelligence. This review focuses on recent progress of WO3-x 
polymorphs and their multifunctional applications. The structural diversity and 
crystal phase transitions of WO3-x and recent advances on the general synthesis 
of various WO3-x nanostructures are first summarized, since the crystal 
structure and morphology adjustment obviously affect the physiochemical merits 
of WO3-x materials. Then, their applications and related mechanisms in different 
fields are demonstrated, such as gas sensing, chromogenic (electro-, photo-, 
gaso-, and thermochromic), photocatalytic (pollutant degradation and water 
splitting), and emerging applications (biomedical, antibiotic, and artificial 
intelligence). With the advances highlighted here and the ongoing research 
efforts, the continuous breakthrough in functionalized WO3-x nanostructure and 
their attractive applications is foreseeable in the future.

How to influence positive change? Managers' involvement as emotional architects 
in the solution for relieving forensic examiners' workplace stress.

Harper DS(1).

States.

This article responds to emerging research findings; forensic examiners are 
stressed in the workplace by their leaders who push them to improve performance 
to meet deadlines. Pushing employees causing them moderate stress was an 
acceptable practice to enhance performance while maintaining motivation. This is 
not true today! The same factors contributing to the stress of forensic 
examiners can decrease their stress, and this can be championed by managing 
employees' emotions. The skill and ability are critical for leaders to have, and 
these would assist leaders with effectively moving employees along the work 
continuum. In this opinion piece, I add to a lack of research regarding 
identification and to the understanding of the skills and abilities used during 
interpersonal regulation. I introduce the Emotion Regulation Skills-Abilities 
model (ERSA) developed, empirically grounded, and supported by current 
theoretical models. I demonstrate how focusing on developing supervisors' skills 
and abilities improve the workplace with practicing these skills. Leaders are 
the emotional architects who could positively assure a less stressful 
environment based on these efforts of being effective managers of other people's 
emotion.

Radiomics has achieved significant momentum in radiology research and can reveal 
image information invisible to radiologists' eyes. Radiomics first evolved for 
oncologic imaging. Oncologic applications (histopathology, tumor grading, gene 
mutation analysis, patient survival, and treatment response prediction) of 
radiomics are widespread. However, it is not limited to oncologic analysis, and 
any digital medical images can benefit from radiomics analysis. This article 
reviews the current literature on radiomics in non-oncologic, neurological 
disorders including ischemic strokes, hemorrhagic stroke, cerebral aneurysms, 
and demyelinating disorders.

The present study created an artificial intelligence (AI)-automated diagnostics 
system for uterine cervical lesions and assessed the performance of these images 
for AI diagnostic imaging of pathological cervical lesions. A total of 463 
colposcopic images were analyzed. The traditional colposcopy diagnoses were 
compared to those obtained by AI image diagnosis. Next, 100 images were 
presented to a panel of 32 gynecologists who independently examined each image 
in a blinded fashion and diagnosed them for four categories of tumors. Then, the 
32 gynecologists revisited their diagnosis for each image after being informed 
of the AI diagnosis. The present study assessed any changes in physician 
diagnosis and the accuracy of AI-image-assisted diagnosis (AISD). The accuracy 
of AI was 57.8% for normal, 35.4% for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)1, 
40.5% for CIN2-3 and 44.2% for invasive cancer. The accuracy of gynecologist 
diagnoses from cervical pathological images, before knowing the AI image 
diagnosis, was 54.4% for CIN2-3 and 38.9% for invasive cancer. After learning of 
the AISD, their accuracy improved to 58.0% for CIN2-3 and 48.5% for invasive 
cancer. AI-assisted image diagnosis was able to improve gynecologist diagnosis 
accuracy significantly (P<0.01) for invasive cancer and tended to improve their 
accuracy for CIN2-3 (P=0.14).

The extent of removal of the uremic toxins in hemodialysis (HD) therapies 
depends primarily on the dialysis membrane characteristics and the solute 
transport mechanisms involved. While designation of 'flux' of membranes as well 
toxicity of compounds that need to be targeted for removal remain unresolved 
issues, the relative role, efficiency and utilization of solute removal 
principles to optimize HD treatment are better delineated. Through the 
combination and intensity of diffusive and convective removal forces, levels of 
concentrations of a broad spectrum of uremic toxins can be lowered significantly 
and successfully. Extended clinical experience as well as data from several 
clinical trials attest to the benefits of convection-based HD treatment 
modalities. However, the mode of delivery of HD can further enhance the 
effectiveness of therapies. Other than treatment time, frequency and location 
that offer clinical benefits and increase patient well-being, treatment- and 
patient-specific criteria may be tailored for the therapy delivered: 
electrolytic composition, dialysate buffer and concentration and choice of 
anticoagulating agent are crucial for dialysis tolerance and efficacy. 
Evidence-based medicine (EBM) relies on three tenets, i.e. clinical expertise 
(i.e. doctor), patient-centered values (i.e. patient) and relevant scientific 
evidence (i.e. science), that have deviated from their initial aim and 
summarized to scientific evidence, leading to tyranny of randomized controlled 
trials. One must recognize that practice patterns as shown by Dialysis Outcomes 
and Practice Patterns Study and personalization of HD care are the main driving 
force for improving outcomes. Based on a combination of the three pillars of 
EBM, and particularly on bedside patient-clinician interaction, we summarize 
what we have learned over the last 6 decades in terms of best practices to 
improve outcomes in HD patients. Management of initiation of dialysis, vascular 
access, preservation of kidney function, selection of biocompatible dialysers 
and use of dialysis fluids of high microbiological purity to restrict 
inflammation are just some of the approaches where clinical experience is vital 
in the absence of definitive scientific evidence. Further, HD adequacy needs to 
be considered as a broad and multitarget approach covering not just the dose of 
dialysis provided, but meeting individual patient needs (e.g. fluid volume, 
acid-base, blood pressure, bone disease metabolism control) through regular 
assessment-and adjustment-of a series of indicators of treatment efficiency. 
Finally, in whichever way new technologies (i.e. artificial intelligence, 
connected health) are embraced in the future to improve the delivery of 
dialysis, the human dimension of the patient-doctor interaction is 
irreplaceable. Kidney medicine should remain 'an art' and will never be just 'a 
science'.

BACKGROUND: The global prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) 
continues to rise. Non-invasive diagnostic modalities including ultrasonography 
and clinical scoring systems have been proposed as alternatives to liver biopsy 
but with limited performance. Artificial intelligence (AI) is currently being 
integrated with conventional diagnostic methods in the hopes of performance 
improvements. We aimed to estimate the performance of AI-assisted systems for 
diagnosing NAFLD, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and liver fibrosis.
METHODS: A systematic review was performed to identify studies integrating AI in 
the diagnosis of NAFLD, NASH, and liver fibrosis. Pooled sensitivity, 
specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), 
and summary receiver operating characteristic curves were calculated.
RESULTS: Twenty-five studies were included in the systematic review. 
Meta-analysis of 13 studies showed that AI significantly improved the diagnosis 
of NAFLD, NASH and liver fibrosis. AI-assisted ultrasonography had excellent 
performance for diagnosing NAFLD, with a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV of 
0.97 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.91-0.99), 0.98 (95% CI: 0.89-1.00), 0.98 
(95% CI: 0.93-1.00), and 0.95 (95% CI: 0.88-0.98), respectively. The performance 
of AI-assisted ultrasonography was better than AI-assisted clinical data sets 
for the identification of NAFLD, which provided a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, 
NPV of 0.75 (95% CI: 0.66-0.82), 0.82 (95% CI: 0.74-0.88), 0.75 (95% CI: 
0.60-0.86), and 0.82 (0.74-0.87), respectively. The area under the curves were 
0.98 and 0.85 for AI-assisted ultrasonography and AI-assisted clinical data 
sets, respectively. AI-integrated clinical data sets had a pooled sensitivity, 
specificity of 0.80 (95%CI: 0.75-0.85), 0.69 (95%CI: 0.53-0.82) for identifying 
NASH, as well as 0.99-1.00 and 0.76-1.00 for diagnosing liver fibrosis stage 
F1-F4, respectively.
CONCLUSION: AI-supported systems provide promising performance improvements for 
diagnosing NAFLD, NASH, and identifying liver fibrosis among NAFLD patients. 
Prospective trials with direct comparisons between AI-assisted modalities and 
conventional methods are warranted before real-world implementation.

Crop Agnostic Monitoring Driven by Deep Learning.

Farmers require diverse and complex information to make agronomical decisions 
about crop management including intervention tasks. Generally, this information 
is gathered by farmers traversing their fields or glasshouses which is often a 
time consuming and potentially expensive process. In recent years, robotic 
platforms have gained significant traction due to advances in artificial 
intelligence. However, these platforms are usually tied to one setting (such as 
arable farmland), or algorithms are designed for a single platform. This creates 
a significant gap between available technology and farmer requirements. We 
propose a novel field agnostic monitoring technique that is able to operate on 
two different robots, in arable farmland or a glasshouse (horticultural 
setting). Instance segmentation forms the backbone of this approach from which 
object location and class, object area, and yield information can be obtained. 
In arable farmland, our segmentation network is able to estimate crop and weed 
at a species level and in a glasshouse we are able to estimate the sweet pepper 
and their ripeness. For yield information, we introduce a novel matching 
criterion that removes the pixel-wise constraints of previous versions. This 
approach is able to accurately estimate the number of fruit (sweet pepper) in a 
glasshouse with a normalized absolute error of 4.7% and an R 2 of 0.901 with the 
visual ground truth. When applied to cluttered arable farmland scenes it 
improves on the prior approach by 50%. Finally, a qualitative analysis shows the 
validity of this agnostic monitoring algorithm by supplying decision enabling 
information to the farmer such as the impact of a low level weeding intervention 
scheme.

Pediatric chronic kidney disease (CKD) appears to be a heterogeneous group of 
conditions, but this heterogeneity has not been explored with respect to its 
impact on neurocognitive functioning. This study investigated the neurocognitive 
functioning of those with glomerular (G) vs. non-glomerular (NG) diagnoses. Data 
from the North American CKiD Study were employed and the current study included 
1,003 children and adolescents with mild to moderate CKD. The G Group included 
260 participants (median age = 14.7 years) and the NG Group included 743 
individuals (median age = 9.0 years). Neurocognitive measures assessed IQ, 
inhibitory control, attention regulation, problem solving, working memory, and 
overall executive functioning. Data from all visits were included in the linear 
mixed model analyses. After adjusting for sociodemographic and CKD-related 
covariates, results indicated no differences between the diagnostic groups on 
measures of IQ, problem solving, working memory, and attention regulation. There 
was a trend for the G group to receive better parent ratings on their overall 
executive functions (p < 0.07), with a small effect size being present. 
Additionally, there was a significant G group X hypertension interaction (p < 
0.003) for inhibitory control, indicating that those with both a G diagnosis and 
hypertension performed more poorly than the NG group with hypertension. These 
findings suggest that the separation of G vs. NG CKD produced minimal, but 
specific group differences were observed. Ongoing examination of the 
heterogeneity of pediatric CKD on neurocognition, perhaps at a different time 
point in disease progression or using a different model, appears warranted.

Editorial: State of the Art CT and Image Quality, Radiation and Contrast Dose.

Cavaliere C(1).

Author information:

A special issue of the journal Dose-Response entitled "State of the Art CT and 
Image Quality, Radiation and Contrast Dose" is proposed. Technological 
improvements on CT scanners have the potentiality to reduce the issues related 
to ionizing radiation administration, opening new insights toward innovative 
applications also thanks to the contamination of other research fields like 
artificial intelligence algorithms and additive manufacturing technologies. In 
order to approach these new research directions, a multidisciplinary team 
becomes needed, overcoming the clinical and radiological point of view and 
enriching the workflow with different contributes. The real weight of these 
afferents on patient's management remains to be assessed and characterized. The 
main topics will be related to innovative CT applications able to improve 
patient management and treatment assessment and reduce patients risks due to 
radiation exposure and iodinated contrast injection.

As the demand for laboratory testing by mass spectrometry increases, so does the 
need for automated methods for data analysis. Clinical mass spectrometry (MS) 
data is particularly well-suited for machine learning (ML) methods, which deal 
nicely with structured and discrete data elements. The alignment of these two 
fields offers a promising synergy that can be used to optimize workflows, 
improve result quality, and enhance our understanding of high-dimensional 
datasets and their inherent relationship with disease. In recent years, there 
has been an increasing number of publications that examine the capabilities of 
ML-based software in the context of chromatography and MS. However, given the 
historically distant nature between the fields of clinical chemistry and 
computer science, there is an opportunity to improve technological literacy of 
ML-based software within the clinical laboratory scientist community. To this 
end, we present a basic overview of ML and a tutorial of an ML-based experiment 
using a previously published MS dataset. The purpose of this paper is to 
describe the fundamental principles of supervised ML, outline the steps that are 
classically involved in an ML-based experiment, and discuss the purpose of good 
ML practice in the context of a binary MS classification problem.

OBJECTIVE: Craniofacial defects are functional imbalances of their structures. 
Impaired speech and facial deformities hinder adolescents' ability to fulfill 
social roles. The optimal age for a patient to be qualified for orthognathic 
surgery is between 16 and 30 years.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study sample consisted of 65 patients after 
bimaxillary orthognathic surgery performed in the Head and Neck Surgery 
Department with Craniofacial Surgery Subdivision in Provincial Specialist 
Children's Hospital in Olsztyn. The research tools used in the study were: the 
author's questionnaire concerning sociodemographic data, and the following 
standardized questionnaires: the 'How Do You Cope?' questionnaire, the Emotional 
Intelligence Questionnaire (INTE), the List of Personal Values (LOPV), the Short 
Form Health Survey (SF-36), the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS).
RESULTS: The study demonstrated a positive correlation between the levels of QoL 
and general life satisfaction according to the SWLS. A negative relationship was 
observed between QoL and dispositional coping according to the 'How do you 
cope?' questionnaire. The emotion-focused coping strategy in the category of 
dispositional coping negatively correlated with eight of the SF-36 domains.
CONCLUSIONS: Young adults after bimaxillary orthognathic procedures show a high 
level of QoL. The level of QoL depends, among others, on the level of emotional 
intelligence. Better ability to recognize emotions is associated with higher QoL 
in the domain of general health.

There have been a number of reports about the transcriptional regulatory 
networks in schizophrenia. However, most of these studies were based on a 
specific transcription factor or a single dataset, an approach that is 
inadequate to understand the diverse etiology and underlying common 
characteristics of schizophrenia. Here we reconstructed and compared the 
transcriptional regulatory network for lipid metabolism enzymes using 15 public 
transcriptome datasets of neural cells from schizophrenia patients. Since many 
of the well-known schizophrenia-related SNPs are in enhancers, we reconstructed 
a network including enhancer-dependent regulation and found that 53.3 % of the 
total number of edges (7,577 pairs) involved regulation via enhancers. By 
examining multiple datasets, we found common and unique transcriptional modes of 
regulation. Furthermore, enrichment analysis of SNPs that were connected with 
genes in the transcriptional regulatory networks by eQTL suggested an 
association with hematological cell counts and some other traits/diseases, whose 
relationship to schizophrenia was either not or insufficiently reported in 
previous studies. Based on these results, we suggest that in future studies on 
schizophrenia, information on genotype, comorbidities and hematological cell 
counts should be included, along with the transcriptome, for a more detailed 
genetic stratification and mechanistic exploration of schizophrenia.

The use of machine learning (ML) allows us to automate and scale the 
decision-making processes. The key to this automation is the development of ML 
models that generalize training data toward unseen data. Such models can become 
extremely versatile and powerful, which makes democratization of artificial 
intelligence (AI) possible, that is, providing ML to non-ML experts such as 
software engineers or domain experts. Typically, automated ML (AutoML) is being 
referred to as a key step toward it. However, from our perspective, we believe 
that democratization of the verification process of ML systems is a larger and 
even more crucial challenge to achieve the democratization of AI. Currently, the 
process of ensuring that an ML model works as intended is unstructured. It is 
largely based on experience and domain knowledge that cannot be automated. The 
current approaches such as cross-validation or explainable AI are not enough to 
overcome the real challenges and are discussed extensively in this article. 
Arguing toward structured verification approaches, we discuss a set of 
guidelines to verify models, code, and data in each step of the ML lifecycle. 
These guidelines can help to reliably measure and select an optimal solution, 
besides minimizing the risk of bugs and undesired behavior in edge-cases.

A flexible moderated factor analysis approach to test for measurement invariance 
across a continuous variable.

Molenaar D(1).

Author information:
(1)University of Amsterdam.

Effort has been devoted to the development of moderated factor models in which 
the traditional factor model parameters are allowed to differ across a moderator 
variable. These models are valuable as they enable tests on measurement 
invariance across a continuous background variable. However, moderated factor 
models require the specification of a parametric functional form between the 
factor model parameters and the moderator variable while, in some situations, it 
is unclear what functional form to assume. Therefore, in the present article, a 
semiparametric moderated factor modeling approach is presented in which no 
assumption concerning the functional form between the moderator and the model 
parameters is imposed. In a simulation study, the semiparametric moderated 
factor model is shown to be viable in terms of parameter recovery and the power 
to distinguish the different models for measurement invariance. In addition, the 
model is applied to a real dataset pertaining to intelligence. (PsycInfo

PURPOSE: To develop and internally validate a machine-learning algorithm to 
reliably predict cost after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR).
METHODS: A retrospective review of the New York State Ambulatory Surgery and 
Services database was performed to identify patients who underwent elective ACLR 
from 2015 to 2016. Features included in initial models consisted of patient 
characteristics (age, sex, insurance status, income, medical comorbidities as 
classified by the Clinical Classifications Software diagnosis code) as well as 
intraoperative variables (type of anesthesia and procedure-specific factors). 
Models were generated to predict total charges using 4 algorithms: random 
forest, extreme gradient boost, elastic net penalized regression, and support 
vector machines with radial kernels. Training was performed with 10-fold 
cross-validation followed by internal validation via 0.632 bootstrapping. Model 
discriminative performance was assessed by area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve, calibration, and the Brier score. Decision curve analysis 
was performed to demonstrate the net benefit of using the final model in 
practice.
RESULTS: In total, 7,311 patients undergoing ambulatory ACLR were included. The 
random forest model demonstrated the best performance assessed via internal 
validation (area under the curve = 0.85), calibration, and the Brier score 
(0.208). Cost incurred was influenced by anesthesia type, operating room time, 
and number of chronic comorbidities. Decision curve analysis revealed a net 
benefit for use of the random forest model and the model was integrated into a 
web-based open-access application.
CONCLUSIONS: The random forest model predicted cost after ambulatory ACLR using 
a large, statewide database with good performance. The top variables found to 
predict increased charges were general anesthesia, operating room time, meniscal 
repair, self-pay insurance, patient neighborhood characteristics, and number of 
chronic conditions.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III, retrospective cohort study.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate medication factors and patient characteristics 
associated with readmissions following alcohol-related hospitalizations.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Adult patients admitted from September 1, 2016, through 
August 31, 2019, who had an alcohol-related hospitalization were identified 
through electronic health records. Patient characteristics and medications of 
interest administered during hospitalization or prescribed at discharge were 
identified. Medications of interest included US Food and Drug 
Administration-approved medications for alcohol use disorder, benzodiazepines, 
barbiturates, gabapentin, opioids, and muscle relaxants. The primary outcome was 
to identify medications and patient factors associated with 30-day 
alcohol-related readmission. Secondary outcomes included medications and patient 
characteristics associated with multiple alcohol-related readmissions within a 
year from the index admission (ie, two or more readmissions) and factors 
associated with 30-day all-cause readmission.
RESULTS: Characteristics of the 932 patients included in this study associated 
with a 30-day alcohol-related readmission included younger age, severity of 
alcohol withdrawal, history of psychiatric disorder, marital status, and the 
number of prior alcohol-related admission in the previous year. Benzodiazepine 
or barbiturate use during hospitalization or upon discharge was associated with 
30-day alcohol-related readmission (P=.006). Gabapentin administration during 
hospitalization or upon discharge was not associated with 30-day alcohol-related 
readmission (P=.079).
CONCLUSION: The findings reinforce current literature identifying 
patient-specific factors associated with 30-day readmissions. Gabapentin use was 
not associated with readmissions; however, there was an association with 
benzodiazepine/barbiturate use.

The conventional component repair in remanufacturing involves human decision 
making that is influenced by several factors such as conditions of incoming 
cores, modes of failure, severity of damage, features and geometric complexities 
of cores and types of reparation required. Repair can be enhanced through 
automation using additive manufacturing (AM) technology. Advancements in AM have 
led to the development of directed energy deposition and laser cladding 
technology for repair of damaged parts and components. The objective of this 
systematic literature review is to ascertain how intelligent systems can be 
integrated into AM-based repair, through artificial intelligence (AI) approaches 
capable of supporting the nature and process of decision making during repair. 
The integration of intelligent systems in AM repair is expected to enhance 
resource utilization and repair efficiency during remanufacturing. Based on a 
systematic literature review of articles published during 2005-2021, the study 
analyses the activities of conventional repair in remanufacturing, trends in the 
applications of AM for repair using the current state-of-the-art technology and 
how AI has been deployed to facilitate repair. The study concludes with 
suggestions on research areas and opportunities that will further enhance the 
automation of component repair during remanufacturing using intelligent AM 
systems.

University education is at a critical moment due to the pandemic generated by 
the Coronavirus Disease 2019. Universities, to guarantee the continuity of 
education, have considered it necessary to modify their educational models, 
implementing a transition towards a remote education model. This model depends 
on the use of information and communication technologies for its execution and 
the establishment of synchronous classes as a means of meeting between teachers 
and students. However, moving from face-to-face classes to online classes is not 
enough to meet all the needs of students. By not meeting the needs and 
expectations of students, problems are generated that directly affect learning. 
In this work, Big data and artificial intelligence are integrated as a solution 
in a technological architecture that supports the remote education model. This 
integration makes it possible to identify the state of learning and recommend 
immediate actions to its actors. Teachers, knowing the variables that affect 
academic performance, have the ability to change the components of learning or 
the method used. Improving learning and validating the capacity of information 
technologies to generate digital environments suitable for the generation of 
knowledge. In addition to improving the functionality of educational models and 
their adaptability to the new normal.

Background: Arterial aging is characterized by decreased vascular function, 
caused by arterial stiffness (AS), and vascular morphological changes, caused by 
arterial dilatation. We analyzed the relationship of pre-AS and AS, as assessed 
by cardio ankle vascular index (CAVI), with arterial diameters (AD) at nine 
levels, from the aortic sinus to the abdominal aorta, as measured by artificial 
intelligence (AI) on non-enhanced chest computed tomography (CT) images. 
Methods: Overall, 801 patients who underwent both chest CT scan and arterial 
elasticity test were enrolled. Nine horizontal diameters of the thoracic aorta 
(from the aortic sinuses of Valsalva to the abdominal aorta at the celiac axis 
origin) were measured by AI using CT. Patients were divided into non-AS (mean 
value of the left and right CAVIs [M.CAVI] < 8), pre-AS (8 ≤ M.CAVI < 9), and AS 
(M.CAVI ≥ 9) groups. We compared AD differences among groups, analyzed the 
correlation of age, ADs, and M.CAVI or the mean pressure-independent CAVI 
(M.CAVI0), Furthermore, we evaluated the risk predictors and the diagnostic 
value of the nine ADs for pre-AS and AS. Results: The AD at mid descending aorta 
(MD) correlated strongest with CAVI (r = 0.46, p < 0.001) or M.CAVI0 (r = 0.42, 
p < 0.001). M.CAVI was most affected by the MD AD and by age. An increase in the 
MD AD independently predicted the occurrence of pre-AS or AS. For MD AD, every 
4.37 mm increase caused a 14% increase in the pre-AS and AS risk and a 13% 
increase in the AS risk. With a cut-off value of 26.95 mm for the MD AD, the 
area under the curve (AUC) for identifying the risk of AS was 0.743. With a 
cut-off value of 25.15 mm, the AUC for identifying the risk of the stage after 
the prophase of AS is 0.739. Conclusions: Aging is associated with an increase 
in AD and a decrease in arterial elasticity. An increase in AD, particularly at 
the MD level is an independent predictor of AS development.

The advent of laparoscopy marked a fundamental change in the evolution of 
medicine. The procedure progressed consistently after the first time it was 
performed in a human being nearly a hundred years ago. The 1960's and 1980's 
witnessed groundbreaking changes. During this time, laparoscopy evolved from a 
purely diagnostic procedure into an independent surgical approach. Outstanding 
pioneers of the times were Palmer, Frangenheim and Semm. Laparoscopy advanced 
rapidly and influenced gynecology as well. The procedure was initially attacked 
most vociferously by the surgical fraternity. However, within a short period of 
time the pendulum shifted: laparoscopy became the preferred surgical approach 
for a variety of diseases-whether benign or malignant-in several medical 
disciplines. Laparoscopy has become a routine approach in the twenty-first 
century. Technical advancements have led to robot-assisted surgery. Future 
developments will include artificial intelligence and augmented reality. In the 
present article we address past milestones, current practices, and future 
challenges in laparoscopy.

Human emotions affect psychological health to a great level. Positive emotions 
relate to health improvement; whereas negative emotions may aggravate 
psychological disorders such as anxiety, stress, and depression. Although there 
exist several computational methods to predict psychological disorders, most of 
them provide a black-box view of uncertainty. This research involves developing 
a novel predictive model for multi class psychological risk recognition with an 
accurate explainable interface. Standard questionnaires are utilized as data set 
and a new approach called a Q-Prioritization is employed to drop insignificant 
questions from the data set. Moreover, a novel balanced decision tree method 
based on repetitive oversampling is applied for the training and testing of the 
model. Predictive nature along with its contributing factors are interpreted 
with three techniques such as permuted feature importance, contrastive 
explanation, and counterfactual method, which together form a reasoning engine. 
The prediction outcome generated an impressive performance with an aggregated 
accuracy of 98.25%. The mean precision, recall, and F-score metric recorded were 
0.98, 0.977, and 0.979, respectively. Also, it was noted that without applying 
Q-Prioritization, the accuracy significantly drops to 90.25%. The error rate 
observed with our model was only 0.026. The proposed multi-level psychological 
disorder predictive model can successfully serve as an assistive deployment for 
medical experts in the effective treatment of mental health.

Background: Many parts of the world that succeeded in suppressing epidemic 
coronavirus spread in 2020 have been caught out by recent changes in the 
transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. Australia's early success in suppressing 
COVID-19 resulted in lengthy periods without community transmission. However, a 
slow vaccine rollout leaves this geographically isolated population vulnerable 
to leakage of new variants from quarantine, which requires internal travel 
restrictions, disruptive lockdowns, contact tracing and testing surges. Methods: 
To assist long term sustainment of limited public health resources, we sought a 
method of continuous, real-time COVID-19 risk monitoring that could be used to 
alert non-specialists to the level of epidemic risk on a sub-national scale. 
After an exploratory data assessment, we selected four COVID-19 metrics used by 
public health in their periodic threat assessments, applied a business 
continuity matrix and derived a numeric indicator; the COVID-19 Risk Estimate 
(CRE), to generate a daily spot CRE, a 3 day net rise and a seven day rolling 
average. We used open source data updated daily from all Australian states and 
territories to monitor the CRE for over a year. Results: Upper and lower CRE 
thresholds were established for the CRE seven day rolling average, corresponding 
to risk of sustained and potential outbreak propagation, respectively. These CRE 
thresholds were used in a real-time map of Australian COVID-19 risk estimate 
distribution by state and territory. Conclusions: The CRE toolkit we developed 
complements other COVID-19 risk management techniques and provides an early 
indication of emerging threats to business continuity.

BACKGROUND: We have obtained prospective clinical outcomes using the brachial 
artery largely, such as Korotkoff sound and vasomotor function measurement by 
ultrasound guidance to predict the prognosis of cardiovascular diseases. Very 
few reports on the quantitative measurement of the relationship between the 
brachial artery blood flow and cardiac output have been reported.
PURPOSE: (1) To investigate whether the quantitative relationship between the 
brachial artery blood flow and cardiac output existed. (2) To provide a 
theoretical basis for taking advantage of artificial intelligence (AI) using 
Korotkoff sound analogously as far as possible to predict the cardiac output.
METHODS: A total of 586 patients who underwent cardiac color ultrasound in our 
center from 2021.3 to 2021.7 were included for analyses. The vascular parameters 
of the right upper limb brachial artery (such as the Diameter, Area, Blood 
Velocity, and Flow) were measured immediately after the cardiac color 
ultrasound, and some basic clinical parameters (Age, Sex, BMI, and Disease) were 
recorded subsequently. Ultimately, the Mann-Whitney and independent sample 
T-test were used to analyze the data.
RESULTS: (1) The mean Rate of the brachial arterial blood flow to cardiac output 
was 1.23%, and the mean 95% CI was (1.18%, 1.29%), indicating that the value was 
mainly concentrated in the current value interval. The indicator demonstrates 
that there is no significant difference currently among the patients with 
hypertension, coronary heart disease, and cardiac dysfunction. (2) The brachial 
artery wall diameter (Dist) is significantly thicker in patients with coronary 
heart disease and hypertension compared to patients with other cardiovascular 
diseases. (3) Cardiac output augments remarkably in patients with hypertension.
CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that the Rate (brachial artery blood flow/cardiac 
output) is a constant of 1.23% approximately. It provides a theoretical basis 
for the subsequent application of the artificial intelligence (AI) method to 
predict heart function using Korotkoff sound, cope with large computational 
amounts, and improve computational speed. It is also indirectly proved that 
hypertension can lead to a change in peripheral vascular hyperplasia and 
increase cardiac output.

During the past two decades, many remote sensing image fusion techniques have 
been designed to improve the spatial resolution of the low-spatial-resolution 
multispectral bands. The main objective is fuse the low-resolution multispectral 
(MS) image and the high-spatial-resolution panchromatic (PAN) image to obtain a 
fused image having high spatial and spectral information. Recently, many 
artificial intelligence-based deep learning models have been designed to fuse 
the remote sensing images. But these models do not consider the inherent image 
distribution difference between MS and PAN images. Therefore, the obtained fused 
images may suffer from gradient and color distortion problems. To overcome these 
problems, in this paper, an efficient artificial intelligence-based deep 
transfer learning model is proposed. Inception-ResNet-v2 model is improved by 
using a color-aware perceptual loss (CPL). The obtained fused images are further 
improved by using gradient channel prior as a postprocessing step. Gradient 
channel prior is used to preserve the color and gradient information. Extensive 
experiments are carried out by considering the benchmark datasets. Performance 
analysis shows that the proposed model can efficiently preserve color and 
gradient information in the fused remote sensing images than the existing 
models.

Improving the quality of college physical education is of great significance to 
facilitating the integrated development of students' psyches and physical. 
Establishing a more systematic, effective, and social training needs of 
education quality evaluation hierarchy is also the centerpiece of the college 
physical culture education administration. Massive information technology 
provides new conception and methods to this, and supply advantage sustains for 
furtherance the education ecology development. Based on the network education 
system, this paper uses big data to quantify the evaluation indexes of physical 
education teaching, so as to actualize the timely dynamic evaluation of the 
process that is physical teaching and learning. This essay constructs the 
evaluation index system of college physical education teaching quality by 
combining mensurable and qualitative methods. On the basis of previous studies, 
an evaluation model of college physical education teaching quality based on 
artificial intelligence mass data calculation is designed. The experiment 
authenticates that the model evaluation risk coefficient is 1.93 lower than the 
optimized model. The experiment also proves that the model is conducive to 
elevating the education quality.

This research focuses on the synthesis of linkage parameters for a bistable 
compliant system (BSCS) to be widely implemented within space applications. 
Initially, BSCS was theoretically modeled as a crank-slider mechanism, utilizing 
pseudo-rigid-body model (PRBM) on stiffness coefficient (v), with a maximum 
vertical footprint (b max) for enhancing vibration characteristics. Correlations 
for mechanism linkage parameters (MLPs) and responses (v and b max) were set up 
by utilizing analysis of variance for response surface (RSM) technique. RSM 
evaluated the impact of MLPs at individual/interacting levels on responses. 
Consequently, a hybrid genetic algorithm-based particle swarm/flock optimization 
(GA-PSO) technique was employed and optimized at multiple levels for assessing 
ideal MLP combinations, in order to minimize characteristics (10% v + 90% of b 
max). Finally, GA-PSO estimated the most appropriate Pareto-frontal optimum 
solutions (PFOS) from nondominance set and crowd/flocking space approaches. The 
resulting PFOS from validation trials demonstrated significant improvement in 
responses. The adapted GA-PSO algorithm was executed with ease, extending the 
convergence period (through GA) and exhibiting a good diversity of objectives, 
allowing the development of large-scale statistics for all MLP permutations as 
optimal solutions. A vast set of optimal solutions can be used as a reference 
manual for mechanism developers.

Objective: To explore the dynamic features of intrinsic brain activity measured 
by fMRI in children with benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS) and 
examine whether these indexes were associated with behaviors. Methods: We 
recruited 26 children with BECTS (10.35 ± 2.91 years) and 26 sex-, and 
age-matched (11.35 ± 2.51 years) healthy controls (HC) and acquired 
resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and behavioral 
data. Dynamic regional homogeneity (dReHo), including mean and coefficient of 
variation (CV) metrics derived from the rs-fMRI data, and were compared between 
the BECTS and the HC groups. Results: Significantly decreased mean dReHo in 
bilateral supramarginal gyrus, left middle temporal gyrus (MTG.L), left 
postcentral gyrus and superior occipital gyrus were found in children with 
BECTS. Meanwhile, increased CV of dReHo in MTG.L and right fusiform in children 
with BECTS was revealed compared with HC. Further analyses of functional 
connectivity revealed decreased global signal FC existed in similar regions, 
linked with linguistic, social cognition, and sensorimotor processes, in 
children with BECTS compared with HCs. Moreover, the association analyses showed 
that the CV of dReHo in MTG.L was positively associated with age and a negative 
correlation was found between mean dReHo of MTG.L and disease duration. Besides, 
the CV of dReHo in MTG.L was found positively associated with the intelligence 
quotient (IQ) language scores and full IQ scores in children with BECTS, and the 
CV of dReHo in the left inferior temporal gyrus and Rolandic operculum were 
positively correlated with IQ operation scores and full IQ scores. Conclusion: 
Aberrant dynamic regional coherence in sensorimotor, linguistic, and lateral 
temporal regions suggests dynamical interplay that underlying cognitive 
performance in children with BECTS, suggesting an intrinsic dynamic mechanism 
for BECTS.

With the advancement in AI and related technologies, we are witnessing more 
remarkable use of intelligent vehicles. Intelligent vehicles use smart automatic 
features that make travel happier, safer, and efficient. However, not many 
studies examine their adoption or the influence of intelligent vehicles on user 
behavior. In this study, we specifically examine how intelligent vehicles' 
sensing and acting abilities drive their adoption from the lens of psychological 
empowerment theory. We identify three dimensions of users' perceived empowerment 
(perceived cognitive empowerment, perceived emotional empowerment, and perceived 
behavioral empowerment). Based on this theory, we argue that product features 
(sensing and acting in intelligent vehicles) empower users to use the product. 
Our proposed model is validated by an online survey of 312 car owners who are 
familiar with driving conditions, the results of this study reveal that driver's 
perceived empowerment is vital for using automatic features of intelligent 
vehicles. Theoretically, this study combines the concept of empowerment with the 
intelligent-driving scenario and reasonably explains the mechanism of the 
intelligence of vehicles on users' behavior intention.

Very preterm children (gestational age < 32 weeks) frequently show 
neurodevelopmental difficulties (Inattention/dysexecutiveness) throughout their 
life-stages. A scarcity of resources, along with this population's cognitive 
vulnerability, makes the neuropsychological evaluation of these children both 
complicated and time-consuming. This study aimed to develop a specific and valid 
Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fifth Edition (WISC-V) short-form to 
estimate intellectual functioning in this population. Eighty-four very preterm 
children (39 female; mean age = 6.50; SD: 0.06) were assessed with the WISC-V. 
Short-forms were developed following two independent strategies: a) multiple 
linear regressions for each index; b) correlational analyses between scores on 
all administered subtests and Full-Scale IQ. Validity of short-forms was 
analyzed. A short-form (Vocabulary, Matrix Reasoning, Picture Span, and Symbol 
Search) that satisfied 2/3 validation criteria was proposed. This validated 
short-form could facilitate the identification of cognitive difficulties in very 
preterm children, so that they could benefit from early care and support 
services, avoiding long assessment procedures.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, educational centers and universities in Venezuela 
have closed their physical plants and are migrating to emergency remote 
education to continue with academic programs. This empirical study aimed to 
analyze the predictive capacity of academic self-efficacy and emotional 
intelligence skills on each of the dimensions of psychological well-being. We 
employed a cross-sectional predictive design. The sample comprised 277 
university students, of which 252 were female (91.00%). Their ages ranged from 
18 to 45 years, with a mean of 20.35 (SD = 2.29). Non-probabilistic chance 
sampling was used. For data collection, we used an anonymous online form, 
contacted students by mail, and invited them to participate in the study. 
Questionnaires were available between 217 and 227 days of decreed quarantine in 
Venezuela. The results indicated average levels of academic self-efficacy (Me = 
4; IQR = 2), emotional intelligence: clarity (Me = 27; IQR = 10), attention (Me 
= 25; IQR = 10) y repair (Me = 25; IQR = 12), and psychological well-being (Me = 
35; IQR = 5). We found differences according to sex and age, specifically in 
emotional regulation (z = 3.73, p < 0.001, d = 0.438) and in bonds of 
psychological well-being (z = 2.51, p = 0.012, d = 0.276) favoring men (Me = 33, 
IQR = 9; Me = 8, IQR = 1), respectively. Regarding age, statistically 
significant differences were found in the group of students older than 21 years 
with higher perception of psychological well-being (z = 3.69, p < 0.001, d = 
0.43) and in each of its dimensions. Emotional intelligence and academic 
self-efficacy were found to be significant predictors of psychological 
well-being and its dimensions, specifically on control (R 2-Cox = 0.25, R 
2-Nagelkerke = 0.34, 69.90% of total correct classification), links (R 2-Cox = 
0.09, R 2-Nagelkerke = 0.12, 65.07% of total correct classification), projects 
(R 2-Cox = 0.32, R 2-Nagelkerke = 0.46, 78.40% of total correct classification), 
acceptance (R 2-Cox = 0.17, R 2-Nagelkerke = 0.23, 68.28% of total correct 
classification), and total well-being (R 2-Cox = 0.52, R 2-Nagelkerke = 0.71, 
87.16% of total correct classification). It was concluded that emotional 
intelligence and academic self-efficacy are protective psychological resources 
of psychological well-being that should be promoted at university to mitigate 
the negative effects of the pandemic on the mental health of young people.

Background and Objective: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) refers to a 
heterogeneous set of neurodevelopmental disorders with diverse symptom severity 
and comorbidities. Although alterations in gut microbiota have been reported in 
individuals with ASD, it remains unclear whether certain microbial pattern is 
linked to specific symptom or comorbidity in ASD. We aimed to investigate the 
associations between gut microbiota and the severity of social impairment and 
cognitive functioning in children with ASD. Methods: A total of 261 age-matched 
children, including 138 children diagnosed with ASD, 63 with developmental delay 
or intellectual disability (DD/ID), and 60 typically developing (TD) children, 
were enrolled from the Shanghai Xinhua Registry. The children with ASD were 
further classified into two subgroups: 76 children diagnosed with ASD and 
developmental disorder (ASD+DD) and 62 with ASD only (ASD-only). The gut 
microbiome of all children was profiled and evaluated by 16S ribosomal RNA 
sequencing. Results: The gut microbial analyses demonstrated an altered 
microbial community structure in children with ASD. The alpha diversity indices 
of the ASD+DD and ASD-only subgroups were significantly lower than the DD/ID or 
TD groups. At the genus level, we observed a decrease in the relative abundance 
of Prevotella. Simultaneously, Bacteroides and Faecalibacterium were 
significantly increased in ASD compared with DD/ID and TD participants. There 
was a clear correlation between alpha diversity and the Childhood Autism Rating 
Scale (CARS) total score for all participants, and this correlation was 
independent of IQ performance. Similar correlations with the CARS total score 
were observed for genera Bacteroides, Faecalibacterium, and Oscillospira. 
However, there was no single genus significantly associated with IQ in all 
participants. Conclusions: Specific alterations in bacterial taxonomic 
composition and associations with the severity of social impairment and IQ 
performance were observed in children with ASD or ASD subgroups, when compared 
with DD/ID or TD groups. These results illustrate that gut microbiota may serve 
as a promising biomarker for ASD symptoms. Nevertheless, further investigations 
are warranted.

The first step to exercise is preceded by the required assumption of the upright 
body position, which itself involves physical activity. The gravitational 
displacement of blood from the chest to the lower parts of the body elicits a 
fall in central blood volume (CBV), which corresponds to the fraction of 
thoracic blood volume directly available to the left ventricle. The reduction in 
CBV and stroke volume (SV) in response to postural stress, post-exercise, or to 
blood loss results in reduced left ventricular filling, which may manifest as 
orthostatic intolerance. When termination of exercise removes the leg muscle 
pump function, CBV is no longer maintained. The resulting imbalance between a 
reduced cardiac output (CO) and a still enhanced peripheral vascular conductance 
may provoke post-exercise hypotension (PEH). Instruments that quantify CBV are 
not readily available and to express which magnitude of the CBV in a healthy 
subject should remains difficult. In the physiological laboratory, the CBV can 
be modified by making use of postural stressors, such as lower body "negative" 
or sub-atmospheric pressure (LBNP) or passive head-up tilt (HUT), while 
quantifying relevant biomedical parameters of blood flow and oxygenation. 
Several approaches, such as wearable sensors and advanced machine-learning 
techniques, have been followed in an attempt to improve methodologies for better 
prediction of outcomes and to guide treatment in civil patients and on the 
battlefield. In the recent decade, efforts have been made to develop algorithms 
and apply artificial intelligence (AI) in the field of hemodynamic monitoring. 
Advances in quantifying and monitoring CBV during environmental stress from 
exercise to hemorrhage and understanding the analogy between postural stress and 
central hypovolemia during anesthesia offer great relevance for healthy subjects 
and clinical populations.

The analysis of electrical impulse phenomena in cardiac muscle tissue is 
important for the diagnosis of heart rhythm disorders and other cardiac 
pathophysiology. Cardiac mapping techniques acquire local temporal measurements 
and combine them to visualize the spread of electrophysiological wave phenomena 
across the heart surface. However, low spatial resolution, sparse measurement 
locations, noise and other artifacts make it challenging to accurately visualize 
spatio-temporal activity. For instance, electro-anatomical catheter mapping is 
severely limited by the sparsity of the measurements, and optical mapping is 
prone to noise and motion artifacts. In the past, several approaches have been 
proposed to create more reliable maps from noisy or sparse mapping data. Here, 
we demonstrate that deep learning can be used to compute phase maps and detect 
phase singularities in optical mapping videos of ventricular fibrillation, as 
well as in very noisy, low-resolution and extremely sparse simulated data of 
reentrant wave chaos mimicking catheter mapping data. The self-supervised deep 
learning approach is fundamentally different from classical phase mapping 
techniques. Rather than encoding a phase signal from time-series data, a deep 
neural network instead learns to directly associate phase maps and the positions 
of phase singularities with short spatio-temporal sequences of electrical data. 
We tested several neural network architectures, based on a convolutional neural 
network (CNN) with an encoding and decoding structure, to predict phase maps or 
rotor core positions either directly or indirectly via the prediction of phase 
maps and a subsequent classical calculation of phase singularities. Predictions 
can be performed across different data, with models being trained on one species 
and then successfully applied to another, or being trained solely on simulated 
data and then applied to experimental data. Neural networks provide a promising 
alternative to conventional phase mapping and rotor core localization methods. 
Future uses may include the analysis of optical mapping studies in basic 
cardiovascular research, as well as the mapping of atrial fibrillation in the 
clinical setting.

Personalization of gait neuroprosthetics is paramount to ensure their efficacy 
for users, who experience severe limitations in mobility without an assistive 
device. Our goal is to develop assistive devices that collaborate with and are 
tailored to their users, while allowing them to use as much of their existing 
capabilities as possible. Currently, personalization of devices is challenging, 
and technological advances are required to achieve this goal. Therefore, this 
paper presents an overview of challenges and research directions regarding an 
interface with the peripheral nervous system, an interface with the central 
nervous system, and the requirements of interface computing architectures. The 
interface should be modular and adaptable, such that it can provide assistance 
where it is needed. Novel data processing technology should be developed to 
allow for real-time processing while accounting for signal variations in the 
human. Personalized biomechanical models and simulation techniques should be 
developed to predict assisted walking motions and interactions between the user 
and the device. Furthermore, the advantages of interfacing with both the brain 
and the spinal cord or the periphery should be further explored. Technological 
advances of interface computing architecture should focus on learning on the 
chip to achieve further personalization. Furthermore, energy consumption should 
be low to allow for longer use of the neuroprosthesis. In-memory processing 
combined with resistive random access memory is a promising technology for both. 
This paper discusses the aforementioned aspects to highlight new directions for 
future research in gait neuroprosthetics.

Classification of electroencephalogram (EEG) is a key approach to measure the 
rhythmic oscillations of neural activity, which is one of the core technologies 
of brain-computer interface systems (BCIs). However, extraction of the features 
from non-linear and non-stationary EEG signals is still a challenging task in 
current algorithms. With the development of artificial intelligence, various 
advanced algorithms have been proposed for signal classification in recent 
years. Among them, deep neural networks (DNNs) have become the most attractive 
type of method due to their end-to-end structure and powerful ability of 
automatic feature extraction. However, it is difficult to collect large-scale 
datasets in practical applications of BCIs, which may lead to overfitting or 
weak generalizability of the classifier. To address these issues, a promising 
technique has been proposed to improve the performance of the decoding model 
based on data augmentation (DA). In this article, we investigate recent studies 
and development of various DA strategies for EEG classification based on DNNs. 
The review consists of three parts: what kind of paradigms of EEG-based on BCIs 
are used, what types of DA methods are adopted to improve the DNN models, and 
what kind of accuracy can be obtained. Our survey summarizes the current 
practices and performance outcomes that aim to promote or guide the deployment 
of DA to EEG classification in future research and development.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is initiated by traumatic-stress exposure 
and manifests into a collection of symptoms including increased anxiety, sleep 
disturbances, enhanced response to triggers, and increased sympathetic nervous 
system arousal. PTSD is highly co-occurring with alcohol use disorder. Only some 
individuals experiencing traumatic stress develop PTSD and a subset of 
individuals with PTSD develop co-occurring alcohol use disorder. To investigate 
the basis of these individual responses to traumatic stress, single prolonged 
stress (SPS) a rodent model of traumatic stress was applied to young adult 
female rats. Individual responses to SPS were characterized by measuring 
anxiety-like behaviors with open field and elevated plus maze tests. Rats were 
then allowed to drink ethanol under an intermittent two bottle choice procedure 
for 8 weeks, and ethanol consumption was measured. An artificial intelligence 
algorithm was built to predict resilient and vulnerable individuals based on 
data from anxiety testing and ethanol consumption. This model was implemented in 
a second cohort of rats that underwent SPS without ethanol drinking to identify 
resilient and vulnerable individuals for further study. Analysis of neuropeptide 
Y (NPY) levels and expression of its receptors Y1R and Y2R mRNA in the central 
nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), basolateral amygdala (BLA), and bed nucleus stria 
terminalis (BNST) were performed. Results demonstrate that resilient rats had 
higher expression of Y2R mRNA in the CeA compared with vulnerable and control 
rats and had higher levels of NPY protein in the BNST compared to controls. The 
results of the study show that an artificial intelligence algorithm can identify 
individual differences in response to traumatic stress which can be used to 
predict subsequent ethanol drinking, and the NPY pathway is differentially 
altered following traumatic stress exposure in resilient and vulnerable 
populations. Understanding neurochemical alterations following traumatic-stress 
exposure is critical in developing prevention strategies for the vulnerable 
phenotype and will help further development of novel therapeutic approaches for 
individuals suffering from PTSD and at risk for alcohol use disorder.

The COVID-19 medical diagnosis method based on individual's chest X-ray (CXR) is 
achieved difficultly in the initial research, owing to difficulties in 
identifying CXR data of COVID-19 individuals. At the beginning of the study, 
infected individuals' CXRs were scarce. The combination of artificial 
intelligence and medical diagnosis has been advanced and popular. To solve the 
difficulties, the interpretability analysis of AI model was used to explore the 
pathological characteristics of CXR samples infected with COVID-19 and assist 
medical diagnosis. The dataset was expanded by data augmentation to avoid 
overfitting. Transfer learning was used to test different pre-trained models and 
the unique output layers were designed to complete the model training with few 
samples. In this study, the output results of four pre-trained models were 
compared in three different output layers, and the results after data 
augmentation were compared with the results of the original dataset. The control 
variable method was used to conduct independent tests of 24 groups. Finally, 
99.23% accuracy and 98% recall rate were obtained, and the visual results of CXR 
interpretability analysis were displayed. The network of COVID-19 interpretable 
diagnosis algorithm has the characteristics of high generalization and 
lightweight. It can be quickly applied to other urgent tasks with insufficient 
experimental data. At the same time, interpretability analysis brings new 
possibilities for medical diagnosis.

BACKGROUND: When pain caused by lumbar disc herniation (LDH) is not relieved 
after 4 to 6 weeks of conservative treatment, surgery is recommended. Open 
microdiscectomy is a standard surgical technique, but surgical endoscopy enables 
endoscopic lumbar surgery with clinical outcomes similar to those of standard 
microdiscectomy. Endoscopic lumbar discectomy is largely divided into 
transforaminal endoscopic lumbar discectomy (TELD) and interlaminar endoscopic 
lumbar discectomy (IELD). TELD was introduced about 10 years earlier than IELD 
and seems to be more popular than IELD.
OBJECTIVE: The present article reviews the surgical technique, indications, and 
outcomes of IELD. Although much is still unknown, potential future perspectives 
are reviewed.
SUMMARY: Although improved surgical techniques enable TELD to be versatile, IELD 
is still specifically beneficial for patients with highly migrated LDH and a 
high iliac crest. There is a large body of literature indicating favorable 
outcomes with both TELD and IELD. Currently, the selection of TELD or IELD is at 
the discretion of the surgeon, but the IELD surgical technique is useful for 
further applying endoscopic lumbar surgery for lumbar decompression or lumbar 
interbody fusion. The techniques can be assisted by advanced technologies such 
as artificial intelligence, surgical robots, and artificial reality, and a 
precise and systematic approach to decision-making and surgical techniques is 
required to combine these technologies effectively.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The quality of EGD is a prerequisite for a high detection 
rate of upper GI lesions, especially early gastric cancer. Our previous study 
showed that an artificial intelligence system, named intelligent detection 
endoscopic assistant (IDEA), could help to monitor blind spots and provide an 
operation score during EGD. Here, we verified the effectiveness of IDEA to help 
evaluate the quality of EGD in a large-scale multicenter trial.
METHODS: Patients undergoing EGD in 12 hospitals were consecutively enrolled. 
All hospitals were equipped with IDEA developed using deep convolutional neural 
networks and long short-term memory. Patients were examined by EGD, and the 
results were recorded by IDEA. The primary outcome was the detection rate of 
upper GI cancer. Secondary outcomes were part scores, total scores, and 
endoscopic procedure time, which were analyzed by IDEA.
RESULTS: A total of 17,787 patients were recruited. The total detection rate of 
cancer-positive cases was 1.50%, ranging from .60% to 3.94% in each hospital. 
The total detection rate of early cancer-positive cases was .36%, ranging from 
.00% to 1.58% in each hospital. The average total score analyzed by IDEA ranged 
from 64.87 ± 16.87 to 83.50 ± 9.57 in each hospital. The cancer detection rate 
in each hospital was positively correlated with total score (r = .775, P = 
.003). Similarly, the early cancer detection rate was positively correlated with 
total score (r = .756, P = .004).
CONCLUSIONS: This multicenter trial confirmed that the quality of the EGD result 
is positively correlated with the detection rate of cancer, which can be 
monitored by IDEA. (Clinical trial registration number: ChiCTR2000029001.).

IMPORTANCE: Clinical events adjudication is pivotal for generating consistent 
and comparable evidence in clinical trials. The methodology of event 
adjudication is evolving, but research is needed to develop best practices and 
spur innovation.
OBSERVATIONS: A meeting of stakeholders from regulatory agencies, academic and 
contract research organizations, pharmaceutical and device companies, and 
clinical trialists convened in Chicago, IL, for Clinical Events Classification 
(CEC) Summit 2018 to discuss key topics and future directions. Formal studies 
are lacking on strategies to optimize CEC conduct, improve efficiency, minimize 
cost, and generally increase the speed and accuracy of the event adjudication 
process. Major challenges to CEC discussed included ensuring rigorous quality of 
the process, identifying safety events, standardizing event definitions, using 
uniform strategies for missing information, facilitating interactions between 
CEC members and other trial leadership, and determining the CEC's role in 
pragmatic trials or trials using real-world data. Consensus recommendations from 
the meeting include the following: (1) ensure an adequate adjudication 
infrastructure; (2) use negatively adjudicated events to identify important 
safety events reported only outside the scope of the primary endpoint; (3) 
conduct further research in the use of artificial intelligence and 
digital/mobile technologies to streamline adjudication processes; and (4) 
emphasize the importance of standardizing event definitions and quality metrics 
of CEC programs.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: As novel strategies for clinical trials emerge to 
generate evidence for regulatory approval and to guide clinical practice, a 
greater understanding of the role of the CEC process will be critical to 
optimize trial conduct and increase confidence in the data generated.

OBJECTIVES: The validity and reliability of the psychological assessment of 
auditory perceptions, as typified by the grade, roughness, breathiness, 
asthenia, and strain (GRBAS) scale, have been widely recognized. However, due to 
their subjective nature, inter- and intra-examiner reliability are unavoidable. 
In this study, we aimed to add objectivity to the GRBAS scale using artificial 
intelligence and to compare the accuracy of two methods-one based on Google's 
TensorFlow and another based on Apple's Core ML.
METHODS: The GRBAS scale of 1,377 vowel samples was evaluated and used as 
training data to create a machine learning model. We used TensorFlow and Apple's 
Create ML to create two machine learning models and examined the difference in 
their accuracies for classifying the severity of pathological Voice data based 
on the GRBAS scale.
RESULTS: Absolute comparisons are difficult to make because of the difference in 
methods; however, both training models could objectively evaluate GRBAS scales 
and were statistically correlated in G and B.
CONCLUSION: While TensorFlow requires creation of a training model from scratch, 
Create ML is a relatively easy way to create a training model for voice by 
adding training data for GRBAS scales to an existing training model for sounds. 
Although the data handling and learning methods are different, both models 
performed well. Findings from this study could be used for medical screening 
purposes, and there is the potential to change the clinical approach to voice 
diagnostics in the future.

INTRODUCTION: The development of emotional competences may be a protective 
factor for mental health problems, promoting well-being at such a complex age as 
adolescence. Technologies may be used to carry out this empowerment because 
adolescents are attracted to them. The purpose of the study is to design a 
serious game based on the Mayer et al's emotional intelligence ability model and 
analyse the effectiveness of the emoTIC programme to develop emotional 
competences, well-being, mental health, and personal strengths immediately after 
completion and at 12 months.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The new version of emoTIC will be designed following the 
suggestions of the adolescents who participated in the pilot study and the 
results obtained from the statistical analysis. The participants will be 385 
adolescents aged 11-16 years who will be randomly assigned to the control group 
and the experimental group. The experimental group will complete the emoTIC 
programme. The primary outcomes include emotional competences and subjective 
well-being. The secondary outcomes are self-esteem; general self-efficacy; 
personality; social and personal responsibility; school social climate; somatic 
complaints; depression, anxiety and stress symptoms; emotional and behavioural 
difficulties; suicidal behaviour; and subjective happiness. Data will be 
collected at three moments: baseline (T1), immediately post-intervention (T2) 
and 12-month follow-up (T3). The effectiveness of the programme will be analysed 
using different statistical packages.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has been approved by the Ethics Commission 
of the University of Valencia (H152865096049), and the standards of the 
Declaration of Helsinki to collect the data will be followed. Results will be 
disseminated across the scientific community.

The pandemic of the new coronavirus infection has swept the world and killed 
more than 5 million people, which has shocked all human beings who have believed 
in modern medical progress. Along with the sedation of infections, the balance 
between restriction and acceleration of socio-economic activities is difficult. 
With the spread of vaccines and the advent of viral therapeutic agents, we 
expect how to control this pandemic has finally become visible. In this 
situation, we realize that data science and robotics innovations are quite 
important in many medical fields. Artificial intelligence (AI) diagnosis and 
remote medical care are becoming a reality, and this direction will accelerate 
further in 2022, the first year of post-pandemic. The trend of digital 
transformation (Dx) will also be rushing into Orthopedics next year. In 
addition, research on virtual reality and augmented reality is being actively 
conducted, and it has become possible to use it for surgical simulation and 
technical training. As, in the field of abdominal surgery, remote robotic 
surgery will soon become available in the field of orthopedics as well. These Dx 
trend will prevail to our field instead of experience, and knowledge of 
medicine, which can change the medical care style dramatically in near future. 
It is crucial for orthopedic surgeons to always aim for its development and 
evolution.

Social and health care equity and justice should be prioritized by the mantra of 
medicine, first do no harm. Despite highly motivated national and global health 
strategies, there remains significant health care inequity. Intrinsic and 
extrinsic factors, including a number of biases, are key drivers of ongoing 
health inequity including equity of access and opportunity for nuclear medicine 
and radiology services. There is a substantial gap in the global practice of 
nuclear medicine in particular, but also radiology, between developed health 
economies and those considered developing or undeveloped. At a local level, even 
in developed health economies, there can be a significant disparity between 
health services, including medical imaging, between communities based on 
socioeconomic, cultural or geographic differences. Artificial intelligence (AI) 
has the potential to either widen the health inequity divide or substantially 
reduce it. Distributed generally, AI technology could be used to overcome 
geographic boundaries to health care, thus bringing general and specialist care 
into underserved communities. However, should AI technology be limited to 
localities already enjoying ample healthcare access and direct access to health 
infrastructure, like radiology and nuclear medicine, it could then accentuate 
the gap. There are a number of challenges across the AI pipeline that need 
careful attention to ensure beneficence over maleficence. Fully realized, AI 
augmented health care could be crafted as an integral part of the broader 
strategy convergence on local, national and global health equity. The 
applications of AI in nuclear medicine and radiology could emerge as a powerful 
tool in social and health equity.

Real-time tracking of the dynamic intrusion targets consists of two crucial 
factors: the path forecast of the target and real-time path optimization of 
multi-UAV target tracking. For the first one, the uncertainty of the target 
trajectory is an obstacle to realizing real-time tracking. Thus a trajectory 
prediction method is proposed in this paper to ensure the sampling period of the 
target. Owing to the poor prediction accuracy of the single-step trajectory, a 
multi-step Unscented Kalman Filter (MUKF) is proposed to forecast its multi-step 
trajectory further in different regions. For the second one, there are two 
problems: poor optimization accuracy of the tracking trajectory and larger local 
optimization deviation, which will cause failure of the regional tracking. Under 
this circumstance, a hybrid algorithm called SAQPSO is proposed, combining the 
specific mechanism of two intelligence algorithms. The annealing mechanism in 
the Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm is used to modify the Quantum Particle 
Swarm Optimization (QPSO) algorithm. Then the characteristic of quantum 
particles is used to update the population and enhance global searchability. 
Furthermore, to testify the effectiveness of the trajectory optimization 
algorithm and related target prediction method, a specific simulation 
environment is given as an example, in which the tracking trajectories of eight 
different algorithms are compared. Simulation results show the effectiveness of 
the proposed algorithm.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a technology at the center of many 
political, economic, and societal debates. This paper formulates a new AI patent 
search strategy and applies this to provide a landscape analysis of AI 
innovation dynamics and technology evolution. The paper uses patent analyses, 
network analyses, and source path link count algorithms to examine AI spatial 
and temporal trends, cooperation features, cross-organization knowledge flow and 
technological routes. Results indicate a growing yet concentrated, 
non-collaborative and multi-path development and protection profile for AI 
patenting, with cross-organization knowledge flows based mainly on 
interorganizational knowledge citation links.

Each year, 1.35 million people are killed on the world's roads and another 20-50 
million are seriously injured. Morbidity or serious injury from road traffic 
collisions is estimated to increase to 265 million people between 2015 and 2030. 
Current road safety management systems rely heavily on manual data collection, 
visual inspection and subjective expert judgment for their effectiveness, which 
is costly, time-consuming, and sometimes ineffective due to under-reporting and 
the poor quality of the data. A range of innovations offers the potential to 
provide more comprehensive and effective data collection and analysis to improve 
road safety. However, there has been no systematic analysis of this evidence 
base. To this end, this paper provides a systematic review of the state of the 
art. It identifies that digital technologies - Artificial Intelligence (AI), 
Machine-Learning, Image-Processing, Internet-of-Things (IoT), Smartphone 
applications, Geographic Information System (GIS), Global Positioning System 
(GPS), Drones, Social Media, Virtual-reality, Simulator, Radar, Sensor, Big Data 
- provide useful means for identifying and providing information on road safety 
factors including road user behaviour, road characteristics and operational 
environment. Moreover, the results show that digital technologies such as AI, 
Image processing and IoT have been widely applied to enhance road safety, due to 
their ability to automatically capture and analyse data while preventing the 
possibility of human error. However, a key gap in the literature remains their 
effectiveness in real-world environments. This limits their potential to be 
utilised by policymakers and practitioners.

PURPOSE: We introduce and validate an artificial intelligence (AI)-accelerated 
multi-shot echo-planar imaging (msEPI)-based method that provides T1w, T2w, T2∗ 
, T2-FLAIR, and DWI images with high SNR, high tissue contrast, low specific 
absorption rates (SAR), and minimal distortion in 2 minutes.
METHODS: The rapid imaging technique combines a novel machine learning (ML) 
scheme to limit g-factor noise amplification and improve SNR, a magnetization 
transfer preparation module to provide clinically desirable contrast, and high 
per-shot EPI undersampling factors to reduce distortion. The ML training and 
image reconstruction incorporates a tunable parameter for controlling the level 
of denoising/smoothness. The performance of the reconstruction method is 
evaluated across various acceleration factors, contrasts, and SNR conditions. 
The 2-minute protocol is directly compared to a 10-minute clinical reference 
protocol through deployment in a clinical setting, where five representative 
cases with pathology are examined.
RESULTS: Optimization of custom msEPI sequences and protocols was performed to 
balance acquisition efficiency and image quality compared to the five-fold 
longer clinical reference. Training data from 16 healthy subjects across 
multiple contrasts and orientations were used to produce ML networks at various 
acceleration levels. The flexibility of the ML reconstruction was demonstrated 
across SNR levels, and an optimized regularization was determined through 
radiological review. Network generalization toward novel pathology, unobserved 
during training, was illustrated in five clinical case studies with clinical 
reference images provided for comparison.
CONCLUSION: The rapid 2-minute msEPI-based protocol with tunable ML 
reconstruction allows for advantageous trade-offs between acquisition speed, 
SNR, and tissue contrast when compared to the five-fold slower standard clinical 
reference exam.

OBJECTIVE: To explore a new artificial intelligence (AI)-aided method to assist 
the clinical diagnosis of tibial plateau fractures (TPFs) and further measure 
its validity and feasibility.
METHODS: A total of 542 X-rays of TPFs were collected as a reference database. 
An AI algorithm (RetinaNet) was trained to analyze and detect TPF on the X-rays. 
The ability of the AI algorithm was determined by indexes such as detection 
accuracy and time taken for analysis. The algorithm performance was also 
compared with orthopedic physicians.
RESULTS: The AI algorithm showed a detection accuracy of 0.91 for the 
identification of TPF, which was similar to the performance of orthopedic 
physicians (0.92±0.03). The average time spent for analysis of the AI was 0.56 
s, which was 16 times faster than human performance (8.44±3.26 s).
CONCLUSION: The AI algorithm is a valid and efficient method for the clinical 
diagnosis of TPF. It can be a useful assistant for orthopedic physicians, which 
largely promotes clinical workflow and further guarantees the health and 
security of patients.

OBJECTIVE: Approximately 7%-50% of children with medulloblastoma (MB) develop 
postoperative cerebellar mutism syndrome (pCMS). pCMS has a short-term negative 
impact on intelligence, but effects on long-term outcomes are contradictory. The 
aim of this study was to assess long-term effects of pCMS in MB patients on 
aspects of intelligence quotient (IQ) and its perioperative risk factors.
METHODS: In this single-center retrospective cohort study, 31 children were 
included (14 pCMS). Perioperative risk factors included brainstem invasion, 
vermis incision, hydrocephalus, tumor size, severity of pCMS, neurological 
symptoms, mean body temperature (BT) on days 1-4 post surgery, and age at 
resection. Age-appropriate Wechsler Intelligence tests were assessed at least 
2 years after tumor resection.
RESULTS: Mean interval between tumor resection and neuropsychological evaluation 
was 3.9 years in pCMS and 4 years and 11 months in the no-pCMS group. No 
significant differences in IQ scores were found between groups. The pCMS group 
had a clinically relevant difference of 10 points when compared to age norms on 
verbal IQ (VIQ). Bilateral pyramidal and swallowing problems were risk factors 
for lower performance. In the overall group, tumor size, younger age at surgery, 
and raised mean BT were negatively correlated with aspects of IQ.
CONCLUSIONS: We found a clinically significant reduction of VIQ in the pCMS 
patient group. pCMS patients with a larger tumor size, younger age at surgery, a 
higher mean BT in the first days after surgery, bilateral pyramidal symptoms, 
and swallowing problems 10 days post surgery are more at risk for VIQ deficits 
at long-term.

BACKGROUND: Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) experience 
neurodevelopmental delays; however, there is limited research with preschool-age 
children. This study examined neurocognitive risk and protective factors in 
preschoolers with SCD.
PROCEDURE: Sixty-two patients with SCD (60% HbSS/HbSβ0 -thalassemia; 40% 
HbSC/HbSβ+ -thalassemia) between the ages of 3 and 6 years (mean = 4.77 years) 
received a neuropsychological evaluation as routine systematic surveillance. 
Patients were not selected for disease severity, prior central nervous system 
findings, or existing cognitive concerns. Thirty-four patients (82% HbSS/HbSβ0 
-thalassemia) were prescribed hydroxyurea (HU) at the time of their 
neuropsychological evaluation. On average, these patients had been prescribed HU 
at 2.15 (standard deviation = 1.45) years of age. The average dose was 
28.8 mg/kg/day. Besides genotype, there were no group differences in medical or 
demographic factors based on HU treatment status.
RESULTS: Patients with HbSS/HbSβ0 -thalassemia scored below normative 
expectations on measures of intelligence, verbal comprehension, and school 
readiness (false discovery rate-adjusted p-value [pFDR ] < .05). Age, sickle 
genotype, and HU treatment exposure were not associated with measured 
neurocognitive outcomes (pFDR  > .05). Greater social vulnerability at the 
community level was associated with poorer performance on measures of 
intellectual functioning, verbal comprehension, visuomotor control, and school 
readiness, as well as parent report of executive dysfunction (pFDR  < .05). 
Greater household socioeconomic status was positively associated with academic 
readiness.
CONCLUSIONS: Preschoolers with severe SCD (HbSS/HbSβ0 -thalassemia) perform 
below age expectations on measures of intelligence and academic readiness. 
Sociodemographic factors were stronger drivers of neurocognitive performance 
than disease severity or disease-modifying treatment. Neurodevelopmental 
interventions targeting the home and broader community environment are needed.

Background: Optical coherence tomography is a powerful modality to assess 
atherosclerotic lesions, but detecting lesions in high-resolution OCT is 
challenging and requires expert knowledge. Deep-learning algorithms can be used 
to automatically identify atherosclerotic lesions, facilitating identification 
of patients at risk. We trained a deep-learning algorithm (DeepAD) with 
co-registered, annotated histopathology to predict atherosclerotic lesions in 
optical coherence tomography (OCT). Methods: Two datasets were used for training 
DeepAD: (i) a histopathology data set from 7 autopsy cases with 62 OCT frames 
and co-registered histopathology for high quality manual annotation and (ii) a 
clinical data set from 51 patients with 222 OCT frames in which manual 
annotations were based on clinical expertise only. A U-net based deep 
convolutional neural network (CNN) ensemble was employed as an atherosclerotic 
lesion prediction algorithm. Results were analyzed using intersection over union 
(IOU) for segmentation. Results: DeepAD showed good performance regarding the 
prediction of atherosclerotic lesions, with a median IOU of 0.68 ± 0.18 for 
segmentation of atherosclerotic lesions. Detection of calcified lesions yielded 
an IOU = 0.34. When training the algorithm without histopathology-based 
annotations, a performance drop of >0.25 IOU was observed. The practical 
application of DeepAD was evaluated retrospectively in a clinical cohort (n = 11 
cases), showing high sensitivity as well as specificity and similar performance 
when compared to manual expert analysis. Conclusion: Automated detection of 
atherosclerotic lesions in OCT is improved using a histopathology-based 
deep-learning algorithm, allowing accurate detection in the clinical setting. An 
automated decision-support tool based on DeepAD could help in risk prediction 
and guide interventional treatment decisions.

Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) has great potential to detect fungal 
keratitis using in vivo confocal microscopy images, but its clinical value 
remains unclarified. A major limitation of its clinical utility is the lack of 
explainability and interpretability. Methods: An explainable AI (XAI) system 
based on Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and Guided 
Grad-CAM was established. In this randomized controlled trial, nine 
ophthalmologists (three expert ophthalmologists, three competent 
ophthalmologists, and three novice ophthalmologists) read images in each of the 
conditions: unassisted, AI-assisted, or XAI-assisted. In unassisted condition, 
only the original IVCM images were shown to the readers. AI assistance comprised 
a histogram of model prediction probability. For XAI assistance, explanatory 
maps were additionally shown. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were 
calculated against an adjudicated reference standard. Moreover, the time spent 
was measured. Results: Both forms of algorithmic assistance increased the 
accuracy and sensitivity of competent and novice ophthalmologists significantly 
without reducing specificity. The improvement was more pronounced in 
XAI-assisted condition than that in AI-assisted condition. Time spent with XAI 
assistance was not significantly different from that without assistance. 
Conclusion: AI has shown great promise in improving the accuracy of 
ophthalmologists. The inexperienced readers are more likely to benefit from the 
XAI system. With better interpretability and explainability, XAI-assistance can 
boost ophthalmologist performance beyond what is achievable by the reader alone 
or with black-box AI assistance.

Background and Aims: To investigate the impact of the computer-assisted system 
on esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) training for novice trainees in a 
prospective randomized controlled trial. Methods: We have constructed a 
computer-aided system (CAD) using retrospective images based on deep learning 
which could automatically monitor the 26 anatomical landmarks of the upper 
digestive tract and document standard photos. Six novice trainees were allocated 
and grouped into the CAD group and control group. Each of them took the training 
course, pre and post-test, and EGD examination scored by two experts. The CAD 
group was trained with the assistance of the CAD system and the control group 
without. Results: Both groups achieved great improvements in EGD skills. The CAD 
group received a higher examination grading score in the EGD examination (72.83 
± 16.12 vs. 67.26 ± 15.64, p = 0.039), especially in the mucosa observation 
(26.40 ± 6.13 vs. 24.11 ± 6.21, p = 0.020) and quality of collected images (7.29 
± 1.09 vs. 6.70 ± 1.05). The CAD showed a lower blind spot rate (2.19 ± 2.28 vs. 
3.92 ± 3.30, p = 0.008) compared with the control group. Conclusion: The 
artificial intelligence assistant system displayed assistant capacity on 
standard EGD training, and assisted trainees in achieving a learning curve with 
high operation quality, which has great potential for application. Clinical 
Trial Registration: This trial is registered at https:/clinicaltrials.gov/, 
number NCT04682821.

Mobile application (app) use is increasingly becoming an essential part of our 
daily lives. Due to their significant usefulness, people rely on them to perform 
multiple tasks seamlessly in almost all aspects of everyday life. Similarly, 
there has been immense progress in artificial intelligence (AI) technology, 
especially deep learning, computer vision, natural language processing, and 
robotics. These technologies are now actively being implemented in smartphone 
apps and healthcare, providing multiple healthcare services. However, several 
factors affect the usefulness of mobile healthcare apps, and usability is an 
important one. There are various healthcare apps developed for each specific 
task, and the success of these apps depends on their performance. This study 
presents a systematic review of the existing apps and discusses their usability 
attributes. It highlights the usability models, outlines, and guidelines 
proposed in previous research for designing apps with improved usability 
characteristics. Thirty-nine research articles were reviewed and examined to 
identify the usability attributes, framework, and app design conducted. The 
results showed that satisfaction, efficiency, and learnability are the most 
important usability attributes to consider when designing eHealth mobile apps. 
Surprisingly, other significant attributes for healthcare apps, such as privacy 
and security, were not among the most indicated attributes in the studies.

Objective. The mainstream development trend in the era of intelligent sports. At 
present, with the rapid development of science and technology, it is absolutely 
wise to combine group intelligence with community intelligent sports services 
for the elderly. Group intelligence has opened a new era of intelligent sports 
service. Group intelligence has become an important factor in the development 
and growth of community intelligent sports service for the elderly and has 
become a hot topic at present. However, intelligence has encountered 
difficulties on the road of development. At present, the aging of the population 
is getting worse and worse, and the elderly have higher and higher requirements 
for fitness and leisure services, which leads to the need for sports services to 
be continuously strengthened. The distribution of resources is uneven, the data 
is not clear enough, and the swarm intelligence algorithm is not perfect. With 
the adaptation of the elderly to intelligence, more intelligent, concise, and 
personalized services need to be developed. The most important method is to 
optimize the swarm intelligence algorithm continuously. In this paper, PSO 
algorithm is optimized and HCSSPSO algorithm is proposed. HCSSPSO algorithm is a 
combination of PSO algorithm and clonal selection strategy, and test simulation 
experiments, PSO algorithm, CLPSO algorithm, and HCSSPSO algorithm for 
comparison. From the experimental results, HCSSPSO algorithm has better 
convergence speed and stability, whether it is data or comparison graph. The 
data optimized by HCSSPSO algorithm is higher than the original data and the 
other two algorithms in terms of satisfaction and resource allocation.

The purpose of this study was to perform a comparative analysis of traditional 
nursing techniques and autonomous robotic applications used for managing 
patients with advanced stages of dementia. PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and 
WILEY databases were searched for relevant articles concerning nursing 
techniques applied in the treatment of patients with advanced dementia. The 
search terms included: (advanced dementia OR severe dementia) AND [artificial 
intelligence (AI) OR robotic OR robots OR neural networks OR deep learning OR 
automated procedures OR autonomous application]. This search identified a total 
of 2,679 articles and 298 articles were selected. Finally, 23 articles were 
included in this systematic review, out of which 8 studies analyzed traditional 
nursing techniques and 15 studies analyzed autonomous robotic applications. 
Significant evidence was revealed, demonstrating that autonomous robotic 
applications used for patients with advanced stages of dementia are a feasible, 
cost-efficient solution and represent an excellent benefit for patients and the 
healthcare system.

This study was aimed at exploring the treatment of asthma children with small 
airway obstruction in CT imaging features of deep learning and glucocorticoid. A 
total of 145 patients meeting the requirements in hospital were included in this 
study, and they were randomly assigned to receive aerosolized glucocorticoid (n 
= 45), aerosolized glucocorticoid combined with bronchodilator (n = 50), or oral 
steroids (n = 50) for 4 weeks after discharge. The lung function and fractional 
exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) indexes of the three groups were measured, 
respectively, and then the effective rates were compared to evaluate the 
clinical efficacy of glucocorticoids with different administration methods and 
combined medications in the short-term maintenance treatment after acute 
exacerbation of asthma. Deep learning algorithm was used for CT image 
segmentation. The CT image is sent to the workbench for processing on the 
workbench, and then the convolution operation is performed on each input pixel 
point during the image processing. After 4 weeks of maintenance treatment, FEF50 
%, FEF75 %, and MMEF75/25 increased significantly, and FENO decreased 
significantly (P < 0.01). The improvement results of FEF50 %, FEF75 %, 
MMEF75/25, and FENO after maintenance treatment were as follows: the oral 
hormone group was the most effective, followed by the combined atomization 
inhalation group, and the hormone atomization inhalation group was the least 
effective. The differences among them were statistically significant (P < 0.05). 
The accuracy of artificial intelligence segmentation algorithm was 81%. All the 
hormones were more effective than local medication in the treatment of small 
airway function and airway inflammation. In the treatment of aerosol inhalation, 
the hormone combined with bronchiectasis drug was the most effective in 
improving small airway obstruction and reducing airway inflammation compared 
with single drug inhalation. Deep learning CT images are simple, noninvasive, 
and intuitively observe lung changes in asthma with small airway functional 
obstruction. Asthma with small airway functional obstruction has high clinical 
diagnosis and evaluation value.

Measuring whole brain networks is a promising approach to extract features of 
autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a brain disorder of widespread regions. 
Objectives of this study were to evaluate properties of resting-state functional 
brain networks in children with and without ASD and to evaluate their relation 
with social impairment severity. Magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data were 
recorded for 21 children with ASD (7 girls, 60-89 months old) and for 25 
typically developing (TD) control children (10 girls, 60-91 months old) in a 
resting state while gazing at a fixation cross. After signal sources were 
localized onto the Desikan-Killiany brain atlas, statistical relations between 
localized activities were found and evaluated in terms of the phase lag index. 
After brain networks were constructed and after matching with intelligence using 
a coarsened exact matching algorithm, ASD and TD graph theoretical measures were 
compared. We measured autism symptoms severity using the Social Responsiveness 
Scale and investigated its relation with altered small-worldness using linear 
regression models. Children with ASD were found to have significantly lower 
small-worldness in the beta band (p = 0.007) than TD children had. Lower 
small-worldness in the beta band of children with ASD was associated with higher 
Social Responsiveness Scale total t-scores (p = 0.047). Significant relations 
were also inferred for the Social Awareness (p = 0.008) and Social Cognition (p 
= 0.015) sub-scales. Results obtained using graph theory demonstrate a 
difference between children with and without ASD in MEG-derived resting-state 
functional brain networks, and the relation of that difference with social 
impairment. Combining graph theory and MEG might be a promising approach to 
establish a biological marker for ASD.

Emotions as Abstract Evaluation Criteria in Biological and Artificial 
Intelligences.

Gros C(1).

Author information:
(1)Institute for Theoretical Physics, Goethe University Frankfurt am Main, 
Frankfurt, Germany.

Biological as well as advanced artificial intelligences (AIs) need to decide 
which goals to pursue. We review nature's solution to the time allocation 
problem, which is based on a continuously readjusted categorical weighting 
mechanism we experience introspectively as emotions. One observes 
phylogenetically that the available number of emotional states increases hand in 
hand with the cognitive capabilities of animals and that raising levels of 
intelligence entail ever larger sets of behavioral options. Our ability to 
experience a multitude of potentially conflicting feelings is in this view not a 
leftover of a more primitive heritage, but a generic mechanism for attributing 
values to behavioral options that can not be specified at birth. In this view, 
emotions are essential for understanding the mind. For concreteness, we propose 
and discuss a framework which mimics emotions on a functional level. Based on 
time allocation via emotional stationarity (TAES), emotions are implemented as 
abstract criteria, such as satisfaction, challenge and boredom, which serve to 
evaluate activities that have been carried out. The resulting timeline of 
experienced emotions is compared with the "character" of the agent, which is 
defined in terms of a preferred distribution of emotional states. The long-term 
goal of the agent, to align experience with character, is achieved by optimizing 
the frequency for selecting individual tasks. Upon optimization, the statistics 
of emotion experience becomes stationary.

Update of
    Res Sq. 2021 Jul 20;:

Diagnostic tests that detect antibodies (AB) against SARS-CoV-2 for evaluation 
of seroprevalence and guidance of health care measures are important tools for 
managing the COVID-19 pandemic. Current tests have certain limitations with 
regard to turnaround time, costs and availability, particularly in point-of-care 
(POC) settings. We established a hemagglutination-based AB test that is based on 
bi-specific proteins which contain a dromedary-derived antibody (nanobody) 
binding red blood cells (RBD) and a SARS-CoV-2-derived antigen, such as the 
receptor-binding domain of the Spike protein (Spike-RBD). While the nanobody 
mediates swift binding to RBC, the antigen moiety directs instantaneous, 
visually apparent hemagglutination in the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific AB 
generated in COVID-19 patients or vaccinated individuals. Method comparison 
studies with assays cleared by emergency use authorization demonstrate high 
specificity and sensitivity. To further increase objectivity of test 
interpretation, we developed an image analysis tool based on digital image 
acquisition (via a cell phone) and a machine learning algorithm based on defined 
sample-training and -validation datasets. Preliminary data, including a small 
clinical study, provides proof of principle for test performance in a POC 
setting. Together, the data support the interpretation that this AB test format, 
which we refer to as 'NanoSpot.ai', is suitable for POC testing, can be 
manufactured at very low costs and, based on its generic mode of action, can 
likely be adapted to a variety of other pathogens.

OBJECTIVE: Given the complexities of testing the translational capability of new 
artificial intelligence (AI) tools, we aimed to map the pathways of 
training/validation/testing in development process and external validation of AI 
tools evaluated in dedicated randomised controlled trials (AI-RCTs).
METHODS: We searched for peer-reviewed protocols and completed AI-RCTs 
evaluating the clinical effectiveness of AI tools and identified development and 
validation studies of AI tools. We collected detailed information, and evaluated 
patterns of development and external validation of AI tools.
RESULTS: We found 23 AI-RCTs evaluating the clinical impact of 18 unique AI 
tools (2009-2021). Standard-of-care interventions were used in the control arms 
in all but one AI-RCT. Investigators did not provide access to the software code 
of the AI tool in any of the studies. Considering the primary outcome, the 
results were in favour of the AI intervention in 82% of the completed AI-RCTs 
(14 out of 17). We identified significant variation in the patterns of 
development, external validation and clinical evaluation approaches among 
different AI tools. A published development study was found only for 10 of the 
18 AI tools. Median time from the publication of a development study to the 
respective AI-RCT was 1.4 years (IQR 0.2-2.2).
CONCLUSIONS: We found significant variation in the patterns of development and 
validation for AI tools before their evaluation in dedicated AI-RCTs. Published 
peer-reviewed protocols and completed AI-RCTs were also heterogeneous in design 
and reporting. Upcoming guidelines providing guidance for the development and 
clinical translation process aim to improve these aspects.

BACKGROUND: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) are performed routinely for lung 
cancer screening. However, a large amount of nonpulmonary data from these scans 
remains unassessed. We aimed to validate a deep learning model to automatically 
segment and measure left atrial (LA) volumes from routine NCCT and evaluate 
prediction of cardiovascular outcomes.
METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 273 patients (median age 69 years, 55.5% 
male) who underwent LDCT for lung cancer screening. LA volumes were quantified 
by three expert cardiothoracic radiologists and a prototype AI algorithm. LA 
volumes were then indexed to the body surface area (BSA). Expert and AI LA 
volume index (LAVi) were compared and used to predict cardiovascular outcomes 
within five years. Logistic regression with appropriate univariate statistics 
were used for modelling outcomes.
RESULTS: There was excellent correlation between AI and expert results with an 
LAV intraclass correlation of 0.950 (0.936-0.960). Bland-Altman plot 
demonstrated the AI underestimated LAVi by a mean 5.86 ​mL/m2. AI-LAVi was 
associated with new-onset atrial fibrillation (AUC 0.86; OR 1.12, 95% CI 
1.08-1.18, p ​< ​0.001), HF hospitalization (AUC 0.90; OR 1.07, 95% CI 
1.04-1.13, p ​< ​0.001), and MACCE (AUC 0.68; OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.07, 
p ​= ​0.01).
CONCLUSION: This novel deep learning algorithm for automated measurement of LA 
volume on lung cancer screening scans had excellent agreement with manual 
quantification. AI-LAVi is significantly associated with increased risk of 
new-onset atrial fibrillation, HF hospitalization, and major adverse cardiac and 
cerebrovascular events within 5 years.

RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To assess key trends, strengths, and gaps in 
validation studies of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-regulated 
imaging-based artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) algorithms.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We audited publicly available details of regulated AI/ML 
algorithms in imaging from 2008 until April 2021. We reviewed 127 regulated 
software (118 AI/ML) to classify information related to their parent company, 
subspecialty, body area and specific anatomy type, imaging modality, date of FDA 
clearance, indications for use, target pathology (such as trauma) and findings 
(such as fracture), technique (CAD triage, CAD detection and/or 
characterization, CAD acquisition or improvement, and image 
processing/quantification), product performance, presence, type, strength and 
availability of clinical validation data. Pertaining to validation data, where 
available, we recorded the number of patients or studies included, sensitivity, 
specificity, accuracy, and/or receiver operating characteristic area under the 
curve, along with information on ground-truthing of use-cases. Data were 
analyzed with pivot tables and charts for descriptive statistics and trends.
RESULTS: We noted an increasing number of FDA-regulated AI/ML from 2008 to 2021. 
Seventeen (17/118) regulated AI/ML algorithms posted no validation claims or 
data. Just 9/118 reviewed AI/ML algorithms had a validation dataset sizes of 
over 1000 patients. The most common type of AI/ML included image 
processing/quantification (IPQ; n = 59/118), and triage (CADt; n = 27/118). 
Brain, breast, and lungs dominated the targeted body regions of interest.
CONCLUSION: Insufficient public information on validation datasets in several 
FDA-regulated AI/ML algorithms makes it difficult to justify clinical 
applications since their generalizability and presence of bias cannot be 
inferred.

The Microorganism Detection System (SDM) is a new solution using artificial 
intelligence, unique on the international scale, to correctly identify and count 
microorganisms, with particular emphasis on specificlisted microorganisms 
(Document of Standard PN-EN ISO 17516-2014:11) - Candida albicans, Escherichia 
coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus. SDM enables the use of 
algorithms for microscopic image interpretation in the microbiological 
assessment of the cosmetics in accordance with the standard, providing an answer 
to whether the tested product complies with the standard. Apart from the 
software part of SDM, an integral part of the system is an innovative 
methodology for preparing a cosmetic sample for testing. The experiments confirm 
the high sensitivity and specificity of the SDM method, its repeatability and, 
above all, the comparability of the results with the methods of European 
standards.

INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: The article presents the methodology of preparing a 
cosmetic sample for analysi, and the creation of a dataset for teaching 
artificial intelligence to recognize specific species of microorganisms in 
cosmetic samples in terms of compliance with the ISO standard document, to 
develop of the Microorganism Detection System (SDM).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Methodology of preparation a cosmetic sample for testing 
covers the steps from taking a cosmetic sample to obtaining separated living 
microorganisms through staining to photos, which in the final stage are used for 
analysis of the purity of cosmetics by SDM, as well as for learning and testing 
of the deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for detecting and classifying 
cells of specific species of bacteria, fungi and yeast in cosmetics, according 
to the document of standard PN-EN ISO 17516-2014:11.
RESULTS: A new techique was devised for preparing a cosmetic sample for the 
development of Microorganism Detection System (SDM) software, and artificial 
intelligence learning to recognize specific microbial species. Based on metod 
demonstrated, the Intelligent algorithms of SDM proved to be effective in 
counting and recognizing specific microorganisms (average accuracy for Candida 
albicans - 97%, Escherichia coli - 76%, Pseudomonas aeruginosa - 70%, 
Staphylococcus aureus - 85%), which are the most important species for the 
assessment of the purity of cosmetics. In addition, the reproducibility of the 
developed method was verified, and the results obtained were comparable to the 
breeding methods currently used, based on specific standards.
CONCLUSIONS: The experiments confirmed the high sensitivity and specificity of 
the SDM method, its repeatability and, above all, the comparability of the 
results with clasic methods of European standards.

BACKGROUND: Although it has been 30 years since the first automation systems 
were introduced in the microbiology laboratory, total laboratory automation 
(TLA) has only recently been recognized as a valuable component of the 
laboratory. A growing number of publications illustrate the potential impact of 
automation. TLA can improve standardization, increase laboratory efficiency, 
increase workplace safety, and reduce long-term costs.
CONTENT: This review provides a preview of the current state of automation in 
clinical microbiology and covers the main developments during the last years. We 
describe the available hardware systems (that range from single function devices 
to multifunction workstations) and the challenging alterations on workflow and 
organization of the laboratory that have to be implemented to optimize 
automation.
SUMMARY: Despite the many advantages in efficiency, productivity, and timeliness 
that automation offers, it is not without new and unique challenges. For every 
advantage that laboratory automation provides, there are similar challenges that 
a laboratory must face. Change management strategies should be used to lead to a 
successful implementation. TLA represents, moreover, a substantial initial 
investment. Nevertheless, if properly approached, there are a number of 
important benefits that can be achieved through implementation of automation in 
the clinical microbiology laboratory. Future developments in the field of 
automation will likely focus on image analysis and artificial intelligence 
improvements. Patient care, however, should remain the epicenter of all future 
directions and there will always be a need for clinical microbiology expertise 
to interpret the complex clinical and laboratory information.

BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are poised to 
transform infectious disease testing. Uniquely, infectious disease testing is 
technologically diverse spaces in laboratory medicine, where multiple platforms 
and approaches may be required to support clinical decision-making. Despite 
advances in laboratory informatics, the vast array of infectious disease data is 
constrained by human analytical limitations. Machine learning can exploit 
multiple data streams, including but not limited to laboratory information and 
overcome human limitations to provide physicians with predictive and actionable 
results. As a quickly evolving area of computer science, laboratory 
professionals should become aware of AI/ML applications for infectious disease 
testing as more platforms are become commercially available.
CONTENT: In this review we: (a) define both AI/ML, (b) provide an overview of 
common ML approaches used in laboratory medicine, (c) describe the current AI/ML 
landscape as it relates infectious disease testing, and (d) discuss the future 
evolution AI/ML for infectious disease testing in both laboratory and 
point-of-care applications.
SUMMARY: The review provides an important educational overview of AI/ML 
technique in the context of infectious disease testing. This includes supervised 
ML approaches, which are frequently used in laboratory medicine applications 
including infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, sepsis, hepatitis, malaria, 
meningitis, Lyme disease, and tuberculosis. We also apply the concept of "data 
fusion" describing the future of laboratory testing where multiple data streams 
are integrated by AI/ML to provide actionable clinical knowledge.

Digital technology has been used in the field of diagnostic breast pathology and 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) for decades. Examples include automated tissue 
processing and staining, digital data processing, storing and management, voice 
recognition systems, and digital technology-based production of antibodies and 
other IHC reagents. However, the recent application of whole slide imaging 
technology and artificial intelligence (AI)-based tools has attracted a lot of 
attention. The use of AI tools in breast pathology is discussed briefly as it is 
covered in other reviews. Here, we present the main application of digital 
technology in IHC. This includes automation of IHC staining, using image 
analysis systems and computer vision technology to interpret IHC staining, and 
the use of AI-based tools to predict marker expression from haematoxylin and 
eosin-stained digitalized images.

The detection and identification of ignitable liquid (IL) residues in fire 
debris are two very challenging tasks in a fire investigation. To this day, the 
recognition of IL in fire debris includes the chemical analysis of the fire 
debris composition, followed by the examination and interpretation of the 
analysis result by a trained forensic examiner. Throughout the last decade, 
chemometrics and artificial intelligence have become increasingly important. In 
the present study, machine learning algorithms capable of recognizing gasoline 
residues in fire debris based on GC-MS data have been developed. Four methods, 
including random forest, gradient boosting, support vector machine, and naïve 
bayes are applied and used to classify fire debris samples into the two 
categories "with gasoline" or "without gasoline". A fifth method (logistic 
regression) did not converge due to well separated classes. A database 
comprising 360 measurements, including fire debris samples of real cases as well 
as fire debris samples spiked with known amounts of weathered gasoline (up to 
99.6%), was available to train the machine learning algorithms (using 85% of the 
data) and to subsequently test the performance of the methods when classifying 
unknown samples (using 15% of the data). In general, the methods perform very 
well, as three of it succeeded to classify all test samples correctly without 
any false positive or false negative allocations. One (naïve bayes) was not 
trained enough to classify other (non-gasoline) IL correctly as "no gasoline". 
Furthermore, the random forest method reveals which chemical compounds are most 
relevant for the algorithm to classify the samples. In general, the presented 
approach is highly promising and could easily be extended or adapted to other 
types of IL. Similar to the neural network presented in the accompanying paper, 
such methods have the potential to serve as a fast screening technique for fire 
debris samples, thus supporting the forensic examiner by providing an additional 
independent opinion. Nonetheless, the definite identification of IL residues in 
fire debris always has to be accomplished by a forensic examiner.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Artificial intelligence (AI) apps hold great potential 
to make pathological diagnoses more accurate and time efficient. Widespread use 
of AI in pathology is hampered by interface incompatibilities between pathology 
software. We studied the existing interfaces in order to develop the EMPAIA App 
Interface, an open standard for the integration of pathology AI apps.
METHODS: The EMPAIA App Interface relies on widely-used web communication 
protocols and containerization. It consists of three parts: A standardized 
format to describe the semantics of an app, a mechanism to deploy and execute 
apps in computing environments, and a web API through which apps can exchange 
data with a host application.
RESULTS: Five commercial AI app manufacturers successfully adapted their 
products to the EMPAIA App Interface and helped improve it with their feedback. 
Open source tools facilitate the adoption of the interface by providing reusable 
data access and scheduling functionality and enabling automatic validation of 
app compliance.
CONCLUSIONS: Existing AI apps and pathology software can be adapted to the 
EMPAIA App Interface with little effort. It is a viable alternative to the 
proprietary interfaces of current software. If enough vendors join in, the 
EMPAIA App Interface can help to advance the use of AI in pathology.

BACKGROUND: Alterations in the anatomic and biomechanical properties of the 
ascending aorta (AAo) can give rise to various vascular pathologies. The aim of 
the current study is to gain additional insights in the biology of the AAo size 
and function.
METHODS: We developed an AI based analysis pipeline for the segmentation of the 
AAo, and the extraction of AAO parameters. We then performed genome-wide 
association studies of AAo maximum area, AAo minimum area and AAo distensibility 
in up to 37,910 individuals from the UK Biobank. Variants that were 
significantly associated with AAo phenotypes were used as instrumental variables 
in Mendelian randomization analyses to investigate potential causal 
relationships with coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, stroke and 
aneurysms.
FINDINGS: Genome-wide association studies revealed a total of 107 SNPs in 78 
loci. We annotated 101 candidate genes involved in various biological processes, 
including connective tissue development (THSD4 and COL6A3). Mendelian 
randomization analyses showed a causal association with aneurysm development, 
but not with other vascular diseases.
INTERPRETATION: We identified 78 loci that provide insights into mechanisms 
underlying AAo size and function in the general population and provide genetic 
evidence for their role in aortic aneurysm development.

Medical process trace classification exploits the activity sequences logged by 
an healthcare organization to classify traces themselves on the basis of some 
performance properties; this information can be used for quality assessment. 
State-of-the-art process trace classification resorts to deep learning, a very 
powerful technique which however suffers from the lack of explainability. In 
this paper we aim at addressing this issue, motivated by a relevant application, 
i.e., the classification of process traces for quality assessment in stroke 
management. To this end we introduce the novel concept of trace saliency maps, 
an instrument able to highlight what trace activities are particularly 
significant for the classification task. Through trace saliency maps we justify 
the output of the deep learning architecture, and make it more easily 
interpretable to medical users. The good results in our use case have shown the 
feasibility of the approach, and let us make the hypothesis that it might be 
translated to other application settings and to other black box learners as 
well.

Neurotoxicology is a specialty that aims to understand and explain the impact of 
chemicals, xenobiotics and physical conditions on nervous system function 
throughout the life span. Herein, we point to the need for integration of novel 
translational bioinformatics and chemo-informatics approaches, such as machine 
learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) to the discipline. Specifically, 
we advance the notion that AI and ML will be helpful in identifying neurotoxic 
signatures, provide reliable data in predicting neurotoxicity in the context of 
genetic variability, and improve the understanding of neurotoxic outcomes 
associated with exposures to mixtures, to name a few.

The choroid plexus (ChP) is the center of soluble factor secretion into the 
cerebrospinal fluid in the central nervous system. It is known that various 
signaling factors secreted from the ChP are involved in the regulation of brain 
development and homeostasis. Intriguingly, the size of the ChP was prominently 
expanded in the brains of primates, including humans, suggesting that the 
expansion of the ChP contributed to mammalian brain evolution, leading to the 
acquisition of higher intelligence and cognitive functions. To address this 
hypothesis, we established transgenic (Tg) systems using regulatory elements 
that direct expression of candidate genes in the ChP. Overexpression of sonic 
hedgehog (Shh) in the developing ChP led to the expansion of the ChP with 
greater arborization. Shh produced in the ChP caused an increase in neural stem 
cells (NSCs) in the neocortical region, leading to the expansion of ventricles, 
ventricular zone and neocortical surface area, and neocortical surface folding. 
These findings suggest that the activation of Shh signaling via its enhanced 
secretion from the developing ChP contributed to the evolution of the neocortex. 
Furthermore, we found that Shh produced in the ChP enhanced NSC proliferation in 
the postnatal Tg brain, demonstrating that our Tg system can be used to estimate 
the effects of candidate factors secreted from the ChP on various aspects of 
brain morphogenesis and functions.

PURPOSE: We sought to automate R.E.N.A.L. (for radius, exophytic/endophytic, 
nearness of tumor to collecting system, anterior/posterior, location relative to 
polar line) nephrometry scoring of preoperative computerized tomography scans 
and create an artificial intelligence-generated score (AI-score). Subsequently, 
we aimed to evaluate its ability to predict meaningful oncologic and 
perioperative outcomes as compared to expert human-generated nephrometry scores 
(H-scores).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 300 patients with preoperative computerized 
tomography were identified from a cohort of 544 consecutive patients undergoing 
surgical extirpation for suspected renal cancer at a single institution. A deep 
neural network approach was used to automatically segment kidneys and tumors, 
and geometric algorithms were developed to estimate components of R.E.N.A.L. 
nephrometry score. Tumors were independently scored by medical personnel blinded 
to AI-scores. AI- and H-score agreement was assessed using Lin's concordance 
correlation and their predictive abilities for both oncologic and perioperative 
outcomes were assessed using areas under the curve.
RESULTS: Median age was 60 years (IQE 51-68), and 40% were female. Median tumor 
size was 4.2 cm and 91.3% had malignant tumors, including 27%, 37% and 24% with 
high stage, grade and necrosis, respectively. There was significant agreement 
between H-scores and AI-scores (Lin's ⍴=0.59). Both AI- and H-scores similarly 
predicted meaningful oncologic outcomes (p <0.001) including presence of 
malignancy, necrosis, and high-grade and -stage disease (p <0.003). They also 
predicted surgical approach (p <0.004) and specific perioperative outcomes (p 
<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Fully automated AI-generated R.E.N.A.L. scores are comparable to 
human-generated R.E.N.A.L. scores and predict a wide variety of meaningful 
patient-centered outcomes. This unambiguous artificial intelligence-based 
scoring is intended to facilitate wider adoption of the R.E.N.A.L. score.

Emotional intelligence, or the ability to perceive, understand, and regulate 
emotions, has been identified as a protective factor for one's adaptation. 
Measuring emotional intelligence using performance-based approach is thought to 
be objective and effective. However, performance-based emotional intelligence 
instruments for non-Western adolescents are rarely available. To facilitate 
research on emotional intelligence, the present study developed and validated 
the emotional intelligence test for adolescents (A-EIT) using a Chinese sample. 
Study 1 (N = 1,536) showed that emotional intelligence consists of three 
subabilities (i.e., emotion perception, emotion understanding, and emotion 
regulation) and identified eligible items for each subtest through exploratory 
factor analysis (EFA). Study 2 (N = 2,568) confirmed the three-factor structure 
and its measurement invariance across gender and age groups by (multiple-group) 
confirmatory factor analyses. Both the full test and its three subtests showed 
acceptable internal consistencies, and their scores increased with age and 
showed female advantage. Also, the A-EIT scores were significantly correlated 
with indicators related to emotional and cognitive skills (convergent validity) 
and were independent of personality (discriminant validity). Additionally, 
higher scores on the A-EIT were related to better intrapersonal, interpersonal, 
and academic adaption (criterion validity), as expected. Study 3 (N = 163) 
provided further convergent validity evidence for each subtest by using validity 
tools not based on an emotional intelligence framework. Additionally, the A-EIT 
displayed satisfactory test-retest reliability. Generally, the A-EIT appears to 
be a valid and reliable instrument to assess adolescents' emotion intelligence, 
especially those with relatively low level. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021

The amygdala and the prefrontal cortex: The co-construction of intelligent 
decision-making.

Dixon ML(1), Dweck CS(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Psychology.

A revised view of the amygdala, its relationship with the prefrontal cortex 
(PFC), and its role in intelligent human decision-making is proposed. Based on 
recent findings, we present a framework in which the amygdala plays a central 
role in the value computations that determine which goals are worth pursuing, 
while the PFC plays a central role in generating and evaluating possible action 
plans to realize these goals. We suggest that the amygdala and PFC continuously 
work together during decision-making and goal pursuit as individuals compute and 
recompute the value and likelihood of different goals while interacting with a 
dynamic world. Once seen as chiefly involved in simple stimulus-outcome 
associative learning, the amygdala is shown to play a sophisticated role in 
human decision-making by contributing to the moment-by-moment integration of 
multiple costs and benefits to determine optimal choices. We discuss 
implications of the framework for brain development, emotion regulation, 
intelligence, and psychopathology. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all

The automation in the diagnosis of medical images is currently a challenging 
task. The use of Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems can be a powerful tool 
for clinicians, especially in situations when hospitals are overflowed. These 
tools are usually based on artificial intelligence (AI), a field that has been 
recently revolutionized by deep learning approaches. These alternatives usually 
obtain a large performance based on complex solutions, leading to a high 
computational cost and the need of having large databases. In this work, we 
propose a classification framework based on sparse coding. Images are first 
partitioned into different tiles, and a dictionary is built after applying PCA 
to these tiles. The original signals are then transformed as a linear 
combination of the elements of the dictionary. Then, they are reconstructed by 
iteratively deactivating the elements associated with each component. 
Classification is finally performed employing as features the subsequent 
reconstruction errors. Performance is evaluated in a real context where 
distinguishing between four different pathologies: control versus bacterial 
pneumonia versus viral pneumonia versus COVID-19. Our system differentiates 
between pneumonia patients and controls with an accuracy of 97.74%, whereas in 
the 4-class context the accuracy is 86.73%. The excellent results and the 
pioneering use of sparse coding in this scenario evidence that our proposal can 
assist clinicians when their workload is high.

The achievement of new bonding patterns of atoms in compounds is of great 
importance, which usually induces interesting physical and chemical properties. 
Rich oxidation states, diverse bonding types, and unique aurophilic attraction 
endow gold (Au) as a distinctive element. Here we report that a pressure-induced 
Li5AuP2, identified by a swarm intelligence-based structural prediction, becomes 
the first example of Au with sp3 hybridization. The most remarkable feature of 
Li5AuP2 is that it contains various frameworks made by AuP4, AuLi4, LiP4, and 
blende-like Li-P units, exhibiting noncentrosymmetry. The charge transfer from 
Li to Au makes Au 6p orbitals activate and hybridize with the 6s one. On the 
other hand, Li donating electrons to P and polar Au-P covalence make the 
constituent atoms satisfy the octet rule, rendering Li5AuP2 with a 
semiconducting character and a large second-order nonlinear optical response in 
the near-infrared region. Our work represents a significant step toward 
extending the understanding of gold chemistry.

OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the clinical impact of the Sim&Size® simulation 
software on the endovascular treatment with flow-diverter stents of patients 
with unruptured saccular intracranial aneurysms.
METHODS: This monocentric retrospective study evaluated a cohort of patients 
treated with flow-divert stents between June 1, 2014, and December 31, 2019, for 
cerebral aneurysms. Patients belonged to two groups, patients treated with and 
without the Sim&Size® simulation software. Univariate, bivariate, and 
multivariate analyses were used to evaluate the clinical impact of simulation 
software.
RESULTS: Out of the 73 interventions involving 68 patients analyzed by the 
study, 76.7% were simulated using the Sim&Size® simulation software, and 23.3% 
were not. Patients treated with the simulation software had shorter stent 
lengths (16.00 mm vs. 20.00 mm p-value = 0.001) and surgical time (100.00 min 
vs. 118.00 min p-value = 0.496). Also, fewer of them required more than one 
stent (3.6% vs. 17.6% p-value = 0.079). Three patients belonging to the 
non-stimulated group presented hemorrhagic complications.
CONCLUSIONS: Using the Sim&Size® simulation software for the endovascular 
treatment of intracranial aneurysms with pipeline flow-diverter stents reduces 
the stent length.

Photocatalytic water splitting is a promising method that uses sunlight to 
generate hydrogen from water to provide clean and renewable energy resources. 
Two-dimensional materials with abundant active sites are ideal candidates for 
achieving this goal; however, few of the known ones can meet the rigorous 
requirement of photocatalytic water splitting. By using first-principles 
swarm-intelligence search calculations, we have successfully identified two new 
semiconducting SiCP2 and SiCP4 monolayers. Their band-edge heights evidently 
straddle the redox potentials of water. For the more prominent SiCP4 monolayer, 
additional external biases of 0.32 V for water oxidation and 0.03 V for the 
hydrogen reduction half-reaction would be enough to drive its reaction sequences 
at pH 0, and it can spontaneously proceed to the water oxidation half-reaction 
in a neutral solution. Interestingly, the excellent optical absorbance ability 
(∼104 cm-1) and high carrier mobility (∼105 cm2 V-1 s-1) of SiCP2 and SiCP4 
facilitate the utilization of sunlight and the fast transportation of 
photogenerated carriers. All of these properties make SiCP2 and SiCP4 monolayers 
promising candidates for applications in photocatalytic water splitting.

Big data (BD) and artificial intelligence (AI) have increasingly been used in 
neurocritical care. "BD" can be operationally defined as extremely large 
datasets that are so large and complex that they cannot be analyzed by using 
traditional statistical modeling. "AI" means the ability of machines to perform 
tasks similar to those performed by human intelligence. We present a brief 
overview of the most commonly applied AI techniques to perform BD analytics and 
discuss some of the recent promising examples in the field of neurocritical 
care. The latter include the following: cognitive motor dissociation in 
disorders of consciousness, hypoxic-ischemic injury following cardiac arrest, 
delayed cerebral ischemia and vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage, and 
monitoring of intracranial pressure. It is imperative that we develop 
multicenter collaborations to tackle BD. These collaborations will allow us to 
share data, combine predictive algorithms, and analyze multiple and cumulative 
sources of data retrospectively and prospectively. Once AI algorithms are 
validated at multiple centers, they should be tested in randomized controlled 
trials investigating their impact on clinical outcome. The neurocritical care 
community must work to ensure that AI incorporates standards to ensure fairness 
and health equity rather than reflect our biases present in our collective 
conscience.

The present paper aims at analyzing the topological content of the complex 
trajectories that weeder-autonomous robots follow in operation. We will prove 
that the topological descriptors of these trajectories are affected by the robot 
environment as well as by the robot state, with respect to maintenance 
operations. Most of existing methodologies enabling efficient diagnosis are 
based on the data analysis, and in particular on some statistical quantities 
derived from the data. The present work explores the use of an original approach 
that instead of analyzing quantities derived from the data, analyzes the "shape" 
of the data, that is, the time series topology based on the homology 
persistence. We will prove that this procedure is able to extract valuable 
patterns able to discriminate the trajectories that the robot follows depending 
on the particular patch in which it operates, as well as to differentiate the 
robot behavior before and after undergoing a maintenance operation. Even if it 
is a preliminary work, and it does not pretend to compare its performances with 
respect to other existing technologies, this work opens new perspectives in 
considering quite natural and simple descriptors based on the intrinsic 
information that data contains, with the aim of performing efficient diagnosis 
and prognosis.

OBJECTIVE: We used texture analysis and machine learning (ML) to classify small 
round cell malignant tumors (SRCMTs) and Non-SRCMTs of nasal and paranasal sinus 
on fat-suppressed T2 weighted imaging (Fs-T2WI).
MATERIALS: Preoperative MRI scans of 164 patients from 1 January 2018 to 1 
January 2021 diagnosed with SRCMTs and Non-SRCMTs were included in this study. A 
total of 271 features were extracted from each regions of interest. Datasets 
were randomly divided into two sets, including a training set (∼70%) and a test 
set (∼30%). The Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) and principal component 
analysis (PCA) methods were performed to reduce dimensions, and the Analysis of 
Variance (ANOVA), Kruskal-Wallis (KW), and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) 
and Relief were performed for feature selections. Classifications were performed 
using 10 ML classifiers. Results were evaluated using a leave one out 
cross-validation analysis.
RESULTS: We compared the AUC of all pipelines on the validation dataset with 
FeAture Explorer (FAE) software. The pipeline using a PCC dimension reduction, 
relief feature selection, and gaussian process (GP) classifier yielded the 
highest area under the curve (AUC) using 15 features. When the "one-standard 
error" rule was used, FAE also produced a simpler model with 13 features, 
including S(5,-5)SumAverg, S(3,0)InvDfMom, Skewness, WavEnHL_s-3, 
Horzl_GlevNonU, Horzl_RLNonUni, 135dr_GlevNonU, WavEnLL_s-3, Teta4, Teta2, 
S(5,5)DifVarnc, Perc.01%, and WavEnLH_s-2. The AUCs of the 
training/validation/test datasets were 1.000/0.965/0.979, and the accuracies, 
sensitivities, and specificities were 0.890, 0.880, and 0.920, respectively. The 
best algorithm was GP whose AUCs of the training/validation/test datasets by the 
two-dimensional reduction methods and four feature selection methods were 
greater than approximately 0.800. Especially, the AUCs of different datasets 
were greater than approximately 0.900 using the PCC, RFE/Relief, and GP 
algorithms.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the feasibility of combining artificial 
intelligence and the radiomics from Fs-T2WI to differentially diagnose SRCMTs 
and Non-SRCMTs. This non-invasive approach could be very promising in clinical 
oncology.

BACKGROUND: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has the similar curative effects to 
surgery, but RFA will lead to higher postoperative local recurrence rate. 
3D-CEUS is a minimally invasive examination method, which is used to analyze the 
sensitivity to postoperative recurrence in this study.
METHODS: The clinical data of 60 patients with liver cancer admitted to our 
hospital (February 2018-February 2020) were retrospectively analyzed. All 
patients were treated with RFA and were followed up with 3D-CEUS, MRI, and 
enhanced CT examination after surgery. The ROC curve was used to analyze the 
differences of different examination methods in judging postoperative 
recurrence.
RESULTS: For the 60 patients, 52 patients (86.7%) had a single lesion and 8 
patients (13.3%) had multiple lesions, with a total of 72 lesions. After RFA, 56 
lesions (77.8%) were completely inactivated and 16 lesions (22.2%) remained. 
Totally inactivated lesions were detected as follows: 51 (91.1%) by 3D-CEUS, 42 
(75.0%) by MRI, and 50 (89.3%) by enhanced CT. During a 2-year follow-up, a 
total of 26 recurrent lesions were detected, 24 (92.3%) by 3D-CEUS, 12 (46.2%) 
by MRI, and 25 (96.2%) by enhanced CT, indicating that the sensitivity of 
3D-CEUS and enhanced CT was obviously higher than that of MRI (P < 0.001), 
without conspicuous difference between sensitivity of 3D-CEUS and enhanced CT (P 
> 0.05).
CONCLUSION: As a new imaging examination method based on artificial 
intelligence, 3D-CEUS has a high sensitivity in patients with liver cancer who 
underwent RFA, which can effectively judge the recurrence after surgery and 
should be widely used in practice.

The excessive number of COVID-19 cases reported worldwide so far, supplemented 
by a high rate of false alarms in its diagnosis using the conventional 
polymerase chain reaction method, has led to an increased number of 
high-resolution computed tomography (CT) examinations conducted. The manual 
inspection of the latter, besides being slow, is susceptible to human errors, 
especially because of an uncanny resemblance between the CT scans of COVID-19 
and those of pneumonia, and therefore demands a proportional increase in the 
number of expert radiologists. Artificial intelligence-based computer-aided 
diagnosis of COVID-19 using the CT scans has been recently coined, which has 
proven its effectiveness in terms of accuracy and computation time. In this 
work, a similar framework for classification of COVID-19 using CT scans is 
proposed. The proposed method includes four core steps: (i) preparing a database 
of three different classes such as COVID-19, pneumonia, and normal; (ii) 
modifying three pretrained deep learning models such as VGG16, ResNet50, and 
ResNet101 for the classification of COVID-19-positive scans; (iii) proposing an 
activation function and improving the firefly algorithm for feature selection; 
and (iv) fusing optimal selected features using descending order serial approach 
and classifying using multiclass supervised learning algorithms. We demonstrate 
that once this method is performed on a publicly available dataset, this system 
attains an improved accuracy of 97.9% and the computational time is almost 34 
(sec).

Owing to the rapid development of information and communication technologies, 
such as the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and computer vision, in 
recent years, the concept of smart sports has been proposed. A pitch fatigue 
detection method that includes acquisition, analysis, quantification, 
aggregation, learning, and public layers for adaptive baseball learning is 
proposed herein. The learning determines the fatigue index of the pitcher based 
on the angle of the pitcher's elbow and back as the number of pitches increases. 
The coach uses this auxiliary information to avoid baseball injuries during 
baseball learning. Results show a test accuracy rate of 89.1%, indicating that 
the proposed method effectively provides reference information for adaptive 
baseball learning.

Dry weight (DW) is an important dialysis index for patients with end-stage renal 
disease. It can guide clinical hemodialysis. Brain natriuretic peptide, chest 
computed tomography image, ultrasound, and bioelectrical impedance analysis are 
key indicators (multisource information) for assessing DW. By these approaches, 
a trial-and-error method (traditional measurement method) is employed to assess 
DW. The assessment of clinician is time-consuming. In this study, we developed a 
method based on artificial intelligence technology to estimate patient DW. Based 
on the conventional radial basis function neural (RBFN) network, we propose a 
multiple Laplacian-regularized RBFN (MLapRBFN) model to predict DW of patient. 
Compared with other model and body composition monitor, our method achieves the 
lowest value (1.3226) of root mean square error. In Bland-Altman analysis of 
MLapRBFN, the number of out agreement interval is least (17 samples). MLapRBFN 
integrates multiple Laplace regularization terms, and employs an efficient 
iterative algorithm to solve the model. The ratio of out agreement interval is 
3.57%, which is lower than 5%. Therefore, our method can be tentatively applied 
for clinical evaluation of DW in hemodialysis patients.

The mitotic count (MC) is an important histological parameter for 
prognostication of malignant neoplasms. However, it has inter- and intraobserver 
discrepancies due to difficulties in selecting the region of interest (MC-ROI) 
and in identifying or classifying mitotic figures (MFs). Recent progress in the 
field of artificial intelligence has allowed the development of high-performance 
algorithms that may improve standardization of the MC. As algorithmic 
predictions are not flawless, computer-assisted review by pathologists may 
ensure reliability. In the present study, we compared partial (MC-ROI 
preselection) and full (additional visualization of MF candidates and display of 
algorithmic confidence values) computer-assisted MC analysis to the routine 
(unaided) MC analysis by 23 pathologists for whole-slide images of 50 canine 
cutaneous mast cell tumors (ccMCTs). Algorithmic predictions aimed to assist 
pathologists in detecting mitotic hotspot locations, reducing omission of MFs, 
and improving classification against imposters. The interobserver consistency 
for the MC significantly increased with computer assistance (interobserver 
correlation coefficient, ICC = 0.92) compared to the unaided approach (ICC = 
0.70). Classification into prognostic stratifications had a higher accuracy with 
computer assistance. The algorithmically preselected hotspot MC-ROIs had a 
consistently higher MCs than the manually selected MC-ROIs. Compared to a ground 
truth (developed with immunohistochemistry for phosphohistone H3), pathologist 
performance in detecting individual MF was augmented when using computer 
assistance (F1-score of 0.68 increased to 0.79) with a reduction in false 
negatives by 38%. The results of this study demonstrate that computer assistance 
may lead to more reproducible and accurate MCs in ccMCTs.

Health professions education as a discipline: Evidence based on Krishnan's 
framework.

Blouin D(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Emergency Medicine, Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada.

Health professions education (HPE) emerged as a specific domain of higher 
education in the 1960s. The interim decades brought the development of advanced 
training in health professions education and the implementation of HPE offices 
at many institutions of healthcare and education across the world. Despite these 
advancements, organizations considering the establishment of HPE offices, or 
advanced HPE training programs are still challenged by approving authorities to 
demonstrate that HPE is a discipline and not simply a branch of higher 
education. Although other scholars have proposed defined characteristics to 
guide the recognition of study fields as separate academic disciplines, 
Krishnan's framework is easily operationalized and its use has been broadly 
reported in the management, education, and intelligence studies literature, 
among others. Krishnan contends that an academic discipline generally presents 
the following characteristics: (1) an object of study and research that, 
although particular to the discipline, can be common to others; (2) a body of 
specialized knowledge, relative to the subject of study and research, typically 
unique to the discipline; (3) theories and concepts that frame and organize the 
specialized knowledge of the discipline; (4) specific terminologies or technical 
language related to the subject of study and research; (5) research methods 
adapted to the particular demands of the discipline; and (6) an institutional 
presence demonstrated by teaching at the graduate level of subjects specific to 
the discipline, and by the existence of academic departments and professional 
associations. The purpose of this paper is to present arguments in support of 
the status of HPE as an academic discipline using Krishnan's framework. It is 
our hope that these arguments will facilitate the efforts of organizations 
planning for the establishment of HPE offices or advanced HPE training programs 
at their institutions.

IMPORTANCE: Most early lung cancers present as pulmonary nodules on imaging, but 
these can be easily missed on chest radiographs.
OBJECTIVE: To assess if a novel artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm can help 
detect pulmonary nodules on radiographs at different levels of detection 
difficulty.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This diagnostic study included 100 
posteroanterior chest radiograph images taken between 2000 and 2010 of adult 
patients from an ambulatory health care center in Germany and a lung image 
database in the US. Included images were selected to represent nodules with 
different levels of detection difficulties (from easy to difficult), and 
comprised both normal and nonnormal control.
EXPOSURES: All images were processed with a novel AI algorithm, the AI Rad 
Companion Chest X-ray. Two thoracic radiologists established the ground truth 
and 9 test radiologists from Germany and the US independently reviewed all 
images in 2 sessions (unaided and AI-aided mode) with at least a 1-month washout 
period.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Each test radiologist recorded the presence of 5 
findings (pulmonary nodules, atelectasis, consolidation, pneumothorax, and 
pleural effusion) and their level of confidence for detecting the individual 
finding on a scale of 1 to 10 (1 representing lowest confidence; 10, highest 
confidence). The analyzed metrics for nodules included sensitivity, specificity, 
accuracy, and receiver operating characteristics curve area under the curve 
(AUC).
RESULTS: Images from 100 patients were included, with a mean (SD) age of 55 (20) 
years and including 64 men and 36 women. Mean detection accuracy across the 9 
radiologists improved by 6.4% (95% CI, 2.3% to 10.6%) with AI-aided 
interpretation compared with unaided interpretation. Partial AUCs within the 
effective interval range of 0 to 0.2 false positive rate improved by 5.6% (95% 
CI, -1.4% to 12.0%) with AI-aided interpretation. Junior radiologists saw 
greater improvement in sensitivity for nodule detection with AI-aided 
interpretation as compared with their senior counterparts (12%; 95% CI, 4% to 
19% vs 9%; 95% CI, 1% to 17%) while senior radiologists experienced similar 
improvement in specificity (4%; 95% CI, -2% to 9%) as compared with junior 
radiologists (4%; 95% CI, -3% to 5%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this diagnostic study, an AI algorithm was 
associated with improved detection of pulmonary nodules on chest radiographs 
compared with unaided interpretation for different levels of detection 
difficulty and for readers with different experience.

BACKGROUND: Iron plays a role in many key processes in the developing brain. 
During pregnancy, iron supplementation is widely recommended to prevent and 
treat iron deficiency; however, the prevalence of iron deficiency and the risk 
of iron overload vary greatly between populations. Evidence on the role of high 
levels of maternal ferritin, a storage iron marker during pregnancy in relation 
to offspring neurodevelopment is lacking.
OBJECTIVE: Our main objective was to examine if maternal ferritin levels during 
pregnancy are associated with child cognitive and motor abilities.
METHODS: We included Dutch mother-child dyads from the prospective 
population-based Generation R Study, born in 2002-2006. We compared children 
whose mothers had high (standard deviation score >+1) or low (standard deviation 
score <-1) early-pregnancy ferritin to children whose mothers had intermediate 
ferritin (reference group) using linear regression. Children underwent 
non-verbal intelligence and language tests at 4-9 years (cognitive abilities), 
finger-tapping and balancing tests at 8-12 years (motor abilities), and 
structural magnetic resonance imaging at 8-12 years (brain morphology). 
Covariates were child age, sex, maternal intelligence quotient estimate, age, 
body-mass-index, education, parity, smoking and alcohol use.
RESULTS: Of the 2479 mother-child dyads with data on maternal ferritin and at 
least one child neurodevelopmental outcome, 387 mothers had low 
(mean = 20.6 µg/L), 1700 intermediate (mean = 64.6 µg/L) and 392 high 
(mean = 170.3 µg/L) early-pregnancy ferritin. High maternal ferritin was 
associated with 2.54 points (95% confidence interval -4.16, -0.92) lower child 
intelligence quotient and 16.02 cm3 (95% confidence interval -30.57, -1.48) 
smaller brain volume. Results remained similar after excluding mothers with high 
C-reactive protein. Low maternal ferritin was not associated with child 
cognitive abilities. Maternal ferritin was unrelated to child motor outcomes.
CONCLUSION: High maternal ferritin during pregnancy was associated with poorer 
child cognitive abilities and smaller brain volume. Maternal iron status during 
pregnancy may be associated with offspring neurodevelopment.

OBJECTIVES: B-lines are ultrasound artifacts that can be used to detect a 
variety of pathologic lung conditions. Computer-aided methods to detect and 
quantify B-lines may standardize quantification and improve diagnosis by novice 
users. We sought to test the performance of an automated algorithm for the 
detection and quantification of B-lines in a handheld ultrasound device (HHUD).
METHODS: Ultrasound images were prospectively collected on adult emergency 
department patients with dyspnea. Images from the first 124 patients were used 
for algorithm development. Clips from 80 unique subjects for testing were 
randomly selected in a predefined proportion of B-lines (0 B-lines, 1-2 B-lines, 
3 or more B-lines) and blindly reviewed by five experts using both a manual and 
reviewer-adjusted process. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and weighted 
kappa were used to measure agreement, while an a priori threshold of an ICC 
(3,k) of 0.75 and precision of 0.3 were used to define adequate performance.
RESULTS: ICC between the algorithm and manual count was 0.84 (95% confidence 
interval [CI] 0.75-0.90), with a precision of 0.15. ICC between the 
reviewer-adjusted count and the algorithm count was 0.94 (95% CI 0.90-0.96), and 
the ICC between the manual and reviewer-adjusted counts was 0.94 (95% CI 
0.90-0.96). Weighted kappa was 0.72 (95% CI 0.49-0.95), 0.88 (95% CI 0.74-1), 
and 0.85 (95% CI 0.89-0.96), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a high correlation between point-of-care 
ultrasound experts and an automated algorithm to identify and quantify B-lines 
using an HHUD. Future research may incorporate this HHUD in clinical studies in 
multiple settings and users of varying experience levels.

Soft actuators with apparent uniqueness in exhibiting complex shape morphing are 
highly desirable for artificial intelligence applications. However, for the 
majority of soft actuators, in general, it is challenging to achieve 
versatility, durability, and configurability simultaneously. Enormous works are 
devoted to meet the multifunctional smart actuators, to little effect. Herein, 
self-healing and bio-mimetic smart actuators are proposed based on azobenzene 
chromophores and dynamic disulfide bonds. Benefiting from the dynamic and 
drivable vitrimer liquid crystal elastomer (V-LCE) materials, a series of 
actuators with single or compound dynamic three-dimensional structures were 
fabricated, which were capable of double-stimuli response and complex "bionic" 
motions, such as the blooming of a flower, grasping and loosening an object, and 
so forth. Moreover, these flexible actuators showed fascinating properties, such 
as high robustness, excellent elasticity-plasticity shape-memory properties (Rf 
and Rr are close to 100%), easily reconfigurable property, and self-healing. 
This smart V-LCE provides a guideline to design and fabricate soft versatility 
actuators, which has prospects for developing smart bionic and artificial 
intelligence devices.

As a crucial biophysical property, red blood cell (RBC) deformability is 
pathologically altered in numerous disease states, and biochemical and 
structural changes occur over time in stored samples of otherwise normal RBCs. 
However, there is still a gap in applying it further to point-of-care blood 
devices due to the large external equipment (high-resolution microscope and 
microfluidic pump), associated operational difficulties, and professional 
analysis. Herein, we revolutionarily propose a smart optofluidic system to 
provide a differential diagnosis for blood testing via precise cell biophysics 
property recognition both mechanically and morphologically. Deformation of the 
RBC population is caused by pressing the hydrogel via an integrated mechanical 
transfer device. The biophysical properties of the cell population are obtained 
by the designed smartphone algorithm. Artificial intelligence-based modeling of 
cell biophysics properties related to blood diseases and quality was developed 
for online testing. We currently achieve 100% diagnostic accuracy for five 
typical clinical blood diseases (90 megaloblastic anemia, 78 myelofibrosis, 84 
iron deficiency anemia, 48 thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and 48 
thalassemias) via real-world prospective implementation; furthermore, 
personalized blood quality (for transfusion in cardiac surgery) monitoring is 
achieved with an accuracy of 96.9%. This work suggests a potential basis for 
next-generation blood smart health care devices.

In clinical diagnostics and research involving histopathology, formalin-fixed 
paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue is almost universally favored for its superb 
image quality. However, tissue processing time (>24 h) can slow decision-making. 
In contrast, fresh frozen (FF) processing (<1 h) can yield rapid information but 
diagnostic accuracy is suboptimal due to lack of clearing, morphologic 
deformation and more frequent artifacts. Here, we bridge this gap using 
artificial intelligence. We synthesize FFPE-like images ("virtual FFPE") from FF 
images using a generative adversarial network (GAN) from 98 paired kidney 
samples derived from 40 patients. Five board-certified pathologists evaluated 
the results in a blinded test. Image quality of the virtual FFPE data was 
assessed to be high and showed a close resemblance to real FFPE images. Clinical 
assessments of disease on the virtual FFPE images showed a higher inter-observer 
agreement compared to FF images. The nearly instantaneously generated virtual 
FFPE images can not only reduce time to information but can facilitate more 
precise diagnosis from routine FF images without extraneous costs and effort.

BACKGROUND: Earlier research has identified both synergistic and compensatory 
personality traits by intelligence interaction effects on academic performance.
METHODS: The present study employed data on intelligence, personality traits, 
and academic performance in the 1997 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 
(NLSY97, N = 8984).
RESULTS: Some intelligence by personality trait interaction effects, mainly 
involving indicators of dependability, on high school grades were identified. 
The interaction effects tended to be synergistic, meaning that the association 
between the trait and grades tended to strengthen with increased intelligence. A 
positive association between intelligence and the reliability in the measurement 
of a dependability composite score accounted for a substantial portion of the 
synergistic dependability by intelligence interaction effect on academic 
performance.
CONCLUSIONS: Personality trait by intelligence interaction effects on academic 
performance tend to be synergistic and may, at least to some degree, be due to a 
positive association between intelligence and reliability in the measurement of 
personality traits.

OBJECTIVE: Hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) are associated with significant 
morbidity, mortality, and prolonged hospital length of stay. Risk prediction 
models based on pre- and intraoperative data have been proposed to assess the 
risk of HAIs at the end of the surgery, but the performance of these models lag 
behind HAI detection models based on postoperative data. Postoperative data are 
more predictive than pre- or interoperative data since it is closer to the 
outcomes in time, but it is unavailable when the risk models are applied (end of 
surgery). The objective is to study whether such data, which is temporally 
unavailable at prediction time (TUP) (and thus cannot directly enter the model), 
can be used to improve the performance of the risk model.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: An extensive array of 12 methods based on logistic/linear 
regression and deep learning were used to incorporate the TUP data using a 
variety of intermediate representations of the data. Due to the hierarchical 
structure of different HAI outcomes, a comparison of single and multi-task 
learning frameworks is also presented.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The use of TUP data was always advantageous as baseline 
methods, which cannot utilize TUP data, never achieved the top performance. The 
relative performances of the different models vary across the different 
outcomes. Regarding the intermediate representation, we found that its 
complexity was key and that incorporating label information was helpful.
CONCLUSIONS: Using TUP data significantly helped predictive performance 
irrespective of the model complexity.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: A novel research field in bioinformatics is 
pharmacogenomics and the corresponding applications of artificial intelligence 
tools. Pharmacogenomics is the study of the relationship between genotype and 
responses to medical measures such as drug use. One of the most effective drugs 
is warfarin anticoagulant, but determining its initial treatment dose is 
challenging. Mistakes in the determination of the initial treatment dose can 
result directly in patient death.
METHODS: Some of the most successful techniques for estimating the initial 
treatment dose are kernel-based methods. However, all the available studies use 
pre-defined and constant kernels that might not necessarily address the 
problem's intended requirements. The present study seeks to define and present a 
new computational kernel extracted from a data set. This process aims to utilize 
all the data-related statistical features to generate a dose determination tool 
proportional to the data set with minimum error rate. The kernel-based version 
of the least square support vector regression estimator was defined. Through 
this method, a more appropriate approach was proposed for predicting the 
adjusted dose of warfarin.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: This paper benefits from the International Warfarin 
Pharmacogenomics Consortium (IWPC) Database. The results obtained in this study 
demonstrate that the support vector regression with the proposed new kernel can 
successfully estimate the ideal dosage of warfarin for approximately 68% of 
patients.

Deep learning approaches have produced substantial breakthroughs in fields such 
as image classification and natural language processing and are making rapid 
inroads in the area of protein design. Many generative models of proteins have 
been developed that encompass all known protein sequences, model specific 
protein families, or extrapolate the dynamics of individual proteins. Those 
generative models can learn protein representations that are often more 
informative of protein structure and function than hand-engineered features. 
Furthermore, they can be used to quickly propose millions of novel proteins that 
resemble the native counterparts in terms of expression level, stability, or 
other attributes. The protein design process can further be guided by 
discriminative oracles to select candidates with the highest probability of 
having the desired properties. In this review, we discuss five classes of 
generative models that have been most successful at modeling proteins and 
provide a framework for model guided protein design.

PURPOSE: The aim of this scoping review is to examine artificial intelligence 
(AI) and virtual teaching models within the context of dental education, 
establish methods to address the resources being investigated, and ultimately 
augment this approach for future scientific research.
METHODS: To evaluate the applications of AI and immersive technology, a scoping 
literature review was conducted using the Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, and 
Cochrane Library database from the years 2018 to May 19, 2021. Additionally, a 
manual search was completed. The search strategy was formulated according to the 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for 
Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. Studies that addressed the current uses 
of virtual devices and their revolutionary potential in dental education were 
categorized separately for further evaluation.
RESULTS:  Of the 2500 articles found in our initial search results, 31 articles 
met the inclusion criteria set for this review. The selected studies were 
directly related to AI and immersive tools in dental education.
CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, there are very few comprehensive literature 
reviews identifying the applications and efficacy of virtual and AI-driven tools 
in dental education. With limited verifiable evidence, an improved understanding 
of virtual and AI domains is needed to enable dental students to adapt to 
changes within and beyond their dental training education. To increase the 
scientific value of digital-related research, the scientific community must 
quickly define guidelines to enhance methodological approaches in order to 
effectively digitalize dentistry.

With the development and application of artificial intelligence, there is an 
appeal to the exploitation of various sensors and memories. As the most 
important perception of human beings, vision occupies more than 80% of all the 
received information. Inspired by biological eyes, an artificial retina based on 
2D Janus MoSSe was fabricated, which could simulate functions of visual 
perception with electronic/ion and optical comodulation. Furthermore, inspired 
by human brain, sensing, memory, and neuromorphic computing functions were 
integrated on one device for multifunctional intelligent electronics, which was 
beneficial for scalability and high efficiency. Through the formation of faradic 
electric double layer (EDL) at the metal-oxide/electrolyte interfaces could 
realize synaptic weight changes. On the basis of the optoelectronic 
performances, light adaptation of biological eyes, preprocessing, and 
recognition of handwritten digits were implemented successfully. This work may 
provide a strategy for the future integrated sensing-memory-processing device 
for optoelectronic artificial retina perception application.

Tomography-Computed Tomography Image Information Data Analysis for the 
Qualitative Diagnosis of Serous Cavity Effusion in Patients with Malignant 
Tumors.

This study aimed to investigate the application of positron emission tomography- 
(PET-) computed tomography (CT) image information data combined with serous 
cavity effusion based on clone selection artificial intelligence algorithm in 
the diagnosis of patients with malignant tumors. A total of 97 patients with 
PET-CT scanning and empirically confirmed as serous cavity effusion were 
retrospectively analyzed in this study. The clone selection artificial 
intelligence algorithm was applied to register the PET-CT images, and the 
patients were rolled into a benign effusion group and a malignant effusion group 
according to the benign and malignant conditions of the serous cavity effusion. 
Besides, the causes of patients from the two groups were analyzed, and there was 
a comparison of their physiological conditions. Subsequently, CT values of 
different KeV, lipid/water, water/iodine, and water/calcium concentrations were 
measured, and the differences of the above quantitative parameters between 
benign and malignant serous cavity effusion were compared, as well as the 
registration results of the clone algorithm. The results showed that the 
registration time and misalignment times of clonal selection algorithm (13.88, 
0) were lower than those of genetic algorithm (18.72, 8). There were marked 
differences in CT values of 40-60 keV and 130-140 keV between the two groups. 
The concentrations of lipid/water, water/iodine, and water/calcium in basal 
substances of the malignant effusion group were obviously higher than the 
concentrations of the benign effusion group (P < 0.05). Benign and malignant 
effusions presented different manifestations in PET-CT, which was conducive to 
the further diagnosis of malignant tumors. Based on clone selection artificial 
intelligence algorithm, PET-CT could provide a new multiparameter method for the 
identification of benign and malignant serous cavity effusions and benign and 
malignant tumors.

OBJECTIVE: Impaired empathy is a core feature of behavioral variant 
frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). Patients with bvFTD are also prominently 
impaired in experiencing self-conscious emotions. The investigators explored 
whether impaired empathy in bvFTD, such as self-conscious emotions, may result 
from impaired self-consciousness in social situations (socioemotional 
self-perception).
METHODS: This pilot study evaluated 25 patients with bvFTD and compared them 
with 25 patients with Alzheimer's disease who had comparable dementia severity. 
Their caregivers completed the Social Dysfunction Scale (SDS), which quantifies 
empathy, and an extensive intake interview that included questions regarding 
self-consciousness and insight. The patients completed two measures of 
self-perception in social situations, the Schutte Self-Report Emotional 
Intelligence Test (SSEIT) scale and the Embarrassability Scale (EMB).
RESULTS: Caregivers of patients with bvFTD, but not of patients with Alzheimer's 
disease, reported a high correlation between significantly decreased empathy 
(SDS) and decreased self-consciousness (intake interview questions). Consistent 
with lack of insight, the patients with bvFTD, unlike the patients with 
Alzheimer's disease, did not report decreases on the SSEIT and EMB measures.
CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings suggest that impaired socioemotional 
self-perception plays a role in the loss of empathy among patients with bvFTD. A 
lack of self-consciousness in social situations may contribute to a loss of 
empathy resulting from an inability to co-represent another's emotion in 
relation to oneself.

In a changing climate where future food security is a growing concern, 
researchers are exploring new methods and technologies in the effort to meet 
ambitious crop yield targets. The application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
including Machine Learning (ML) methods in this area has been proposed as a 
potential mechanism to support this. This review explores current research in 
the area to convey the state-of-the-art as to how AI/ML have been used to 
advance research, gain insights, and generally enable progress in this area. We 
address the question-Can AI improve crops and plant health? We further 
discriminate the bluster from the lustre by identifying the key challenges that 
AI has been shown to address, balanced with the potential issues with its usage, 
and the key requisites for its success. Overall, we hope to raise awareness and, 
as a result, promote usage, of AI related approaches where they can have 
appropriate impact to improve practices in agricultural and plant sciences.

Classification in Induction Motors.

Fault diagnosis and classification for machines are integral to condition 
monitoring in the industrial sector. However, in recent times, as sensor 
technology and artificial intelligence have developed, data-driven fault 
diagnosis and classification have been more widely investigated. The data-driven 
approach requires good-quality features to attain good fault classification 
accuracy, yet domain expertise and a fair amount of labeled data are important 
for better features. This paper proposes a deep auto-encoder (DAE) and 
convolutional neural network (CNN)-based bearing fault classification model 
using motor current signals of an induction motor (IM). Motor current signals 
can be easily and non-invasively collected from the motor. However, the current 
signal collected from industrial sources is highly contaminated with noise; 
feature calculation thus becomes very challenging. The DAE is utilized for 
estimating the nonlinear function of the system with the normal state data, and 
later, the residual signal is obtained. The subsequent CNN model then 
successfully classified the types of faults from the residual signals. Our 
proposed semi-supervised approach achieved very high classification accuracy 
(more than 99%). The inclusion of DAE was found to not only improve the accuracy 
significantly but also to be potentially useful when the amount of labeled data 
is small. The experimental outcomes are compared with some existing works on the 
same dataset, and the performance of this proposed combined approach is found to 
be comparable with them. In terms of the classification accuracy and other 
evaluation parameters, the overall method can be considered as an effective 
approach for bearing fault classification using the motor current signal.

Physiological measures, such as heart rate variability (HRV) and beats per 
minute (BPM), can be powerful health indicators of respiratory infections. HRV 
and BPM can be acquired through widely available wrist-worn biometric wearables 
and smartphones. Successive abnormal changes in these indicators could 
potentially be an early sign of respiratory infections such as COVID-19. Thus, 
wearables and smartphones should play a significant role in combating COVID-19 
through the early detection supported by other contextual data and artificial 
intelligence (AI) techniques. In this paper, we investigate the role of the 
heart measurements (i.e., HRV and BPM) collected from wearables and smartphones 
in demonstrating early onsets of the inflammatory response to the COVID-19. The 
AI framework consists of two blocks: an interpretable prediction model to 
classify the HRV measurements status (as normal or affected by inflammation) and 
a recurrent neural network (RNN) to analyze users' daily status (i.e., textual 
logs in a mobile application). Both classification decisions are integrated to 
generate the final decision as either "potentially COVID-19 infected" or "no 
evident signs of infection". We used a publicly available dataset, which 
comprises 186 patients with more than 3200 HRV readings and numerous user 
textual logs. The first evaluation of the approach showed an accuracy of 83.34 ± 
1.68% with 0.91, 0.88, 0.89 precision, recall, and F1-Score, respectively, in 
predicting the infection two days before the onset of the symptoms supported by 
a model interpretation using the local interpretable model-agnostic explanations 
(LIME).

The development of artificial intelligence and the Internet of things has 
motivated extensive research on self-powered flexible sensors. The conventional 
sensor must be powered by a battery device, while innovative self-powered 
sensors can provide power for the sensing device. Self-powered flexible sensors 
can have higher mobility, wider distribution, and even wireless operation, while 
solving the problem of the limited life of the battery so that it can be 
continuously operated and widely utilized. In recent years, the studies on 
piezoelectric nanogenerators (PENGs) and triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) 
have mainly concentrated on self-powered flexible sensors. Self-powered flexible 
sensors based on PENGs and TENGs have been reported as sensing devices in many 
application fields, such as human health monitoring, environmental monitoring, 
wearable devices, electronic skin, human-machine interfaces, robots, and 
intelligent transportation and cities. This review summarizes the development 
process of the sensor in terms of material design and structural optimization, 
as well as introduces its frontier applications in related fields. We also look 
forward to the development prospects and future of self-powered flexible 
sensors.

As Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming ubiquitous in many applications, 
serverless computing is also emerging as a building block for developing 
cloud-based AI services. Serverless computing has received much interest because 
of its simplicity, scalability, and resource efficiency. However, due to the 
trade-off with resource efficiency, serverless computing suffers from the cold 
start problem, that is, a latency between a request arrival and function 
execution. The cold start problem significantly influences the overall response 
time of workflow that consists of functions because the cold start may occur in 
every function within the workflow. Function fusion can be one of the solutions 
to mitigate the cold start latency of a workflow. If two functions are fused 
into a single function, the cold start of the second function is removed; 
however, if parallel functions are fused, the workflow response time can be 
increased because the parallel functions run sequentially even if the cold start 
latency is reduced. This study presents an approach to mitigate the cold start 
latency of a workflow using function fusion while considering a parallel run. 
First, we identify three latencies that affect response time, present a workflow 
response time model considering the latency, and efficiently find a fusion 
solution that can optimize the response time on the cold start. Our method shows 
a response time of 28-86% of the response time of the original workflow in five 
workflows.

Pose Estimation.

Technological advances enable the design of systems that interact more closely 
with humans in a multitude of previously unsuspected fields. Martial arts are 
not outside the application of these techniques. From the point of view of the 
modeling of human movement in relation to the learning of complex motor skills, 
martial arts are of interest because they are articulated around a system of 
movements that are predefined, or at least, bounded, and governed by the laws of 
Physics. Their execution must be learned after continuous practice over time. 
Literature suggests that artificial intelligence algorithms, such as those used 
for computer vision, can model the movements performed. Thus, they can be 
compared with a good execution as well as analyze their temporal evolution 
during learning. We are exploring the application of this approach to model 
psychomotor performance in Karate combats (called kumites), which are 
characterized by the explosiveness of their movements. In addition, modeling 
psychomotor performance in a kumite requires the modeling of the joint 
interaction of two participants, while most current research efforts in human 
movement computing focus on the modeling of movements performed individually. 
Thus, in this work, we explore how to apply a pose estimation algorithm to 
extract the features of some predefined movements of Ippon Kihon kumite (a 
one-step conventional assault) and compare classification metrics with four data 
mining algorithms, obtaining high values with them.

With the widespread application of machine learning methods, the continuous 
improvement of forecast accuracy has become an important task, which is 
especially crucial for landslide displacement predictions. This study aimed to 
propose a novel prediction model to improve accuracy in landslide prediction, 
based on the combination of multiple new algorithms. The proposed new method 
includes three parts: data preparation, multi-swarm intelligence (MSI) 
optimization, and displacement prediction. In the data preparation, the complete 
ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD) is adopted to separate the trend 
and periodic displacements from the observed cumulative landslide displacement. 
The frequency component and residual component of reconstructed inducing factors 
that related to landslide movements are also extracted by the CEEMD and t-test, 
and then picked out with edit distance on real sequence (EDR) as input variables 
for the support vector regression (SVR) model. MSI optimization algorithms are 
used to optimize the SVR model in the MSI optimization; thus, six predictions 
models can be obtained that can be used in the displacement prediction part. 
Finally, the trend and periodic displacements are predicted by six optimized SVR 
models, respectively. The trend displacement and periodic displacement with the 
highest prediction accuracy are added and regarded as the final prediction 
result. The case study of the Shiliushubao landslide shows that the prediction 
results match the observed data well with an improvement in the aspect of 
average relative error, which indicates that the proposed model can predict 
landslide displacements with high precision, even when the displacements are 
characterized by stepped curves that under the influence of multiple 
time-varying factors.

Human operators have the trend of increasing physical and mental workloads when 
performing teleoperation tasks in uncertain and dynamic environments. In 
addition, their performances are influenced by subjective factors, potentially 
leading to operational errors or task failure. Although agent-based methods 
offer a promising solution to the above problems, the human experience and 
intelligence are necessary for teleoperation scenarios. In this paper, a 
truncated quantile critics reinforcement learning-based integrated framework is 
proposed for human-agent teleoperation that encompasses training, assessment and 
agent-based arbitration. The proposed framework allows for an expert training 
agent, a bilateral training and cooperation process to realize the 
co-optimization of agent and human. It can provide efficient and quantifiable 
training feedback. Experiments have been conducted to train subjects with the 
developed algorithm. The performances of human-human and human-agent cooperation 
modes are also compared. The results have shown that subjects can complete the 
tasks of reaching and picking and placing with the assistance of an agent in a 
shorter operational time, with a higher success rate and less workload than 
human-human cooperation.

In a progressively interconnected world where the Internet of Things (IoT), 
ubiquitous computing, and artificial intelligence are leading to groundbreaking 
technology, cybersecurity remains an underdeveloped aspect. This is particularly 
alarming for brain-to-computer interfaces (BCIs), where hackers can threaten the 
user's physical and psychological safety. In fact, standard algorithms currently 
employed in BCI systems are inadequate to deal with cyberattacks. In this paper, 
we propose a solution to improve the cybersecurity of BCI systems. As a case 
study, we focus on P300-based BCI systems using support vector machine (SVM) 
algorithms and EEG data. First, we verified that SVM algorithms are incapable of 
identifying hacking by simulating a set of cyberattacks using fake P300 signals 
and noise-based attacks. This was achieved by comparing the performance of 
several models when validated using real and hacked P300 datasets. Then, we 
implemented our solution to improve the cybersecurity of the system. The 
proposed solution is based on an EEG channel mixing approach to identify 
anomalies in the transmission channel due to hacking. Our study demonstrates 
that the proposed architecture can successfully identify 99.996% of simulated 
cyberattacks, implementing a dedicated counteraction that preserves most of BCI 
functions.

COVID-19 is a transferable disease that is also a leading cause of death for a 
large number of people worldwide. This disease, caused by SARS-CoV-2, spreads 
very rapidly and quickly affects the respiratory system of the human being. 
Therefore, it is necessary to diagnosis this disease at the early stage for 
proper treatment, recovery, and controlling the spread. The automatic diagnosis 
system is significantly necessary for COVID-19 detection. To diagnose COVID-19 
from chest X-ray images, employing artificial intelligence techniques based 
methods are more effective and could correctly diagnosis it. The existing 
diagnosis methods of COVID-19 have the problem of lack of accuracy to diagnosis. 
To handle this problem we have proposed an efficient and accurate diagnosis 
model for COVID-19. In the proposed method, a two-dimensional Convolutional 
Neural Network (2DCNN) is designed for COVID-19 recognition employing chest 
X-ray images. Transfer learning (TL) pre-trained ResNet-50 model weight is 
transferred to the 2DCNN model to enhanced the training process of the 2DCNN 
model and fine-tuning with chest X-ray images data for final 
multi-classification to diagnose COVID-19. In addition, the data augmentation 
technique transformation (rotation) is used to increase the data set size for 
effective training of the R2DCNNMC model. The experimental results demonstrated 
that the proposed (R2DCNNMC) model obtained high accuracy and obtained 98.12% 
classification accuracy on CRD data set, and 99.45% classification accuracy on 
CXI data set as compared to baseline methods. This approach has a high 
performance and could be used for COVID-19 diagnosis in E-Healthcare systems.

Micro-Behavioral Accidental Click Detection System for Preventing Slip-Based 
Human Error.

University of Tabuk, Tabuk 71491, Saudi Arabia.

Accidentally clicking on a link is a type of human error known as a slip in 
which a user unintentionally performs an unintended task. The risk magnitude is 
the probability of occurrences of such error with a possible substantial effect 
to which even experienced individuals are susceptible. Phishing attacks take 
advantage of slip-based human error by attacking psychological aspects of the 
users that lead to unintentionally clicking on phishing links. Such actions may 
lead to installing tracking software, downloading malware or viruses, or 
stealing private, sensitive information, to list a few. Therefore, a system is 
needed that detects whether a click on a link is intentional or unintentional 
and, if unintentional, can then prevent it. This paper proposes a 
micro-behavioral accidental click detection system (ACDS) to prevent slip-based 
human error. A within-subject-based experiment was conducted with 20 
participants to test the potential of the proposed system. The results reveal 
the statistical significance between the two cases of intentional vs. 
unintentional clicks using a smartphone. Random tree, random forest, and support 
vector machine classifiers were used, exhibiting 82.6%, 87.2%, and 91.6% 
accuracy in detecting unintentional clicks, respectively.

Comprehensive Analysis of Machine Learning.

The adoption of low-crested and submerged structures (LCS) reduces the wave 
behind a structure, depending on the changes in the freeboard, and induces 
stable waves in the offshore. We aimed to estimate the wave transmission 
coefficient behind LCS structures to determine the feasible characteristics of 
wave mitigation. In addition, various empirical formulas based on regression 
analysis were proposed to quantitatively predict wave attenuation 
characteristics for field applications. However, inherent variability of wave 
attenuation causes the limitation of linear statistical approaches, such as 
linear regression analysis. Herein, to develop an optimization model for the 
hydrodynamic behavior of the LCS, we performed a comprehensive analysis of 10 
types of machine learning models, which were compared and reviewed on the 
prediction accuracy with existing empirical formulas. We found that, among the 
10 models, the gradient boosting model showed the highest prediction accuracy 
with MSE of 1.0 × 10-3, an index of agreement of 0.996, a scatter index of 
0.065, and a correlation coefficient of 0.983, which indicates a performance 
improvement over the existing empirical formulas. In addition, based on a 
variable importance analysis using explainable artificial intelligence, we 
determined the significant importance of the input variable for the relative 
freeboard (RC/H0) and the relative freeboard to water depth ratio (RC/h), which 
confirms that the relative freeboard was the most dominant factor for 
influencing wave attenuation in the hydraulic behavior around the LCS. Thus, we 
concluded that the performance prediction method using a machine learning model

The recent development in the area of IoT technologies is likely to be 
implemented extensively in the next decade. There is a great increase in the 
crime rate, and the handling officers are responsible for dealing with a broad 
range of cyber and Internet issues during investigation. IoT technologies are 
helpful in the identification of suspects, and few technologies are available 
that use IoT and deep learning together for face sketch synthesis. Convolutional 
neural networks (CNNs) and other constructs of deep learning have become major 
tools in recent approaches. A new-found architecture of the neural network is 
anticipated in this work. It is called Spiral-Net, which is a modified version 
of U-Net fto perform face sketch synthesis (the phase is known as the compiler 
network C here). Spiral-Net performs in combination with a pre-trained Vgg-19 
network called the feature extractor F. It first identifies the top n matches 
from viewed sketches to a given photo. F is again used to formulate a feature 
map based on the cosine distance of a candidate sketch formed by C from the top 
n matches. A customized CNN configuration (called the discriminator D) then 
computes loss functions based on differences between the candidate sketch and 
the feature. Values of these loss functions alternately update C and F. The 
ensemble of these nets is trained and tested on selected datasets, including 
CUFS, CUFSF, and a part of the IIT photo-sketch dataset. Results of this 
modified U-Net are acquired by the legacy NLDA (1998) scheme of face recognition 
and its newer version, OpenBR (2013), which demonstrate an improvement of 5% 
compared with the current state of the art in its relevant domain.

Malnutrition is common, especially among older, hospitalised patients, and is 
associated with higher mortality, longer hospitalisation stays, infections, and 
loss of muscle mass. It is therefore of utmost importance to employ a proper 
method for dietary assessment that can be used for the identification and 
management of malnourished hospitalised patients. In this study, we propose an 
automated Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based system that receives input images 
of the meals before and after their consumption and is able to estimate the 
patient's energy, carbohydrate, protein, fat, and fatty acids intake. The system 
jointly segments the images into the different food components and plate types, 
estimates the volume of each component before and after consumption, and 
calculates the energy and macronutrient intake for every meal, based on the 
kitchen's menu database. Data acquired from an acute geriatric hospital as well 
as from our previous study were used for the fine-tuning and evaluation of the 
system. The results from both our system and the hospital's standard procedure 
were compared to the estimations of experts. Agreement was better with the 
system, suggesting that it has the potential to replace standard clinical 
procedures with a positive impact on time spent directly with the patients.

Anxiety disorders are the most common group of mental disorders. There is 
mounting evidence demonstrating the importance of nutrition in the development 
and progression of mental disorders such as depression; however, less is known 
about the role of nutrition in anxiety disorders. This scoping review sought to 
systematically map the existing literature on anxiety disorders and nutrition in 
order to identify associations between dietary factors and anxiety symptoms or 
disorder prevalence as well as identify gaps and opportunities for further 
research. The review followed established methodological approaches for scoping 
reviews. Due to the large volume of results, an online program (Abstrackr) with 
artificial intelligence features was used. Studies reporting an association 
between a dietary constituent and anxiety symptoms or disorders were counted and 
presented in figures. A total of 55,914 unique results were identified. After a 
full-text review, 1541 articles met criteria for inclusion. Analysis revealed an 
association between less anxiety and more fruits and vegetables, omega-3 fatty 
acids, "healthy" dietary patterns, caloric restriction, breakfast consumption, 
ketogenic diet, broad-spectrum micronutrient supplementation, zinc, magnesium 
and selenium, probiotics, and a range of phytochemicals. Analysis revealed an 
association between higher levels of anxiety and high-fat diet, inadequate 
tryptophan and dietary protein, high intake of sugar and refined carbohydrates, 
and "unhealthy" dietary patterns. Results are limited by a large percentage of 
animal and observational studies. Only 10% of intervention studies involved 
participants with anxiety disorders, limiting the applicability of the findings. 
High quality intervention studies involving participants with anxiety disorders 
are warranted.

Orodispersible films (ODFs) are an attractive delivery system for a myriad of 
clinical applications and possess both large economical and clinical rewards. 
However, the manufacturing of ODFs does not adhere to contemporary paradigms of 
personalised, on-demand medicine, nor sustainable manufacturing. To address 
these shortcomings, both three-dimensional (3D) printing and machine learning 
(ML) were employed to provide on-demand manufacturing and quality control checks 
of ODFs. Direct ink writing (DIW) was able to fabricate complex ODF shapes, with 
thicknesses of less than 100 µm. ML algorithms were explored to classify the 
ODFs according to their active ingredient, by using their near-infrared (NIR) 
spectrums. A supervised model of linear discriminant analysis was found to 
provide 100% accuracy in classifying ODFs. A subsequent partial least square 
algorithm was applied to verify the dose, where a coefficient of determination 
of 0.96, 0.99 and 0.98 was obtained for ODFs of paracetamol, caffeine, and 
theophylline, respectively. Therefore, it was concluded that the combination of 
3D printing, NIR and ML can result in a rapid production and verification of 
ODFs. Additionally, a machine vision tool was used to automate the in vitro 
testing. These collective digital technologies demonstrate the potential to 
automate the ODF workflow.

Given the globally abundant availability of waste plastics and the negative 
environmental impacts of textile dyeing sludge (TDS), their co-combustion can 
effectively enhance the circular economies, energy recovery, and environmental 
pollution control. The (co-)combustion performances, gas emissions, and ashes of 
TDS and two plastics of polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) were quantified 
and characterized. The increased blend ratio of PP and PE improved the ignition, 
burnout, and comprehensive combustion indices. The two plastics interacted with 
TDS significantly in the range of 200-600 ℃. TDS pre-ignited the combustion of 
the plastics which in turn promoted the combustion of TDS. The co-combustions 
released more CO2 but less CH4, C-H, and CO as CO2 was less persistent than the 
others in the atmosphere. The Ca-based minerals in the plastics enhanced 
S-fixation and reduced SO2 emission. The activation energy of the co-combustion 
fell from 126.78 to 111.85 kJ/mol and 133.71-79.91 kJ/mol when the PE and PP 
additions rose from 10% to 50%, respectively. The co-combustion reaction 
mechanism was best described by the model of f(α) = (1-α)n. The reaction order 
was reduced with the additions of the plastics. The co-combustion operation 
interactions were optimized via an artificial neural network so as to jointly 
meet the multiple objectives of maximum energy production and minimum emissions.

PURPOSE: High-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy (BT) is an effective cancer 
treatment method in which the radiation source is placed within the body. 
Treatment planning is a critical component for a successful outcome. Almost all 
currently proposed treatment planning methods are built on stochastic heuristic 
algorithms, which limits the generation of higher quality plans. This study 
proposed a novel treatment planning method to adjust dwell times in a human-like 
fashion to improve the quality of the plan.
METHODS: We built an intelligent treatment planner network (ITPN) based on deep 
reinforcement learning (DRL). The network architecture of ITPN is Dueling 
Double-Deep Q Network. The state is the dwell time of each dwell position and 
the action is which dwell time to adjust and how to adjust it. A hybrid 
equivalent uniform dose objective function was established and assigned 
corresponding rewards according to its changes. Experience replay was performed 
with the epsilon greedy algorithm and SumTree data structure.
RESULTS: In the evaluation of ITPN using 20 patient cases, D90, D100 and V100 
showed no significant difference compared with inverse planning simulated 
annealing (IPSA) optimization. However, D2cc of bladder, rectum and sigmoid, 
V150 and V200 were significant reduced, and homogeneity index and conformity 
index were significantly increased.
CONCLUSION: The proposed ITPN was able to generate higher quality plans based on 
the learned dwell time adjustment policy than IPSA. This is the first artificial 
intelligence system that can directly determine the dwell times of HDR BT, which 
demonstrated the potential feasibility of solving optimization problems via DRL.

Criminal offenders missing from police files limit the capacity to reconstruct 
criminal networks for criminological research and operational purposes. Recent 
studies show that forensic DNA databanks offer potential to address this 
problem, through large-scale analysis of DNA matches, many of which involve 
unidentified offenders. Applying social network analysis (SNA) to 18 years of 
DNA match data from Québec, Canada, we found that 1400 unknowns do not occupy 
more marginal positions in the network than 13,000 known offenders, and explain 
up to 18% of SNA values (e.g., betweenness centrality) for the latter while 
supporting 46% of their clustering values. Our results contrast with previous 
studies, showing moreover that unknown individuals who are positioned centrally 
in a network may have a larger impact than previously expected on investigation 
policing with implications for forensic intelligence.

Artificial intelligence (AI)-based protein structure databases are expected to 
have an impact on drug discovery. Here, we show how AlphaFold could support rare 
diseases research programs. We focus on Alsin, a protein responsible for rare 
motor neuron diseases, such as infantile-onset ascending hereditary spastic 
paralysis (IAHSP) and juvenile primary lateral sclerosis (JPLS), and involved in 
some cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). First, we compared the 
AlphaFoldDB human Alsin model with homology models of Alsin domains. We then 
evaluated the flexibility profile of Alsin and of experimentally characterized 
mutants present in patients with IAHSP. Next, we compared preliminary models of 
dimeric/tetrameric Alsin responsible for its physiological action with 
hypothetical models reported in the literature. Finally, we suggest the best 
animal model for drug candidates testing. Overall, we computationally show that 
drug discovery efforts toward Alsin-involving diseases should be pursued.

The Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic has reshaped clinical chronic 
disease management. Patients reduced the number of physical clinic visits for 
regular follow-up care because of the pandemic. However, in developing 
countries, the scattered healthcare system hindered accessibility to clinical 
consultation, and poorly controlled chronic diseases resulted in numerous 
complications. Furthermore, the longer patients suffered from the chronic 
disease being treated, the more physical and psychological stress they 
experienced. "Diabetes Burnout," as an example, is a term to describe the 
phenomenon of psychological reluctance in long-term glycemic control. A 
comprehensive, patient-centered, and automatic drug administration and delivery 
model may reduce patient stress and increase compliance. Potential 
next-generation medication platforms, consisting of internal regulation and 
external interaction, may conduct autonomous dose adjustment and continuous 
selfmonitoring with the assistance of artificial intelligence, telemedicine, and 
wireless technologies. Internal regulation forms a closed-loop system in which 
drug administration is optimized in an implanted drug-releasing device according 
to a patient's physiopathological response. The other feature, external 
interaction, creates an ecosystem among patients, healthcare providers, and 
pharmaceutical researchers to monitor and adjust post-market therapeutic 
efficacy and safety. These platforms may provide a solution for self-medication 
and self-care for a wide variety of patients but may be life-changing for 
patients who live in developing countries where the healthcare system is 
scattered, as they could effectively remove healthcare barriers. As the 
technology matures, these self-administrated platforms may become more available 
and increasingly affordable, offering considerable impact to health and wellness 
efforts worldwide.

INTRODUCTION: For many years, treatment options for patients with Eisenmenger 
physiology had been restricted to conservative measures to alleviate 
multi-system complications. The use of pulmonary arterial hypertension 
(PAH)-targeted therapies in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome (ES) changed the 
course of the disease, since they substantially improved clinical outcomes and 
increased survival.
AREAS COVERED: In this review, we primarily focus on the use of PAH 
pharmacotherapies in ES. A literature search was carried out in PubMed, Scopus 
and Cochrane Database up to May 2021. We thoroughly discuss current evidence 
about mechanisms of action, safety, and efficacy of these agents and present 
challenges and gaps in literature regarding the recommended treatment approach.
EXPERT OPINION: Unlike other forms of PAH, we usually treat patients with ES 
more conservatively as we lack evidence that aggressive management is safe and 
effective in this complex population. Several issues on the time of initiation 
of PAH-targeted therapies, choice between monotherapy vs. upfront combination 
therapy, and time of escalation still remain challenging and require further 
investigation. Therapeutic management should be guided by patients' individual 
evaluation based on available prognostic markers. More well-designed trials are 
warranted to assess the benefits of new PAH-targeted agents and combination 
therapies.

Inspired by the formation of random sparkling microcrystallines in naturally 
precious opals, we develop a new strategy to produce a class of unclonable 
photonic crystal hydrogels (UPCHs) induced by the electrostatic interaction 
effect, which further achieve unclonable encoding/decoding and random 
high-encrypted patterns along with an ultrahigh and controllable encoding 
capacity up to ca. 2 × 10166055. Owing to the randomness of colloidal crystals 
in the self-assembly process, UPCHs with randomly distributed sparkling spots 
are endowed with unpredictable/unrepeatable characteristics. This, coupled with 
the water response of UPCHs with angle dependence and robustness, can upgrade 
the encryption level and address some limitations of easy fading, limited 
durability, and high cost in practical uses of existing unclonable materials. 
Interestingly, UPCHs can be readily patterned to exhibit reliable and rapid 
authentication by utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) deep learning, which 
can find broad applications in developing unbreakable and portable information 
storage/steganography systems not limited to anticounterfeiting.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) performs human intelligence-dependant tasks using 
tools such as Machine Learning, and its subtype Deep Learning. AI has 
incorporated itself in the field of cardiovascular medicine, and increasingly 
employed to revolutionize diagnosis, treatment, risk prediction, clinical care, 
and drug discovery. Heart failure has a high prevalence, and mortality rate 
following hospitalization being 10.4% at 30-days, 22% at 1-year, and 42.3% at 
5-years. Early detection of heart failure is of vital importance in shaping the 
medical, and surgical interventions specific to HF patients. This has been 
accomplished with the advent of Neural Network (NN) model, the accuracy of which 
has proven to be 85%. AI can be of tremendous help in analyzing raw image data 
from cardiac imaging techniques (such as echocardiography, computed tomography, 
cardiac MRI amongst others) and electrocardiogram recordings through 
incorporation of an algorithm. The use of decision trees by Rough Sets (RS), and 
logistic regression (LR) methods utilized to construct decision-making model to 
diagnose congestive heart failure, and role of AI in early detection of future 
mortality and destabilization episodes has played a vital role in optimizing 
cardiovascular disease outcomes. The review highlights the major achievements of 
AI in recent years that has radically changed nearly all areas of HF prevention, 
diagnosis, and management.

INTRODUCTION: Computed tomography (CT) is an auxiliary modality in the diagnosis 
of the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) disease and can guide physicians in the 
presence of lung involvement. In this study, we aimed to investigate the 
contribution of deep learning to diagnosis in patients with typical COVID-19 
pneumonia findings on CT.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study retrospectively evaluated 690 lesions obtained 
from 35 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia based on typical findings on 
non-contrast high-resolution CT (HRCT) in our hospital. The diagnoses of the 
patients were also confirmed by other necessary tests. HRCT images were assessed 
in the parenchymal window. In the images obtained, COVID-19 lesions were 
detected. For the deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm, the 
Confusion matrix was used based on a Tensorflow Framework in Python.
RESULT: A total of 596 labeled lesions obtained from 224 sections of the images 
were used for the training of the algorithm, 89 labeled lesions from 27 sections 
were used in validation, and 67 labeled lesions from 25 images in testing. 
Fifty-six of the 67 lesions used in the testing stage were accurately detected 
by the algorithm while the remaining 11 were not recognized. There was no false 
positive. The Recall, Precision and F1 score values in the test group were 
83.58, 1, and 91.06, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: We successfully detected the COVID-19 pneumonia lesions on CT 
images using the algorithms created with artificial intelligence. The 
integration of deep learning into the diagnostic stage in medicine is an 
important step for the diagnosis of diseases that can cause lung involvement in 
possible future pandemics.

To meet critical requirements on flexible electronic devices, 
multifunctionalized flexible sensors with excellent electromechanical 
performance and temperature perception are required. Herein, lignin-reinforced 
thermoresponsive poly(ionic liquid) hydrogel is prepared through an 
ultrasound-assisted synthesized method. Benefitting from the electrostatic 
interaction between lignin and ionic liquid, the hydrogel displays high 
stretchability (over 1425%), excellent toughness (over 132 kPa), and impressive 
stress loading-unloading cyclic stability. The hydrogel strain sensor presents 
excellent electromechanical performance with a high gauge factor (1.37) and 
rapid response rate (198 ms), which lays the foundation for human body movement 
detection and smart input. Moreover, owing to the thermal-sensitive feature of 
poly(ionic liquid), the as-prepared hydrogel displays remarkable thermal 
response sensitivity (0.217°C-1) in body temperature range and low limit of 
detection, which can be applied as a body shell temperature indicator. 
Particularly, the hydrogel can detect dual stimuli of strain and temperature and 
identify each signal individually, showing the specific application in 
human-machine interaction and artificial intelligence. By integrating the 
hydrogel strain sensor into a wireless sensation system, remote motion capture 
and gesture identification is realized in real-time.

Australia.

In the last two decades, artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed the way in 
which we consume and analyse sports. The role of AI in improving decision-making 
and forecasting in sports, amongst many other advantages, is rapidly expanding 
and gaining more attention in both the academic sector and the industry. 
Nonetheless, for many sports audiences, professionals and policy makers, who are 
not particularly au courant or experts in AI, the connexion between artificial 
intelligence and sports remains fuzzy. Likewise, for many, the motivations for 
adopting a machine learning (ML) paradigm in sports analytics are still either 
faint or unclear. In this perspective paper, we present a high-level, 
non-technical, overview of the machine learning paradigm that motivates its 
potential for enhancing sports (performance and business) analytics. We provide 
a summary of some relevant research literature on the areas in which artificial 
intelligence and machine learning have been applied to the sports industry and 
in sport research. Finally, we present some hypothetical scenarios of how AI and 
ML could shape the future of sports.

Heart disease is a leading cause of death among cats and dogs. Vertebral heart 
scale (VHS) is one tool to quantify radiographic cardiac enlargement and to 
predict the occurrence of congestive heart failure. The aim of this study was to 
evaluate the performance of artificial intelligence (AI) performing VHS 
measurements when compared with two board-certified specialists. Ground truth 
consisted of the average of constituent VHS measurements performed by 
board-certified specialists. Thirty canine and 30 feline thoracic lateral 
radiographs were evaluated by each operator, using two different methods for 
determination of the cardiac short axis on dogs' radiographs: the original 
approach published by Buchanan and the modified approach proposed by the EPIC 
trial authors, and only Buchanan's method for cats' radiographs. Overall, the 
VHS calculated by the AI, radiologist, and cardiologist had a high degree of 
agreement in both canine and feline patients (intraclass correlation coefficient 
(ICC) = 0.998). In canine patients, when comparing methods used to calculate VHS 
by specialists, there was also a high degree of agreement (ICC = 0.999). When 
evaluating specifically the results of the AI VHS vs. the two specialists' 
readings, the agreement was excellent for both canine (ICC = 0.998) and feline 
radiographs (ICC = 0.998). Performance of AI trained to locate VHS reference 
points agreed with manual calculation by specialists in both cats and dogs. Such 
a computer-aided technique might be an important asset for veterinarians in 
general practice to limit interobserver variability and obtain more comparable 
VHS reading over time.

Severe mitral regurgitation (MR) is a cardiac disease that can lead to fatal 
consequences. MitraClip (MC) intervention is a percutaneous procedure whereby 
the mitral valve (MV) leaflets are connected along the edge using MCs. The 
outcomes of the MC intervention are not known in advance, i.e., the outcomes are 
quite variable. Artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to guide the 
cardiologist in selecting optimal MC scenarios. In this study, we describe an 
atlas of shapes as well as different scenarios for MC implantation for such an 
AI analysis. We generated the MV geometrical data from three different sources. 
First, the patients' 3-dimensional echo images were used. The pixel data from 
six key points were obtained from three views of the echo images. Using PyGem, 
an open-source morphing library in Python, these coordinates were used to create 
the geometry by morphing a template geometry. Second, the dimensions of the MV, 
from the literature were used to create data. Third, we used machine learning 
methods, principal component analysis, and generative adversarial networks to 
generate more shapes. We used the finite element (FE) software ABAQUS to 
simulate smoothed particle hydrodynamics in different scenarios for MC 
intervention. The MR and stresses in the leaflets were post-processed. Our 
physics-based FE models simulated the outcomes of MC intervention for different 
scenarios. The MR and stresses in the leaflets were computed by the FE models 
for a single clip at different locations as well as two and three clips. Results 
from FE simulations showed that the location and number of MCs affect subsequent 
residual MR, and that leaflet stresses do not follow a simple pattern. 
Furthermore, FE models need several hours to provide the results, and they are 
not applicable for clinical usage where the predicted outcomes of MC therapy are 
needed in real-time. In this study, we generated the required dataset for the AI 
models which can provide the results in a matter of seconds.

Driven by recent innovations and technological progress, the increasing quality 
and amount of biomedical data coupled with the advances in computing power 
allowed for much progress in artificial intelligence (AI) approaches for health 
and biomedical research. In interventional cardiology, the hope is for AI to 
provide automated analysis and deeper interpretation of data from 
electrocardiography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and 
electronic health records, among others. Furthermore, high-performance 
predictive models supporting decision-making hold the potential to improve 
safety, diagnostic and prognostic prediction in patients undergoing 
interventional cardiology procedures. These applications include 
robotic-assisted percutaneous coronary intervention procedures and automatic 
assessment of coronary stenosis during diagnostic coronary angiograms. Machine 
learning (ML) has been used in these innovations that have improved the field of 
interventional cardiology, and more recently, deep Learning (DL) has emerged as 
one of the most successful branches of ML in many applications. It remains to be 
seen if DL approaches will have a major impact on current and future practice. 
DL-based predictive systems also have several limitations, including lack of 
interpretability and lack of generalizability due to cohort heterogeneity and 
low sample sizes. There are also challenges for the clinical implementation of 
these systems, such as ethical limits and data privacy. This review is intended 
to bring the attention of health practitioners and interventional cardiologists 
to the broad and helpful applications of ML and DL algorithms to date in the 
field. Their implementation challenges in daily practice and future applications 
in the field of interventional cardiology are also discussed.

Introduction: Iodine deficiency during pregnancy can cause hypothyroidism and 
goiter; in schoolchildren, it can cause reduced intelligence quotient. In 
excess, iodine can cause thyroiditis, goiter, and Hashimoto's hypothyroidism. 
Currently, schoolchildren and pregnant women are classified as risk groups for 
excessive iodine intake and iodine deficiency, respectively. Thus, determining 
iodine from all sources of consumption is important for intervention planning. 
Objective: To construct a theoretical model for the iodine intake of 
schoolchildren and pregnant women of a city in the Zona da Mata Mineira region, 
considering a healthy diet, salt consumption and water intake. Methodology: The 
dietary iodine intake of pregnant women was analyzed based on a dietary iodine 
table compiled from an international database. A dietary plan was prepared 
following the Brazilian Food Guide. Iodine concentration of different salt 
brands sold in local establishments was checked, and drinking water samples from 
healthcare facilities were analyzed. A descriptive and exploratory statistical 
analysis was performed and the results were presented in absolute and relative 
frequencies, and measures of central tendency and dispersion. Results: According 
to the proposed diet, pregnant women and schoolchildren would have a daily 
intake of 71.6 μg and 71 μg, respectively. Thirteen salt brands were evaluated, 
69.2% complied with the legislation and the mean iodine content was 29.88 mg. 
The mean concentration of iodine in water was 25 μg iodine/liter and 14 μg 
iodine/liter, respectively, in summer and autumn. Considering the intake of 
food, salt, and drinking water according to the proposed dietary plan, the daily 
intake for pregnant women would be 279.5 and 253.5 μg for schoolchildren. 
Conclusion: The daily iodine intake of schoolchildren and pregnant women 
according to this theoretical model was excessive, considering a healthy dietary 
pattern. This theoretical model can guide actions and public policies aimed at 
targeting all forms of iodine intake.

The perception of feeling lonely is an influential factor in determining quality 
of life among aging adults. As the US Census Bureau projects that the number of 
Americans ages 65 and older will double by 2060, reducing loneliness is 
imperative. Personal voice assistants (PVAs) such as Amazon's Echo offer the 
ease-of-use of voice control with a friendly, helpful artificial intelligence. 
This study aimed to understand the influence of a PVA on loneliness reduction 
among adults of advanced ages, i.e., 75+, and explore anthropomorphism as a 
potential underlying mechanism. Participants (N = 16) ages 75 or older used an 
Amazon Echo PVA for 8 weeks in an independent living facility in the Midwest. 
Surveys were used to collect information about perceived loneliness, and PVA 
interaction data was recorded and analyzed. Participants consistently exceeded 
the required daily interactions. As hypothesized, after the first 4 weeks of the 
intervention, aging adults reported significantly lower loneliness (baseline 
mean = 2.22, SD = 0.42; week 4 mean = 1.99, SD = 0.45, Z = -2.45, and p = 0.01). 
Four dominant anthropomorphic themes emerged after thematic analysis of the 
entire 8 weeks' PVA interaction data (Cohen's Kappa = 0.92): (1) greetings 
(user-initiated, friendly phrases); (2) comments/questions (user-initiated, 
second-person pronoun), (3) polite interactions (user-initiated, direct-name 
friendly requests), (4) reaction (user response to Alexa). Relational greetings 
predicted loneliness reductions in the first 4 weeks and baseline loneliness 
predicted relational greetings with the PVA during the entire 8 weeks, 
suggesting that anthropomorphization of PVAs may play a role in mitigating 
loneliness in aging adults.

The race to meet the challenges of the global pandemic has served as a reminder 
that the existing drug discovery process is expensive, inefficient and slow. 
There is a major bottleneck screening the vast number of potential small 
molecules to shortlist lead compounds for antiviral drug development. New 
opportunities to accelerate drug discovery lie at the interface between machine 
learning methods, in this case, developed for linear accelerators, and 
physics-based methods. The two in silico methods, each have their own advantages 
and limitations which, interestingly, complement each other. Here, we present an 
innovative infrastructural development that combines both approaches to 
accelerate drug discovery. The scale of the potential resulting workflow is such 
that it is dependent on supercomputing to achieve extremely high throughput. We 
have demonstrated the viability of this workflow for the study of inhibitors for 
four COVID-19 target proteins and our ability to perform the required 
large-scale calculations to identify lead antiviral compounds through

This paper aims to explore the application value of SonoVue contrast-enhanced 
ultrasonography based on deep unsupervised learning (DNS) in the diagnosis of 
nipple discharge. In this paper, a new model (ODNS) is proposed based on the 
unsupervised learning model and stack self-coding network. The ultrasonic images 
of 1,725 patients with breast lesions in the shared database are used as the 
test data of the model. The differences in accuracy (Acc), recall (RE), 
sensitivity (Sen), and running time between the two models before and after 
optimization and other algorithms are compared. A total of 48 female patients 
with nipple discharge are enrolled. The differences in SE, specificity (SP), 
positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of 
conventional ultrasound and contrast-enhanced ultrasonography are analyzed based 
on pathological examination results. The results showed that when the number of 
network layers is 5, the classification accuracies of DNS and ODNS model data 
reached the highest values, which were 91.45% and 98.64%, respectively.

This study was aimed at exploring the application value of transcranial Doppler 
(TCD) based on artificial intelligence algorithm in monitoring the 
neuroendocrine changes in patients with severe head injury in the acute phase; 
80 patients with severe brain injury were included in this study as the study 
subjects, and they were randomly divided into the control group (conventional 
TCD) and the experimental group (algorithm-optimized TCD), 40 patients in each 
group. An artificial intelligence neighborhood segmentation algorithm for TCD 
images was designed to comprehensively evaluate the application value of this 
algorithm by measuring the TCD image area segmentation error and running time of 
this algorithm. In addition, the Glasgow coma scale (GCS) and each 
neuroendocrine hormone level were used to assess the neuroendocrine status of 
the patients. The results showed that the running time of the artificial 
intelligence neighborhood segmentation algorithm for TCD was 3.14 ± 1.02 s, 
which was significantly shorter than 32.23 ± 9.56 s of traditional convolutional 
neural network (CNN) algorithms (P < 0.05). The false rejection rate (FRR) of 
TCD image area segmentation of this algorithm was significantly reduced, and the 
false acceptance rate (FAR) and true acceptance rate (TAR) were significantly 
increased (P < 0.05). The consistent rate of the GCS score and Doppler 
ultrasound imaging diagnosis results in the experimental group was 93.8%, which 
was significantly higher than the 80.3% in the control group (P < 0.05). The 
consistency rate of Doppler ultrasound imaging diagnosis results of patients in 
the experimental group with abnormal levels of follicle stimulating hormone 
(FSH), prolactin (PRL), growth hormone (GH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), 
and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was significantly higher than that of the 
control group (P < 0.05). In summary, the artificial intelligence neighborhood 
segmentation algorithm can significantly shorten the processing time of the TCD 
image and reduce the segmentation error of the image area, which significantly 
improves the monitoring level of TCD for patients with severe craniocerebral 
injury and has good clinical application value.

Developing artificial intelligence (AI) agents is challenging for efficient 
exploration in visually rich and complex environments. In this study, we 
formulate the exploration question as a reinforcement learning problem and rely 
on intrinsic motivation to guide exploration behavior. Such intrinsic motivation 
is driven by curiosity and is calculated based on episode memory. To distribute 
the intrinsic motivation, we use a count-based method and temporal distance to 
generate it synchronously. We tested our approach in 3D maze-like environments 
and validated its performance in exploration tasks through extensive 
experiments. The experimental results show that our agent can learn exploration 
ability from raw sensory input and accomplish autonomous exploration across 
different mazes. In addition, the learned policy is not biased by stochastic 
objects. We also analyze the effects of different training methods and driving 
forces on exploration policy.

In order to successfully apply the Internet of Things and cloud computing to the 
administrative management of spatial structures and realize the systematization, 
digitization, and intelligence of administrative management, this article draws 
on research experience in related fields and considers the data characteristics 
and computing tasks of administrative management. The whole cycle of 
transmission, storage, postprocessing, and visualization is the main line of 
research, and a cloud computing-based spatial structure administrative 
management IoT system is constructed. First, by summarizing the application 
status of the Internet of Things, the general Internet of Things system is 
summarized into three levels, and combined with the specific work in the spatial 
structure administrative management, the overall framework of the spatial 
structure administrative management of the Internet of Things system is 
proposed, and the functional sublayers are carried out. Secondly, in response to 
the above problems, through the traditional image recognition system research 
and practical application investigation, in order to meet the user's 
requirements for the computing efficiency and recognition accuracy of the image 
recognition system, an image recognition system in the cloud computing 
environment is proposed. It proposes a fuzzy evaluation algorithm of health 
grade hierarchy analysis optimized for the index system and scoring system and a 
calculation method that uses time series to identify regular outliers. The 
optical image pixel-level fusion method and the infrared and visible image 
fusion method based on complementary information are proposed, and the image 
fusion software is developed. Finally, in order to enable the application layer 
to use cluster resources to efficiently and intelligently process massive 
monitoring data containing redundancy, heterogeneity, anomalies, and many other 
defects, according to the calculation process of each specific task of data 
preprocessing and postprocessing in the application layer, demonstrations are 
made one by one. After analysis, it is concluded that vertical storage of data 
blocks according to different sensor channels is the optimal strategy.

The rise of FinTech has been meteoric in China. Investing in mutual funds 
through robo-advisor has become a new innovation in the wealth management 
industry. In recent years, machine learning, especially deep learning, has been 
widely used in the financial industry to solve financial problems. This paper 
aims to improve the accuracy and timeliness of fund classification through the 
use of machine learning algorithms, that is, Gaussian hybrid clustering 
algorithm. At the same time, a deep learning-based prediction model is 
implemented to predict the price movement of fund classes based on the 
classification results. Fund classification carried out using 3,625 Chinese 
mutual funds shows both accurate and efficient results. The cluster-based 
spatiotemporal ensemble deep learning module shows better prediction accuracy 
than baseline models with only access to limited data samples. The main 
contribution of this paper is to provide a new approach to fund classification 
and price movement prediction to support the decision-making of the next 
generation robo-advisor assisted by artificial intelligence.

Generation Z is a data-driven generation. Everyone has the entirety of 
humanity's knowledge in their hands. The technological possibilities are 
endless. However, we use and misuse this blessing to face swap using deepfake. 
Deepfake is an emerging subdomain of artificial intelligence technology in which 
one person's face is overlaid over another person's face, which is very 
prominent across social media. Machine learning is the main element of 
deepfakes, and it has allowed deepfake images and videos to be generated 
considerably faster and at a lower cost. Despite the negative connotations 
associated with the phrase "deepfakes," the technology is being more widely 
employed commercially and individually. Although it is relatively new, the 
latest technological advances make it more and more challenging to detect 
deepfakes and synthesized images from real ones. An increasing sense of unease 
has developed around the emergence of deepfake technologies. Our main objective 
is to detect deepfake images from real ones accurately. In this research, we 
implemented several methods to detect deepfake images and make a comparative 
analysis. Our model was trained by datasets from Kaggle, which had 70,000 images 
from the Flickr dataset and 70,000 images produced by styleGAN. For this 
comparative study of the use of convolutional neural networks (CNN) to identify 
genuine and deepfake pictures, we trained eight different CNN models. Three of 
these models were trained using the DenseNet architecture (DenseNet121, 
DenseNet169, and DenseNet201); two were trained using the VGGNet architecture 
(VGG16, VGG19); one was with the ResNet50 architecture, one with the VGGFace, 
and one with a bespoke CNN architecture. We have also implemented a custom model 
that incorporates methods like dropout and padding that aid in determining 
whether or not the other models reflect their objectives. The results were 
categorized by five evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, 
and area under the ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve. Amongst all 
the models, VGGFace performed the best, with 99% accuracy. Besides, we obtained 
97% from the ResNet50, 96% from the DenseNet201, 95% from the DenseNet169, 94% 
from the VGG19, 92% from the VGG16, 97% from the DenseNet121 model, and 90% from 
the custom model.

Intelligence is innate, but grit is something everyone can develop. Grit not 
only enables students to stick to their goals, but also to persevere even when 
they fail. Career adaptability is an important concept in vocational education 
of college students, which is a person engaged in some work, must have a certain 
physical and psychological quality. Base on the self-regulation theory, this 
study investigated the relationship between grit and career adaptability of 
Chinese college student based on the self-regulatory processes. We surveyed 839 
Chinese college students and tested a self-regulation model. As expected, grit 
was related to greater career adaptability via greater career exploration and 
decision self-efficacy, positive affect, and goal commitment. These findings not 
only broaden the theoretical framework for the effect of grit on career 
adaptability, but also open up a new horizon for improving college students' 
career adaptability in practice.

The rate of learning and cognitive development is at its highest level in 
preschool-aged children, making this stage a critical period. Exercise has 
received increasing attention for its beneficial physical and mental health 
effects on the development of preschool children. This study investigated the 
effects of diverse exercise on the cognition of preschool children. Two classes 
were randomly selected from kindergarten classes of children aged 5-6 years, and 
designated as the experimental and control classes. Each class contained 20 
children (10 boys and 10 girls) according to the kindergarten class system. The 
experimental class completed exercises according to the designed curriculum, 
while control class carried out exercises according to the regular teaching 
plan, for a study period of 12 weeks. The Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale 
of Intelligence (WPPSI) and the Mental Health Questionnaire for Children were 
used to assess outcomes, both at the beginning and end of study. After 12 weeks, 
the experimental class has improved in the "Object Assembly," "Block Design," 
"Picture Completion," and "Coding" (14.70 ± 2.14, p < 0.01; 14.54 ± 1.56, p < 
0.01; 9.62 ± 2.06, p < 0.05; 15.92 ± 2.72, p < 0.05) in performance test, and 
showed improvements in the "Movement," "Cognitive Ability," "Sociality" and 
"Living Habits" (5.65 ± 0.59, p < 0.01; 11.20 ± 1.91, p < 0.05; 9.05 ± 1.72, p < 
0.05; 7.10 ± 1.45, p < 0.05) in mental health outcomes. Diverse exercise has a 
significantly beneficial role in promoting the cognitive development of children 
aged 5-6 years, as well as a beneficial, albeit insignificant, role in their 
mental health.

Background: Social communication (SC) includes the use and interpretation of 
verbal and non-verbal messages within a social context and thus requires more 
than knowledge of language. Social communication skills are essential for 
connecting and engaging with others, and SC deficits are often associated with 
emotional and behavioral problems. There is a lack of feasible instruments for 
assessing SC skills in individuals with intellectual disability (ID). Methods: A 
questionnaire on social communication in adults with ID (QSC-ID) comprising 20 
Likert-scaled items was developed and completed on behalf of participants (n = 
52) from three Austrian therapeutic living communities for people with ID and 
deafness by their living- and working-facility key caregivers. The sample of 
adults with hearing loss was considered ideal for the development of a measure 
of SC that is not restricted to a specific communication mode or overly related 
with language skills. Results: The preliminary results showed high construct 
validity. Correlations were high between SC and language, social skills, and 
severity of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), moderate between SC and adaptive 
skills, and non-verbal intelligence and, as expected, low between SC and motor 
skills. Interrater reliability was found to be good or at least acceptable for 
all items. Total raw scores were well-distributed over the whole range-Cut-offs 
based on the 10th and 20th percentile are suggested to identify atypical and 
borderline SC skills. Caregiver feedback and completeness of data suggest that 
the questionnaire is highly feasible. Conclusion: Questionnaire on social 
communication in adults with ID is an easy-to-use caregiver-reported 
questionnaire for use with individuals with mild to severe forms of ID. Initial 
testing of validity looks promising. Further validation in populations with 
typical hearing is required. Due to substantial correlations between SC and 
structural language skills the calculation of specific SC cut-offs for different 
levels of linguistic skills should be considered when sufficient data is 
available.

Low socioeconomic status (SES) may generally have a long-lasting negative effect 
on cognitive development, and show deficits in the development of executive 
functions. However, it is unclear whether there is an SES-dependent disparity in 
the functional brain development of the prefrontal cortex. By collecting 
task-related functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) data and behavioral 
data (e.g., intelligence, language, home reading environment (HRE), family 
income, and parental education level), the current study aimed to detect whether 
the SES of preschool children (N = 86) is associated with prefrontal activation 
during the joint attention task. Results verified that low-SES children show 
lower right prefrontal activation during joint attention than Relatively 
High-SES children. In addition, our findings confirmed the mediating effect of 
HRE on the association between SES and brain activation during joint attention, 
as well as that between SES and language ability. These results suggest that SES 
contributes to functional development of the prefrontal regions, and the 
improvement of HRE could be a potential strategy to intervene SES-related 
disparities on child development.

Mobile health (mHealth) technologies, such as symptom tracking apps, are crucial 
for coping with the global pandemic crisis by providing near real-time, in situ 
information for the medical and governmental response. However, in such a 
dynamic and diverse environment, methods are still needed to support public 
health decision-making. This paper uses the lens of strong structuration theory 
to investigate networks of COVID-19 symptoms in the Belfast metropolitan area. A 
self-supervised machine learning method measuring information entropy was 
applied to the Northern Ireland COVIDCare app. The findings reveal: (1) relevant 
stratifications of disease symptoms, (2) particularities in health-wealth 
networks, and (3) the predictive potential of artificial intelligence to extract 
entangled knowledge from data in COVID-related apps. The proposed method proved 
to be effective for near real-time in-situ analysis of COVID-19 progression and 
to focus and complement public health decisions. Our contribution is relevant to 
an understanding of SARS-COV-2 symptom entanglements in localised environments. 
It can assist decision-makers in designing both reactive and proactive health 
measures that should be personalised to the heterogeneous needs of different 
populations. Moreover, near real-time assessment of pandemic symptoms using 
digital technologies will be critical to create early warning systems of 
emerging SARS-CoV-2 strains and predict the need for healthcare resources.

Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, 500 032 India.

Research in molecular sciences witnessed the rise and fall of Artificial 
Intelligence (AI)/ Machine Learning (ML) methods, especially artificial neural 
networks, few decades ago. However, we see a major resurgence in the use of 
modern ML methods in scientific research during the last few years. These 
methods have had phenomenal success in the areas of computer vision, speech 
recognition, natural language processing (NLP), etc. This has inspired chemists 
and biologists to apply these algorithms to problems in natural sciences. 
Availability of high performance Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) accelerators, 
large datasets, new algorithms, and libraries has enabled this surge. ML 
algorithms have successfully been applied to various domains in molecular 
sciences by providing much faster and sometimes more accurate solutions compared 
to traditional methods like Quantum Mechanical (QM) calculations, Density 
Functional Theory (DFT) or Molecular Mechanics (MM) based methods, etc. Some of 
the areas where the potential of ML methods are shown to be effective are in 
drug design, prediction of high-level quantum mechanical energies, molecular 
design, molecular dynamics materials, and retrosynthesis of organic compounds, 
etc. This article intends to conceptually introduce various modern ML methods 
and their relevance and applications in computational natural sciences. Synopsis 
Recent surge in the application of machine learning (ML) methods in fundamental 
sciences has led to a perspective that these methods may become important tools 
in chemical science. This perspective provides an overview of the modern ML 
methods and their successful applications in chemistry during the last few 
years.

The cornerstone of any successful organizations is the frontline employees. 
Frontline employees (FLEs) are always in action at the frontline of the 
business. They do not operate from the office space or from the corporate 
setting. Frontline employees directly interact with their customers. During the 
COVID-19 pandemic, many frontline employees experienced numerous challenges as 
most of the places there were full or partial lockdown imposed by the government 
agencies and the frontline employees could not be able to directly connect with 
their customers. Not many studies are there which investigated the issue of 
resource integration, dynamic capabilities, and engineering management abilities 
of the frontline employees such as technological capability, emotional 
intelligence, and psychological capability which perceived to influence the 
frontline employee adaptability and organization performance. In this 
background, the purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between 
frontline employee adaptability and organization performance during COVID-19 
pandemic from technological, emotional, and psychological perspectives. With the 
help of dynamic capability view and different adaptability theories, a 
theoretical model has been developed conceptually. Later the conceptual model 
has been validated using partial least square - structural equation modeling 
technique considering 412 respondents from frontline employees of different 
organizations in Asia and EMEA. The study found that frontline employees' 
dynamic capabilities and engineering management abilities significantly and 
positively impact employee adaptability which in turn impact the performance of 
the organization mediating through employee job satisfaction and employee 
performance.

BACKGROUND: The Trauma Outcomes Predictor tool was recently derived using a 
machine learning methodology called optimal classification trees and validated 
for prediction of outcomes in trauma patients. The Trauma Outcomes Predictor is 
available as an interactive smartphone application. In this study, we sought to 
assess the performance of the Trauma Outcomes Predictor in the elderly trauma 
patient.
METHODS: All patients aged 65 years and older in the American College of 
Surgeons-Trauma Quality Improvement Program 2017 database were included. The 
performance of the Trauma Outcomes Predictor in predicting in-hospital mortality 
and combined and specific morbidity based on incidence of 9 specific in-hospital 
complications was assessed using the c-statistic methodology, with planned 
subanalyses for patients 65 to 74, 75 to 84, and 85+ years.
RESULTS: A total of 260,505 patients were included. Median age was 77 (71-84) 
years, 57% were women, and 98.8% had a blunt mechanism of injury. The Trauma 
Outcomes Predictor accurately predicted mortality in all patients, with 
excellent performance for penetrating trauma (c-statistic: 0.92) and good 
performance for blunt trauma (c-statistic: 0.83). Its best performance was in 
patients 65 to 74 years (c-statistic: blunt 0.86, penetrating 0.93). Among blunt 
trauma patients, the Trauma Outcomes Predictor had the best discrimination for 
predicting acute respiratory distress syndrome (c-statistic 0.75) and cardiac 
arrest requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation (c-statistic 0.75). Among 
penetrating trauma patients, the Trauma Outcomes Predictor had the best 
discrimination for deep and organ space surgical site infections (c-statistics 
0.95 and 0.84, respectively).
CONCLUSION: The Trauma Outcomes Predictor is a novel, interpretable, and highly 
accurate predictor of in-hospital mortality in the elderly trauma patient up to 
age 85 years. The Trauma Outcomes Predictor could prove useful for bedside 
counseling of elderly patients and their families and for benchmarking the 
quality of geriatric trauma care.

Since the coronavirus disease has been declared a global pandemic, it had posed 
a challenge among researchers and raised common awareness and collaborative 
efforts towards finding the solution. Caused by severe acute respiratory 
coronavirus syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2), coronavirus drug design strategy needs to 
be optimized. It is understandable that cognizance of the pathobiology of 
COVID-19 can help scientists in the development and discovery of therapeutically 
effective antiviral drugs by elucidating the unknown viral pathways and 
structures. Considering the role of artificial intelligence and machine learning 
with its advancements in the field of science, it is rational to use these 
methods which can aid in the discovery of new potent candidates in silico. Our 
review utilizes similar methodologies and focuses on RNA-dependent RNA 
polymerase (RdRp), based on its importance as an essential element for virus 
replication and also a promising target for COVID-19 therapeutics. Artificial 
neural network technique was used to shortlist articles with the support of 
PRISMA, from different research platforms including Scopus, PubMed, PubChem, and 
Web of Science, through a combination of keywords. "English language", from the 
year "2000" and "published articles in journals" were selected to carry out this 
research. We summarized that structural details of the RdRp reviewed in this 
analysis will have the potential to be taken into consideration when developing 
therapeutic solutions and if further multidisciplinary efforts are taken in this 
domain then potential clinical candidates for RdRp of SARS-CoV-2 could be 
successfully delivered for experimental validations.

Epicardial fat tissue (EFT) is a highly metabolically active fat depot 
surrounding the heart and coronary arteries that is related to early 
atherosclerosis and adverse cardiac events. We aimed to investigate the 
relationship between the amount of EFT and preexisting cardiac conduction 
abnormalities (CCAs) and the need for new postinterventional pacemaker in 
patients with severe aortic stenosis planned for transcatheter aortic valve 
implantation (TAVI). A total of 560 consecutive patients (54% female) scheduled 
for TAVI were included in this retrospective study. EFT volume was measured via 
a fully automated artificial intelligence software (QFAT) using computed 
tomography (CT) performed before TAVI. Baseline CCAs [first-degree 
atrioventricular (AV) block, right bundle branch block (RBBB), and left bundle 
branch block (LBBB)] were diagnosed according to 12-lead ECG before TAVI. Aortic 
valve calcification was determined by the Agatston score assessed in the 
pre-TAVI CT. The median EFT volume was 129.5 ml [IQR 94-170]. Baseline 
first-degree AV block was present in 17%, RBBB in 10.4%, and LBBB in 10.2% of 
the overall cohort. In adjusted logistic regression analysis, higher EFT volume 
was associated with first-degree AV block (OR 1.006 [95% CI 1.002-1.010]; 
p = 0.006) and the need for new pacemaker implantation after TAVI (OR 1.005 [95% 
CI 1.0-1.01]; p = 0.035) but not with the presence of RBBB or LBBB. EFT volume 
did not correlate with the Agatston score of the aortic valve. Greater EFT 
volume is associated independently with preexisting first-degree AV block and 
new pacemaker implantation in patients undergoing TAVI. It may play a causative 
role in degenerative processes and the susceptibility of the AV conduction 
system.

Proteins interact through their interfaces to fulfill essential functions in the 
cell. They bind to their partners in a highly specific manner and form complexes 
that have a profound effect on understanding the biological pathways they are 
involved in. Any abnormal interactions may cause diseases. Therefore, the 
identification of small molecules which modulate protein interactions through 
their interfaces has high therapeutic potential. However, discovering such 
molecules is challenging. Most protein-protein binding affinity is attributed to 
a small set of amino acids found in protein interfaces known as hot spots. 
Recent studies demonstrate that drug-like small molecules specifically may bind 
to hot spots. Therefore, hot spot prediction is crucial. As experimental data 
accumulates, artificial intelligence begins to be used for computational hot 
spot prediction. First, we review machine learning and deep learning for 
computational hot spot prediction and then explain the significance of hot spots 
toward drug design.

Primary care is the largest healthcare delivery platform in the US. Facing the 
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning technology (AI/ML) revolution, the 
primary care community would benefit from a roadmap revealing priority areas and 
opportunities for developing and integrating AI/ML-driven clinical tools. This 
article presents a framework that identifies five domains for AI/ML integration 
in primary care to support care delivery transformation and achieve the 
Quintuple Aims of the healthcare system. We concluded that primary care plays a 
critical role in developing, introducing, implementing, and monitoring AI/ML 
tools in healthcare and must not be overlooked as AI/ML transforms healthcare.

Intracellular calcium ion (Ca2+) in cytoplasm as an intracellular second 
messenger is involved in almost all important cellular activities of organisms. 
Generally its concentration ([Ca2+]i) is tested by live imaging followed image 
and data processes, in which much tedious and subjective manual work is 
involved. Here we show a computational approach of Deep Calcium following the 
principles of deep learning to predict the cytoplasmic Ca2+ ranges and calcium 
peaks in calcium curve of objective cells. To validate Deep Calcium, 
chondrocytes, bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) and osteoblastic like cells 
(MC3T3-E1) from both the tissue and cell samples as well as from spontaneous and 
mechanical stimulated calcium response patterns are used. The good performance 
comparing with other relative machine learning models, as well as consistency 
biological results with human experts are demonstrated. Deep Calcium provides 
references for other image and data processes of intracellular range 
determination and curve peak identification.

We hypothesize that artificial intelligence (AI) applied to relevant clinical 
testing in glaucoma has the potential to enhance the ability to detect glaucoma. 
This premise was discussed at the recent Collaborative Community on Ophthalmic 
Imaging meeting, "The Future of Artificial Intelligence-Enabled Ophthalmic Image 
Interpretation: Accelerating Innovation and Implementation Pathways," held 
virtually September 3-4, 2020. The Collaborative Community on Ophthalmic Imaging 
(CCOI) is an independent self-governing consortium of stakeholders with broad 
international representation from academic institutions, government agencies, 
and the private sector whose mission is to act as a forum for the purpose of 
helping speed innovation in healthcare technology. It was 1 of the first 2 such 
organizations officially designated by the Food and Drug Administration in 
September 2019 in response to their announcement of the collaborative community 
program as a strategic priority for 2018-2020. Further information on the CCOI 
can be found online at their website (https://www.cc-oi.org/about). Artificial 
intelligence for glaucoma diagnosis would have high utility globally, because 
access to care is limited in many parts of the world and half of all people with 
glaucoma are unaware of their illness. The application of AI technology to 
glaucoma diagnosis has the potential to broadly increase access to care 
worldwide, in essence flattening the Earth by providing expert-level evaluation 
to individuals even in the most remote regions of the planet.

BACKGROUND: Psychotic experiences emerge from abnormalities in perception and 
belief formation and occur more commonly in those experiencing childhood trauma. 
However, which precise aspects of belief formation are atypical in psychosis is 
not well understood. We used a computational modeling approach to characterize 
belief updating in young adults in the general population, examine their 
relationship with psychotic outcomes and trauma, and determine the extent to 
which they mediate the trauma-psychosis relationship.
METHODS: We used data from 3360 individuals from the Avon Longitudinal Study of 
Parents and Children birth cohort who completed assessments for psychotic 
outcomes, depression, anxiety, and two belief updating tasks at age 24 and had 
data available on traumatic events assessed from birth to late adolescence. 
Unadjusted and adjusted regression and counterfactual mediation methods were 
used for the analyses.
RESULTS: Basic behavioral measures of belief updating (draws-to-decision and 
disconfirmatory updating) were not associated with psychotic experiences. 
However, computational modeling revealed an association between increased 
decision noise with both psychotic experiences and trauma exposure, although <3% 
of the trauma-psychotic experience association was mediated by decision noise. 
Belief updating measures were also associated with intelligence and 
sociodemographic characteristics, confounding most of the associations with 
psychotic experiences. There was little evidence that belief updating parameters 
were differentially associated with delusions compared with hallucinations or 
that they were differentially associated with psychotic outcomes compared with 
depression or anxiety.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings challenge the hypothesis that atypical belief 
updating mechanisms (as indexed by the computational models and behavioral 
measures we used) underlie the development of psychotic phenomena.

INTRODUCTION: The treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm relies on surgical 
repair and the indication mainly depends on its size evaluated by the maximal 
diameter (Dmax). The aim of this study was to evaluate a new automatic method 
based on artificial intelligence to measure the Dmax on computed tomography 
angiography.
METHODS: A fully automatic segmentation of the vascular system was performed 
using a hybrid method combining expert system with supervised deep learning. The 
aorta centreline was extracted from the segmented aorta and the aortic diameters 
were automatically calculated. Results were compared to manual segmentation 
performed by two human operators.
RESULTS: The median absolute error between the two human operators was 1.2 mm 
(IQR 0.5-1.9). The automatic method using the deep learning algorithm 
demonstrated correlation with the human segmentation, with a median absolute 
error of 0.8 (0.5-4.2) mm and a coefficient correlation of 0.91 (P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Although validation in larger cohorts is required, this method 
brings perspectives to develop new tools to standardize and automate the 
measurement of abdominal aortic aneurysm Dmax in order to help clinicians in the 
decision-making process.

INTRODUCTION: India reported a severe public health challenge not only due to 
the COVID-19 outbreak but also the increasing number of associated mucormycosis 
cases since 2021.This study aimed at developing artificial intelligence based 
models to predict the risk of mucormycosis among the patients at the time of 
discharge from hospital.
METHODS: The dataset included of 1229 COVID-19 positive patients, and additional 
214 inpatients, COVID-19 positive as well as infected with mucormycosis. We used 
logistic regression, decision tree and random forest and the extreme gradient 
boosting algorithm. All our models were evaluated with 5-fold validation to 
derive a reliable estimate of the model error.
RESULTS: The logistic regression, XGBoost and random forest performed equally 
well with AUROC 95.0, 94.0, and 94.0 respectively. The best accuracy and 
precision (PPV) were 0.91 ± 0.026 and 0.67 ± 0.0526, respectively achieved by 
XGBoost, followed by logistic regression. This study also determined top five 
variables namely obesity, anosmia, de novo diabetes, myalgia, and nasal 
discharge, which showed positive impact towards the risk of mucormycosis.
CONCLUSION: The developed model has the potential to predict the patients at 
high risk and thus, consequently initiating preventive care or aiding in early 
detection of mucormycosis infection. Thus, this study, holds potential for early 
treatment and better management of patients suffering from COVID-19 associated 
mucormycosis.

Driver mutations promote initiation and progression of cancer. Pharmacological 
treatment can inhibit the action of the mutant protein; however, drug resistance 
almost invariably emerges. Multiple studies revealed that cancer drug resistance 
is based upon a plethora of distinct mechanisms. Drug resistance mutations can 
occur in the same protein or in different proteins; as well as in the same 
pathway or in parallel pathways, bypassing the intercepted signaling. The 
dilemma that the clinical oncologist is facing is that not all the genomic 
alterations as well as alterations in the tumor microenvironment that facilitate 
cancer cell proliferation are known, and neither are the alterations that are 
likely to promote metastasis. For example, the common KRasG12C driver mutation 
emerges in different cancers. Most occur in NSCLC, but some occur, albeit to a 
lower extent, in colorectal cancer and pancreatic ductal carcinoma. The 
responses to KRasG12C inhibitors are variable and fall into three categories, 
(i) new point mutations in KRas, or multiple copies of KRAS G12C which lead to 
higher expression level of the mutant protein; (ii) mutations in genes other 
than KRAS; (iii) original cancer transitioning to other cancer(s). Resistance to 
adagrasib, an experimental antitumor agent exerting its cytotoxic effect as a 
covalent inhibitor of the G12C KRas, indicated that half of the cases present 
multiple KRas mutations as well as allele amplification. Redundant or parallel 
pathways included MET amplification; emerging driver mutations in NRAS, BRAF, 
MAP2K1, and RET; gene fusion events in ALK, RET, BRAF, RAF1, and FGFR3; and 
loss-of-function mutations in NF1 and PTEN tumor suppressors. In the current 
review we discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying drug resistance while 
focusing on those emerging to common targeted cancer drivers. We also address 
questions of why cancers with a common driver mutation are unlikely to evolve a 
common drug resistance mechanism, and whether one can predict the likely 
mechanisms that the tumor cell may develop. These vastly important and 
tantalizing questions in drug discovery, and broadly in precision medicine, are 
the focus of our present review. We end with our perspective, which calls for 
target combinations to be selected and prioritized with the help of the emerging 
massive compute power which enables artificial intelligence, and the increased 
gathering of data to overcome its insatiable needs.

This article presents a systematic overview of artificial intelligence (AI) and 
computer vision strategies for diagnosing the coronavirus disease of 2019 
(COVID-19) using computerized tomography (CT) medical images. We analyzed the 
previous review works and found that all of them ignored classifying and 
categorizing COVID-19 literature based on computer vision tasks, such as 
classification, segmentation, and detection. Most of the COVID-19 CT diagnosis 
methods comprehensively use segmentation and classification tasks. Moreover, 
most of the review articles are diverse and cover CT as well as X-ray images. 
Therefore, we focused on the COVID-19 diagnostic methods based on CT images. 
Well-known search engines and databases such as Google, Google Scholar, Kaggle, 
Baidu, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Scopus were 
utilized to collect relevant studies. After deep analysis, we collected 114 
studies and reported highly enriched information for each selected research. 
According to our analysis, AI and computer vision have substantial potential for 
rapid COVID-19 diagnosis as they could significantly assist in automating the 
diagnosis process. Accurate and efficient models will have real-time clinical 
implications, though further research is still required. Categorization of 
literature based on computer vision tasks could be helpful for future research; 
therefore, this review article will provide a good foundation for conducting 
such research.

Apoptosis plays an essential role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and 
preventing cancer progression. Bcl-xL, an anti-apoptotic protein, is an 
important modulator of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway and is a promising 
target for anticancer therapy. In this study, we identified octenidine as a 
novel Bcl-xL inhibitor through structural feature-based deep learning and 
molecular docking from a library of approved drugs. The NMR experiments 
demonstrated that octenidine binds to the Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) domain-binding 
hydrophobic region that consists of the BH1, BH2, and BH3 domains in Bcl-xL. A 
structural model of the Bcl-xL/octenidine complex revealed that octenidine binds 
to Bcl-xL in a similar manner to that of the well-known Bcl-2 family protein 
antagonist ABT-737. Using the NanoBiT protein-protein interaction system, we 
confirmed that the interaction between Bcl-xL and Bak-BH3 domains within cells 
was inhibited by octenidine. Furthermore, octenidine inhibited the proliferation 
of MCF-7 breast and H1299 lung cancer cells by promoting apoptosis. Taken 
together, our results shed light on a novel mechanism in which octenidine 
directly targets anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL to trigger mitochondrial apoptosis in 
cancer cells.

Aifred is a clinical decision support system (CDSS) that uses artificial 
intelligence to assist physicians in selecting treatments for major depressive 
disorder (MDD) by providing probabilities of remission for different treatment 
options based on patient characteristics. We evaluated the utility of the CDSS 
as perceived by physicians participating in simulated clinical interactions. 
Twenty physicians who were either staff or residents in psychiatry or family 
medicine completed a study in which they had three 10-minute clinical 
interactions with standardized patients portraying mild, moderate, and severe 
episodes of MDD. During these scenarios, physicians were given access to the 
CDSS, which they could use in their treatment decisions. The perceived utility 
of the CDSS was assessed through self-report questionnaires, scenario 
observations, and interviews. 60% of physicians perceived the CDSS to be a 
useful tool in their treatment-selection process, with family physicians 
perceiving the greatest utility. Moreover, 50% of physicians would use the tool 
for all patients with depression, with an additional 35% noting that they would 
reserve the tool for more severe or treatment-resistant patients. Furthermore, 
clinicians found the tool to be useful in discussing treatment options with 
patients. The efficacy of this CDSS and its potential to improve treatment 
outcomes must be further evaluated in clinical trials.

Bilateral breast cancer (BBC) is rare and is associated with an unfavorable 
prognosis. Consequently it is crucial to improve diagnostic performance of 
breast cancer in the clinical setting. We report a case of BBC in a 66-year-old 
woman and describe the imaging findings, including mammography, hand-held 
ultrasound, automated breast ultrasound, anatomical intelligence for breast 
ultrasound (AI-breast), and magnetic resonance imaging. Only AI-breast 
ultrasound successfully located the two tumors, while other imaging examinations 
failed to detect the tumor in the right breast.

BACKGROUND: From traditional open surgery to laparoscopic surgery and 
robot-assisted surgery, advances in robotics, machine learning, and imaging are 
pushing the surgical approach to-wards better clinical outcomes. Pre-clinical 
and clinical evidence suggests that automation may standardise techniques, 
increase efficiency, and reduce clinical complications.
METHODS: A PRISMA-guided search was conducted across PubMed and OVID.
RESULTS: Of the 89 screened articles, 51 met the inclusion criteria, with 10 
included in the final review. Automatic data segmentation, trajectory planning, 
intra-operative registration, trajectory drilling, and soft tissue robotic 
surgery were discussed.
CONCLUSION: Although automated surgical systems remain conceptual, several 
research groups have developed supervised autonomous robotic surgical systems 
with increasing consideration for ethico-legal issues for automation. Automation 
paves the way for precision surgery and improved safety and opens new 
possibilities for deploying more robust artificial intelligence models, better 
imaging modalities and robotics to improve clinical outcomes.

BACKGROUND: To prove the concept of diagnosing primary hyperparathyroidism 
(pHPT) without calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) values and identifying 
potential risk factors for pHPT.
METHODS: Data were extracted from the clinical data warehouse (CDW) at the 
University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) Epic EHR (2014-2019).
RESULTS: 1737 patients with over 185 000 rows of clinical data were provided in 
a relational structure and processed/flattened to facilitate modeling. Phenotype 
elements were identified for pHPT without advance knowledge of calcium and PTH 
levels. The area under the curve (AUC) for the prediction of pHPT using our 
model was 0.86 with sensitivity and specificity of 0.8953 and 0.6686, 
respectively, using a 0.45 probability threshold.
CONCLUSION: Primary hyperparathyroidism was predicted from a dataset excluding 
calcium and PTH data with 86% accuracy. This approach needs to be 
validated/refined on larger samples of data and plans are in place to do this 
with other regional/national datasets.

OBJECTIVE: A group of surgeons and a medical educator constructed a curriculum 
to strengthen communication and emotional intelligence skills in the surgical 
setting.
DESIGN: The curriculum consisted of a small group discussion series occurring 
during medical students' eight-week surgery clerkship. The curriculum targeted 
the following objectives: building team rapport, exploring self-management 
strategies in team communication, recognizing communication styles, diagnosing 
conflict, identifying opportunities in professional and personal development, 
and discussing professionalism in medicine. Students completed pre-post Likert 
style tests about their knowledge and understanding of the above-mentioned 
topics.
SETTING: Texas A&M University College of Medicine, Surgical Clerkship at Baylor 
Scott and White Medical Center, a level 1 trauma center, in Temple, TX.
PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-four students in their third year of medical school 
completed the communication curriculum.
RESULTS: Wilcoxon sign test was used to analyze the non-parametric data and 
multiple repeat tests required the significance level (p-Value) be adjusted to 
0.003. Students showed significant increase in understanding of conflict 
management, their ability to communicate effectively, and their awareness of 
communication preferences (p < 0.001). In addition, they recognized better ways 
to engage with other students, residents, and staff on their rotation 
(p = 0.002) and felt more confident in their ability to handle feedback 
(p = 0.001). Open-ended responses on the post-test had overwhelmingly positive 
feedback with themes of awareness, psychological safety, and team rapport. 
Finally, students requested that the curriculum be taught longitudinally 
throughout their third-year clerkships.
CONCLUSIONS: Our curriculum enabled students to improve their awareness of 
communication, conflict management, team dynamics, and professionalism. These 
important competencies will support students throughout their training and in 
their practice as future surgeons.

BACKGROUND: Although the context of parenting has been incorporated into 
psychosocial pain research, very little attention has been paid to how parenting 
styles influence chronic pain in adolescents. The present study aimed to 
investigate the mediating role of self-esteem, emotional intelligence, and 
psychological distress in the association between parenting styles and chronic 
pain.
METHOD: Seven hundred and thirty nine adolescents and their parents participated 
in this study. To identify adolescents with chronic pain, screening questions 
based on the 11th revision of the International Classification of Diseases were 
used. Baumrind parenting style questionnaire was used to assess the parenting 
style (permissive, authoritarian, and authoritative parenting styles). The 
structural equation modelling (SEM) was carried out in M-Plus version 6 to 
evaluate the direct, indirect, and total effects of different parenting styles 
on chronic pain.
RESULTS: The results in the SEM models revealed that only the indirect paths 
from authoritative and authoritarian parenting styles to pain through emotional 
intelligence (βauthoritative = - 0.003, 95% CI = - 0.008 to - 0.003; 
βauthoritarian = 0.001, 95% CI = 0.001 to 0.003) and psychological distress 
(βauthoritative = - 0.010, 95% CI = - 0.021 to - 0.004; βauthoritarian = 0.008, 
95% CI = 0.004 to 0.016) were significant. Indirect paths from permissive style 
to pain and the mediating role of self-esteem were not significant.
DISCUSSION: Emotional intelligence and psychological distress significantly 
mediated the effects of authoritative and authoritarian parenting styles on 
chronic pain. The current results support the notion that interventions 
targeting effective parent-adolescent communication may be an important part of 
chronic pain management in adolescents. Moreover, the results provide rationale 
for targeting emotional intelligence and psychological distress in adolescents 
by explicitly teaching effective communication skills, expressing opinions and 
minds, and emotion regulation strategies.

OBJECTIVE: The use of benchtop metabolic profiling technology based on nuclear 
magnetic resonance (NMR) was evaluated in a small cohort of cats with a view to 
applying this as a viable and rapid metabolic tool to support clinical decision 
making.
RESULTS: Urinary metabolites were analysed from four subjects consisting of two 
healthy controls and two chronic kidney disease (CKD) IRIS stage 2 cases. The 
study identified 15 metabolites in cats with CKD that were different from the 
controls. Among them were acetate, creatinine, citrate, taurine, glycine, serine 
and threonine. Benchtop NMR technology is capable of distinguishing between 
chronic kidney disease case and control samples in a pilot feline cohort based 
on metabolic profile. We offer perspectives on the further development of this 
pilot work and the potential of the technology, when combined with sample 
databases and computational intelligence techniques to offer a clinical decision 
support tool not only for cases of renal disease but other metabolic conditions 
in the future.

Ever-increasing demands for freshwater resources have elevated the likelihood of 
severe water stress in several places of Saudi Arabia during the last several 
decades. With effective decision-making processes, development objectives on 
water resource management emerge. In the following series of research articles, 
recent innovations in various objective demand forecasting systems are examined 
and contrasted in terms of their utility in resolving tough challenges in water 
resource management. Hence, this study proposes a novel approach to water 
resource management integrating Multi-Criteria Optimization and Intelligent 
Water Demand Forecasting (MCO-IWDF). This framework addresses the challenges in 
allocating various water resources to multiple water sectors in a future 
changing environment. In order to plan for future water needs, water managers 
use a variety of tools. When forecasting future water demand, the most common 
method is to estimate current per-capita consumption (gpcd) and multiply this by 
the expected population growth. Conserving water in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 
to improve irrigation issues. This research analyzes the current situation of 
available water resources and the water demand in Saudi Arabia. The machine 
intelligence and big data analytic approach improve the proposed water resource 
management scheme. The simulation analysis identifies the highest performance in 
demand prediction accuracy of 98.96% and optimization ratio of 97.87% compared 
to the existing models. Over time, a mathematical model is used to conduct 
simulation experiments. Studying the problem, creating a model and collecting 
data are just some of the steps involved in simulation research. Response 
analysis and a simulation report are also part of this process. The case study 
analysis results in a significant satisfactory level of 99.23%.

Limited access to assistive technology (AT) is a well-recognized global 
challenge. Emerging technologies have potential to develop new assistive 
products and bridge some of the gaps in access to AT. However, limited analyses 
exist on the potential of these technologies in the AT field. This paper 
describes a study that aimed to provide an overview of emerging technological 
developments and their potential for the AT field. It involved conducting a gray 
literature review and patent analysis to create an overview of the emerging 
enabling technologies that may foster the development of new AT products and 
services and identify emerging AT applications. The analysis identified seven 
enabling technologies that are relevant to the AT field. These are artificial 
intelligence, emerging human-computer interfaces, sensor technology, robotics, 
advances in connectivity and computing, additive manufacturing and new 
materials. Whilst there are over 3.7 million patents related to these enabling 
technologies, only a fraction of them - 11,000 patents were identified in the 
analysis specifically related to AT (0.3%). The paper presents some of the 
promising examples. Overall, the results indicate that there is an enormous 
potential for new AT solutions that capitalize on emerging technological 
advances.

BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) develops in 4% of hospitalized patients 
and is a marker of clinical deterioration and nephrotoxicity. AKI onset is 
highly variable in hospitals, which makes it difficult to time biomarker 
assessment in all patients for preemptive care.
OBJECTIVE: The study sought to apply machine learning techniques to electronic 
health records and predict hospital-acquired AKI by a 48-hour lead time, with 
the aim to create an AKI surveillance algorithm that is deployable in real time.
METHODS: The data were sourced from 20,732 case admissions in 16,288 patients 
over 1 year in our institution. We enhanced the bidirectional recurrent neural 
network model with a novel time-invariant and time-variant aggregated module to 
capture important clinical features temporal to AKI in every patient. 
Time-series features included laboratory parameters that preceded a 48-hour 
prediction window before AKI onset; the latter's corresponding reference was the 
final in-hospital serum creatinine performed in case admissions without AKI 
episodes.
RESULTS: The cohort was of mean age 53 (SD 25) years, of whom 29%, 12%, 12%, and 
53% had diabetes, ischemic heart disease, cancers, and baseline eGFR <90 
mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively. There were 911 AKI episodes in 869 patients. We 
derived and validated an algorithm in the testing dataset with an AUROC of 0.81 
(0.78-0.85) for predicting AKI. At a 15% prediction threshold, our model 
generated 699 AKI alerts with 2 false positives for every true AKI and predicted 
26% of AKIs. A lowered 5% prediction threshold improved the recall to 60% but 
generated 3746 AKI alerts with 6 false positives for every true AKI. 
Representative interpretation results produced by our model alluded to the 
top-ranked features that predicted AKI that could be categorized in association 
with sepsis, acute coronary syndrome, nephrotoxicity, or multiorgan injury, 
specific to every case at risk.
CONCLUSIONS: We generated an accurate algorithm from electronic health records 
through machine learning that predicted AKI by a lead time of at least 48 hours. 
The prediction threshold could be adjusted during deployment to optimize recall 
and minimize alert fatigue, while its precision could potentially be augmented 
by targeted AKI biomarker assessment in the high-risk cohort identified.

Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging is a non-invasive technique used for the 
evaluation of tissue vascularity features through imaging series acquisition 
after contrast medium administration. Over the years, the study technique and 
protocols have evolved, seeing a growing application of this method across 
different imaging modalities for the study of almost all body districts. The 
main and most consolidated current applications concern MRI imaging for the 
study of tumors, but an increasing number of studies are evaluating the use of 
this technique also for inflammatory pathologies and functional studies. 
Furthermore, the recent advent of artificial intelligence techniques is opening 
up a vast scenario for the analysis of quantitative information deriving from 
DCE. The purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive update on the 
techniques, protocols, and clinical applications - both established and emerging 
- of DCE in whole-body imaging.

Chronic diseases are a growing concern worldwide, with nearly 25% of adults 
suffering from one or more chronic health conditions, thus placing a heavy 
burden on individuals, families, and healthcare systems. With the advent of the 
"Smart Healthcare" era, a series of cutting-edge technologies has brought new 
experiences to the management of chronic diseases. Among them, smart wearable 
technology not only helps people pursue a healthier lifestyle but also provides 
a continuous flow of healthcare data for disease diagnosis and treatment by 
actively recording physiological parameters and tracking the metabolic state. 
However, how to organize and analyze the data to achieve the ultimate goal of 
improving chronic disease management, in terms of quality of life, patient 
outcomes, and privacy protection, is an urgent issue that needs to be addressed. 
Artificial intelligence (AI) can provide intelligent suggestions by analyzing a 
patient's physiological data from wearable devices for the diagnosis and 
treatment of diseases. In addition, blockchain can improve healthcare services 
by authorizing decentralized data sharing, protecting the privacy of users, 
providing data empowerment, and ensuring the reliability of data management. 
Integrating AI, blockchain, and wearable technology could optimize the existing 
chronic disease management models, with a shift from a hospital-centered model 
to a patient-centered one. In this paper, we conceptually demonstrate a 
patient-centric technical framework based on AI, blockchain, and wearable 
technology and further explore the application of these integrated technologies 
in chronic disease management. Finally, the shortcomings of this new paradigm 
and future research directions are also discussed.

OBJECTIVES: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many researchers have 
developed artificial intelligence (AI) tools to differentiate COVID-19 pneumonia 
from other conditions in chest CT. However, in many cases, performance has not 
been clinically validated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance 
of commercial AI solutions in differentiating COVID-19 pneumonia from other lung 
conditions.
METHODS: Four commercial AI solutions were evaluated on a dual-center clinical 
dataset consisting of 500 CT studies; COVID-19 pneumonia was microbiologically 
proven in 50 of these. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative 
predictive values, and AUC were calculated. In a subgroup analysis, the 
performance of the AI solutions in differentiating COVID-19 pneumonia from other 
conditions was evaluated in CT studies with ground-glass opacities (GGOs).
RESULTS: Sensitivity and specificity ranges were 62-96% and 31-80%, 
respectively. Negative and positive predictive values ranged between 82-99% and 
19-25%, respectively. AUC was in the range 0.54-0.79. In CT studies with GGO, 
sensitivity remained unchanged. However, specificity was lower, and ranged 
between 15 and 53%. AUC for studies with GGO was in the range 0.54-0.69.
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the variable specificity and low positive 
predictive value of AI solutions in diagnosing COVID-19 pneumonia in chest CT. 
However, one solution yielded acceptable values for sensitivity. Thus, with 
further improvement, commercial AI solutions currently under development have 
the potential to be integrated as alert tools in clinical routine workflow. 
Randomized trials are needed to assess the true benefits and also potential 
harms of the use of AI in image analysis.
KEY POINTS: • Commercial AI solutions achieved a sensitivity and specificity 
ranging from 62 to 96% and from 31 to 80%, respectively, in identifying patients 
suspicious for COVID-19 in a clinical dataset. • Sensitivity remained within the 
same range, while specificity was even lower in subgroup analysis of CT studies 
with ground-glass opacities, and interrater agreement between the commercial AI 
solutions was minimal to nonexistent. • Thus, commercial AI solutions have the 
potential to be integrated as alert tools for the detection of patients with 
lung changes suspicious for COVID-19 pneumonia in a clinical routine workflow, 
if further improvement is made.

PURPOSE: A critical bottleneck for the credibility of artificial intelligence 
(AI) is replicating the results in the diversity of clinical practice. We aimed 
to develop an AI that can be independently applied to recover high-quality 
imaging from low-dose scans on different scanners and tracers.
METHODS: Brain [18F]FDG PET imaging of 237 patients scanned with one scanner was 
used for the development of AI technology. The developed algorithm was then 
tested on [18F]FDG PET images of 45 patients scanned with three different 
scanners, [18F]FET PET images of 18 patients scanned with two different 
scanners, as well as [18F]Florbetapir images of 10 patients. A conditional 
generative adversarial network (GAN) was customized for cross-scanner and 
cross-tracer optimization. Three nuclear medicine physicians independently 
assessed the utility of the results in a clinical setting.
RESULTS: The improvement achieved by AI recovery significantly correlated with 
the baseline image quality indicated by structural similarity index measurement 
(SSIM) (r = -0.71, p < 0.05) and normalized dose acquisition (r = -0.60, p < 
0.05). Our cross-scanner and cross-tracer AI methodology showed utility based on 
both physical and clinical image assessment (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The deep learning development for extensible application on unknown 
scanners and tracers may improve the trustworthiness and clinical acceptability 
of AI-based dose reduction.

Individuals from a diverse range of backgrounds are increasingly engaging in 
research and development in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). The main 
activities, although still nascent, are coalescing around three core activities: 
innovation, policy, and capacity building. Within agriculture, which is the 
focus of this paper, AI is working with converging technologies, particularly 
data optimization, to add value along the entire agricultural value chain, 
including procurement, farm automation, and market access. Our key takeaway is 
that, despite the promising opportunities for development, there are actual and 
potential challenges that African countries need to consider in deciding whether 
to scale up or down the application of AI in agriculture. Input from African 
innovators, policymakers, and academics is essential to ensure that AI solutions 
are aligned with African needs and priorities. This paper proposes questions 
that can be used to form a road map to inform research and development in this 
area.

Colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) have heterogenous histopathological and 
immunohistochemical phenotypes, which are associated with variable responses to 
treatment and outcomes. However, this information is usually only available 
after resection, and therefore of limited value in treatment planning. Improved 
techniques for in vivo disease assessment, which can characterise the variable 
tumour biology, would support further personalization of management strategies. 
Advanced imaging of CRLM including multiparametric MRI and functional imaging 
techniques have the potential to provide clinically-actionable phenotypic 
characterisation. This includes assessment of the tumour-liver interface, 
internal tumour components and treatment response. Advanced analysis techniques, 
including radiomics and machine learning now have a growing role in assessment 
of imaging, providing high-dimensional imaging feature extraction which can be 
linked to clinical relevant tumour phenotypes, such as a the Consensus Molecular 
Subtypes (CMS). In this review, we outline how imaging techniques could 
reproducibly characterize the histopathological features of CRLM, with several 
matched imaging and histology examples to illustrate these features, and discuss 
the oncological relevance of these features. Finally, we discuss the future 
challenges and opportunities of CRLM imaging, with a focus on the potential 
value of advanced analytics including radiomics and artificial intelligence, to 
help inform future research in this rapidly moving field.

OBJECTIVES: The beliefs of laypeople and medical professionals often diverge 
with regards to disease, and technology has had a positive impact on how 
research is conducted. Surprisingly, given the expanding worldwide funding and 
research into Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications in healthcare, there is 
a paucity of research exploring the public patient perspective on this 
technology. Our study sets out to address this knowledge gap, by applying the 
Nominal Group Technique (NGT) to explore patient public views on AI.
METHODS: A Nominal Group Technique (NGT) was used involving four study groups 
with seven participants in each group. This started with a silent generation of 
ideas regarding the benefits and concerns of AI in Healthcare. Then a group 
discussion and round-robin process were conducted until no new ideas were 
generated. Participants ranked their top five benefits and top five concerns 
regarding the use of AI in healthcare. A final group consensus was reached.
RESULTS: Twenty-Eight participants were recruited with the mean age of 47 years. 
The top five benefits were: Faster health services, Greater accuracy in 
management, AI systems available 24/7, reducing workforce burden, and equality 
in healthcare decision making. The top five concerns were: Data cybersecurity, 
bias and quality of AI data, less human interaction, algorithm errors and 
responsibility, and limitation in technology.
CONCLUSION: This is the first formal qualitative study exploring patient public 
views on the use of AI in healthcare, and highlights that there is a clear 
understanding of the potential benefits delivered by this technology. Greater 
patient public group involvement, and a strong regulatory framework is 
recommended.

With rapid advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning 
(ML), automatic modulation classification (AMC) using deep learning (DL) 
techniques has become very popular. This is even more relevant for Internet of 
things (IoT)-assisted wireless systems. This paper presents a lightweight, 
ensemble model with convolution, long short term memory (LSTM), and gated 
recurrent unit (GRU) layers. The proposed model is termed as deep recurrent 
convoluted network with additional gated layer (DRCaG). It has been tested on a 
dataset derived from the RadioML2016(b) and comprises of 8 different modulation 
types named as BPSK, QPSK, 8-PSK, 16-QAM, 4-PAM, CPFSK, GFSK, and WBFM. The 
performance of the proposed model has been presented through extensive 
simulation in terms of training loss, accuracy, and confusion matrix with 
variable signal to noise ratio (SNR) ranging from -20 dB to +20 dB and it 
demonstrates the superiority of DRCaG vis-a-vis existing ones.

Student performance prediction (SPP) aims to evaluate the grade that a student 
will reach before enrolling in a course or taking an exam. This prediction 
problem is a kernel task toward personalized education and has attracted 
increasing attention in the field of artificial intelligence and educational 
data mining (EDM). This paper provides a systematic review of the SPP study from 
the perspective of machine learning and data mining. This review partitions SPP 
into five stages, i.e., data collection, problem formalization, model, 
prediction, and application. To have an intuition on these involved methods, we 
conducted experiments on a data set from our institute and a public data set. 
Our educational dataset composed of 1,325 students, and 832 courses was 
collected from the information system, which represents a typical higher 
education in China. With the experimental results, discussions on current 
shortcomings and interesting future works are finally summarized from data 
collections to practices. This work provides developments and challenges in the 
study task of SPP and facilitates the progress of personalized education.

BACKGROUND: Visual tracking of moving objects requires sustained attention and 
prediction of the object's trajectory. We tested the hypothesis that measures of 
eye-head tracking of moving objects are associated to long-term neurodevelopment 
in very preterm infants.
METHODS: Visual tracking performance was assessed at 4 month's corrected age in 
57 infants with gestational age <32 weeks. An object moved in front of the 
infant with sinusoidal or triangular (i.e. abrupt) turns of the direction. Gaze 
gain, smooth pursuit gain, and timing of gaze to object motion were analyzed. At 
6.5 years the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-IV), the Brown 
Attention Deficit Disorder (Brown ADD), and visual examination were performed.
RESULTS: Gaze gain and smooth pursuit gain at 4 months were strongly related to 
all WISC-IV parameters at 6.5 years. Gaze gain for the triangular and sinusoidal 
motion patterns related similarly to the cognitive scores. For the sinusoidal 
motion pattern, timing related to most Brown ADD parameters. There were no 
statistically significant differences in associations dependent on motion 
pattern. Visual function did not influence the results.
CONCLUSION: The ability to attend to and smoothly track a moving object in 
infancy is an early marker of cognition and attention at 6.5 years.
IMPACT: Potential long-term implications of infant visual tracking of moving 
objects for school-age neurodevelopment has not been previously studied in very 
preterm infants. Early coordination of eye and head movements in gaze gain, 
smooth pursuit, and timing of gaze to object motion are closely associated with 
cognition and attention at 6.5 years. As related functions at 6.5 years include 
perceptual and verbal skills, working memory, processing speed and attention, 
predictive elements in gaze tracking of moving objects might be a suitable 
target for future intervention studies.

Artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning has made much headway in the 
consumer and advertising sector, not only affecting how and what people purchase 
these days, but also affecting behaviour and cultural attitudes. It is poised to 
influence nearly every aspect of our being, and the field of cardiology is not 
an exception. This paper aims to brief the clinician on the advances in AI and 
machine learning in the field of cardiology, its applications, while also 
recognising the potential for future development in these two mammoth fields. 
With the advent of big data, new opportunities are emerging to build AI tools, 
with better accuracy, that will directly aid not only the clinician but also 
allow nations to provide better healthcare to its citizens.

Nidra (sleep), Ahara (food) and Brahmacharya (abstinence) are the three 
sub-pillars of health and alterations in these basic pillars of health can lead 
to mortality and morbidity. Among these, Nidra has a critical role in the 
biological and psychological functioning of the body. The circadian rhythm is 
the physiological machinery that controls and regulates physiological activities 
throughout the 24 hours in conjunction with the day and night. The synchronicity 
of the circadian rhythm and adequate sleep is essential for maintaining normal 
physical and mental health. This study, therefore, was undertaken as a 
descriptive cross-sectional survey to evaluate the impact of Ratrijagarana 
(night wakefulness) on Manasika Bhava (mental characteristics) among industrial 
workers aged between 19 and 25 years from both genders. Maniasika Bhavas were 
assessed using Manasa Bhava Pariksha (MBP), a 20 item questionnaire. The results 
indicate a substantial change in Mana (non-distracted mind), Chinta 
(anxiety/worry), Dhairyam (courage), Harsha (joy), Veeryam (energy), Shraddha 
(desire), Medha (intelligence), Avasthaana (stability of mind), Vignyaana 
(knowledge), Sanjna (recognition), and Smriti (memory). Among these, Sanjna, 
Medha and Mana and Veeryam are most affected, with positive ranks scoring 115, 
107 and 104. Vignyaana, (χ2(6) = 162.031; p = .001) Veerya (χ2(4) = 12.688; 
p = .013) and Shraddha (χ2(6) = 12.558; p = .05) also showed significant 
association with sleeping hours per day. These encouranging results need further 
corroboration through future studies with larger sample size and diverse 
populations.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has wide applications in healthcare, including 
dermatology. Machine learning (ML) is a subfield of AI involving statistical 
models and algorithms that can progressively learn from data to predict the 
characteristics of new samples and perform a desired task. Although it has a 
significant role in the detection of skin cancer, dermatology skill lags behind 
radiology in terms of AI acceptance. With continuous spread, use, and emerging 
technologies, AI is becoming more widely available even to the general 
population. AI can be of use for the early detection of skin cancer. For 
example, the use of deep convolutional neural networks can help to develop a 
system to evaluate images of the skin to diagnose skin cancer. Early detection 
is key for the effective treatment and better outcomes of skin cancer. 
Specialists can accurately diagnose the cancer, however, considering their 
limited numbers, there is a need to develop automated systems that can diagnose 
the disease efficiently to save lives and reduce health and financial burdens on 
the patients. ML can be of significant use in this regard. In this article, we 
discuss the fundamentals of ML and its potential in assisting the diagnosis of 
skin cancer.

This study examines the impact of negative workplace gossip (NWG) on employee 
political acts (PA) and the role of ego depletion (ED) as a mediator. We also 
examined the indirect impact of NWG on PA through ED controlled by emotional 
intelligence (EI). A three-wave time-lagged study (paper-pencil based) was 
performed with 277 employees from various private organisations in Islamabad, 
Pakistan. The current data were gathered in three phases to reduce common method 
bias. Study results indicate that NWG positively affects employees' PA. The 
authors also found ED as a potential mediator in the association between NWG and 
PA. In addition, the results also indicate the indirect effect of NWG on 
targets' PA via ED is reduced by targets' EI, with the result that this 
connection is weak when targets' EI is high. Because this research is limited to 
a single region of Pakistan, particularly Islamabad, its findings cannot be 
comprehensive. Future studies should use a larger sample size to accomplish the 
same study. Future studies may include more organisations (that is, Public) to 
conduct a comparative analysis of the public and private sectors. This article, 
based on the affective events theory (AET), argues that EI should be utilised to 
mitigate the effects of NWG. Along with our significant and relevant theoretical 
contributions, we provide novel insights into the body of knowledge on how 
managers may prevent or minimise such PA. The current study results support all 
direct and indirect hypothesised connections, with important implications for 
theory and practice. A review of the existing literature indicates that EI may 
be associated with a reduction in employees' ED; however, EI has not been used 
as a moderator in mitigating the influence of NWG, ED, and PA in the past.

While the link between sensory-processing sensitivity (SPS) and internalizing 
symptoms has been well-established, a link to externalizing problems is still to 
be explored. This study aimed to further examine the relation between SPS and 
behavioral problems by testing the potential mediating roles of trait emotional 
intelligence (TEI) and decision-making styles. Pathway analyses were conducted 
on data from 268 community sample participants (Mage = 25.81, SD = 2.41, 61.2% 
females). Results indicated gender differences in the pathway level outcomes of 
SPS, as well as potential partial mediators in men and women. SPS both directly 
and via the mediating effects of the well-being factor (TEI) and avoidant 
decision-making influenced depression, regardless of gender. Direct effects on 
aggression were, however, obtained only in the male sample. Indirect effects of 
SPS on aggression were found in spontaneous decision-making for men and in the 
self-control and sociability factors of TEI for women. Directions for future 
research were discussed.

We present the opportunities and challenges of Open Up, a free, 24/7 online 
text-based counselling service to support youth in Hong Kong. The number of 
youths served more than doubled within the first three years since its inception 
in 2018 in response to increasing youth suicidality and mental health needs. 
Good practice models are being developed in order to sustain and further scale 
up the service. We discuss the structure of the operation, usage pattern and its 
effectiveness, the use of AI to improve users experience, and the role of 
volunteer in the operation. We also present the challenges in further enhancing 
the operation, calling for more research, especially on the identification of 
the optimal number of users that can be concurrently served by a counsellor, the 
effective approach to respond to a small percentage of repeated users who has 
taken up a disproportional volume of service, and the way to optimize the use of 
big data analytics and AI technology to enhance the service. These advancements 
will benefit not only Open Up but also similar services across the globe.

Understanding factors that influence academic performances is vital. The aim of 
this study is to longitudinally test, with three timepoints, the unique 
contribution of several predictors to academic performance. In a sample of 796 
Ecuadorian students, dominance analyses were performed with the R program to 
test the relative and unique importance of the seven variables under study 
(verbal aptitude, numerical aptitude, abstract reasoning, emotional regulation 
scenarios, emotional regulation self-questionnaire, and academic performance 
measured in timepoint one and two) for academic performance, measured in 
timepoint three in the entire sample and separately in each of the ten degrees 
in the academic center. Results show that the strongest predictors are past 
academic performance, followed by gender, numerical aptitude, scenarios, verbal 
aptitude, abstract reasoning, and, finally, the emotional regulation 
self-questionnaire. This study contributes to explaining the complex topic of 
academic performance. More studies are needed in order to better understand the 
role played by emotional intelligence, as well as differences between different 
degrees or areas of study.

As recent meta-analyses confirmed that emotional intelligence (EI), particularly 
strategic EI, adjoins intelligence and personality in predicting academic 
achievement, we explored possible arrangements in which these predictors affect 
the given outcome in adolescents. Three models, with versions including either 
overall strategic EI or its branches, were considered: (a) a mediation model, 
whereby strategic EI partially mediates the effects of verbal intelligence (VI) 
and personality on achievement; the branch-level version assumed that emotion 
understanding affects achievement in a cascade via emotion management; (b) a 
direct effects model, with strategic EI/branches placed alongside VI and 
personality as another independent predictor of achievement; and (c) a 
moderation model, whereby personality moderates the effects of VI and strategic 
EI/branches on achievement. We tested these models in a sample of 227 students 
(M = 16.50 years) and found that both the mediation and the direct effects model 
with overall strategic EI fit the data; there was no support for a cascade 
within strategic EI, nor for the assumption that personality merely moderates 
the effects of abilities on achievement. Principally, strategic EI both mediated 
the effects of VI and openness, and independently predicted academic

The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in significant 
delays and cost overrun in construction projects. The implementation of health 
and safety (H&S) technologies is one of the most important strategies to 
alleviate the adverse impacts of COVID-19 on the construction industry and help 
the industry adapt to the new normal. This study aims to evaluate the adoption 
of H&S technologies for pandemic management in the construction sector under the 
COVID-19 pandemic. Semi-structured interviews with eighteen practitioners 
engaged from construction companies and technology firms were conducted to 
collect their views on the driving forces and issues of the adoption of H&S 
technologies for pandemic management in Chinese construction projects. The 
results reveal that the major H&S technologies used included the health quick 
response (QR) code system, artificial intelligence (AI)-powered fever 
monitoring, and site access control system. These technologies were reported to 
be effective in preventing the spread of the pandemic in workplaces. The 
findings of the study amplify that the pandemic may serve as an acceleration of 
the adoption of H&S technologies in the construction sector. Other technologies, 
such as building information modeling, drones, AI-based safety monitoring, and 
robotics, however, were seldom used in the studied projects. The interviewees 
addressed several problems regarding the implementation of these technologies. 
High costs of technologies, a lack of client support, and disruptions to the 
normal work process were the main hurdles of the adoption of these technologies. 
The results indicated that the external influence factor-the COVID-19 
pandemic-could considerably drive the use of H&S technologies, whereas the 
internal influence factors-cost and compatibility of technology-might be the 
major barriers to technology adoption. To encourage the wider use of H&S 
technologies in construction, the government is recommended to support the 
technology transformation by granting financial subsidies for costs involved in 
innovation adoption. Project owners may consider investing substantially in H&S 
technologies that can strengthen their resilient and innovative ability to adapt 
to the post-COVID-19 landscape. The present results will be useful to industry 
stakeholders and researchers interested in developing H&S technologies for 
combating the COVID-19 pandemic and future crises.

Studies investigating the association of vitamin D on intelligence is limited. 
The present study therefore aims to determine the association of vitamin D 
status with the different domains of intelligence among Saudi Arabian 
adolescents. This study used relational survey method among 1864 Saudi 
adolescent, including 549 boys and 1315 girls (mean age 14.7 ± 1.7 years) 
recruited using a multistage, stratified cluster randomization of 47 public and 
private schools in Riyadh in Saudi Arabia. A general questionnaire was used to 
collect demographic information. Intelligence was assessed using multiple 
intelligence inventory. Anthropometrics were measured and fasting blood samples 
collected for assessment of glucose and lipid profile. Vitamin D deficiency 
(25(OH)D <50 nmol/L) was observed in 84.2% of boys and 93.5% of girls. Girls had 
higher levels of verbal, kinesthetic, musical, naturalist and existential 
intelligence than boys, while boys have higher logical intelligence than girls 
(p-values < 0.05). Mixed regression analysis controlled for age, BMI and sex 
revealed that kinesthetic intelligence was significantly associated with 25(OH)D 
in boys (β 5.6 (2.8-8.5; p < 0.001)) and inversely associated with musical 
intelligence (β -1.2 (-2.3-0.1; p = 0.03)) and positively with naturalist (β 2.3 
(0.5-4.2; p = 0.01)) in girls. Vitamin D status is associated with several 
domains of intelligence in adolescents and is sex-specific. Development a 
specific domain of intelligence may indirectly affect vitamin D status among 
adolescents, but needs to be proven prospectively.

In order to have an accurate and fast prediction of the artificial intelligence 
(AI) model, the choice of input features is at least as important as the choice 
of model. The effect of input features selection on the emission models of light 
diesel vehicles driven on real roads was investigated in this paper. The 
gradient boosting regression (GBR) model was used to train and to predict the 
emissions of nitrogen oxide (NOx), carbon dioxide (CO2), and the fuel 
consumption of real driving diesel vehicles in urban scenarios, the suburbs, and 
on highways. A portable emissions measurement system (PEMS) system was used to 
collect data of vehicles as well as environmental conditions. The vehicle was 
run on two routes. The model was trained with the first route data and was used 
to predict the emissions of the second route. There were ten features related to 
the NOx model and nine features associated with the CO2 model. The importance of 
each feature was sorted, and a different number of features were used as input 
to train the models. The best NOx model had the coefficient of determination 
(R2) values of 0.99, 0.99, and 0.99 in each driving pattern (urban, suburbs, and 
highways). Predictions of the second route had the R2 values of 0.88, 0.89, and 
0.96 respectively. The best CO2 model had the R2 values of 0.98, 0.99, and 0.99 
in each driving pattern, respectively. Predictions of the second route had the 
R2 values are 0.79, 0.82, and 0.83, respectively. The most important features 
for the NOx model are mass air flow rate (g/s), exhaust flow rate (m3/min), and 
CO2 (ppm), while the important features for the CO2 model are exhaust flow rate 
(m3/min) and mass air flow rate (g/s). It is noted that the regression models 
based on the top three features may give predictions very close to the measured 
data.

New Insights on the Mediating Role of Emotional Intelligence and Social Support 
on University Students' Mental Health during COVID-19 Pandemic: Gender Matters.

Porto, Portugal.

Due to the demanding changes caused in the population by the COVID-19 pandemic, 
including a persisting experience of fear and social isolation, multiple studies 
have focused on the protective role of several psychological characteristics on 
mental health. Emotional intelligence and social support are commonly linked to 
mental health and well-being. The present study aims to analyze the mediator 
role of emotional intelligence and social support on university students' mental 
health, taking into consideration the role of gender differences. An online 
questionnaire was administered to a sample of 923 university students during the 
COVID-19 lockdown in Portugal. Significant gender differences were found on 
mental health symptoms, emotional intelligence, and social support. A double 
mediation model was computed to verify if gender influences on mental health 
were mediated by emotional intelligence and social support. The results show 
indirect effects of gender on mental health. However, as both mediators mediate 
in the opposite direction, the total indirect effects become null. Thus, a 
strong direct effect of gender on mental health remains. The results of the 
present study have theoretical implications on protective factors of mental 
health by gender and practical implications for psychological intervention in 
university counselling services.

The Effects of Lifestyle on the Risk of Lyme Disease in the United States: 
Evaluation of Market Segmentation Systems in Prevention and Control Strategies.

Sciences, University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152, USA.

39762, USA.

The aim of this study was to investigate lifestyles at risk of Lyme disease, and 
to geographically identify target populations/households at risk based on their 
lifestyle preferences. When coupled with geographically identified patient 
health information (e.g., incidence, diagnostics), lifestyle data provide a more 
solid base of information for directing public health objectives in minimizing 
the risk of Lyme disease and targeting populations with Lyme-disease-associated 
lifestyles. We used an ESRI Tapestry segmentation system that classifies U.S. 
neighborhoods into 67 unique segments based on their demographic and 
socioeconomic characteristics. These 67 segments are grouped within 14 larger 
"LifeModes" that have commonalities based on lifestyle and life stage. Our 
dataset contains variables denoting the dominant Tapestry segments within each 
U.S. county, along with annual Lyme disease incidence rates from 2000 through 
2017, and the average incidence over these 18 years. K-means clustering was used 
to cluster counties based on yearly incidence rates for the years 2000-2017. We 
used analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistical testing to determine the 
association between Lyme disease incidence and LifeModes. We further determined 
that the LifeModes Affluent Estates, Upscale Avenues, GenXurban, and Cozy 
Country Living were associated with higher Lyme disease risk based on the 
results of analysis of means (ANOM) and Tukey's post hoc test, indicating that 
one of these LifeModes is the LifeMode with the greatest Lyme disease incidence 
rate. We further conducted trait analysis of the high-risk LifeModes to see 
which traits were related to higher Lyme disease incidence. Due to the extreme 
regional nature of Lyme disease incidence, we carried out our national-level 
analysis at the regional level. Significant differences were detected in 
incidence rates and LifeModes in individual regions. We mapped Lyme disease 
incidence with associated LifeModes in the Northeast, Southeast, Midcontinent, 
Rocky Mountain, and Southwest regions to reflect the location-dependent nature 
of the relationship between lifestyle and Lyme disease.

Impacts of Fluoride Neurotoxicity and Mitochondrial Dysfunction on Cognition and 
Mental Health: A Literature Review.

Adkins EA(1), Brunst KJ(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Environmental and Public Health Sciences, University of 
Cincinnati College of Medicine, 160 Panzeca Way, Cincinnati, OH 45226, USA.

This review focuses on the synthesis of current experimental and observational 
data regarding the effect of fluoride exposure on childhood mental health and 
the role of mitochondrial function as a mechanism of action. We aggregated data 
on the relationships between fluoride neurotoxicity, mitochondrial function, and 
cognitive and mental health using PubMed. Current animal and human research 
suggest that prenatal and perinatal fluoride exposure might have neurotoxic 
effects. These studies observed physical changes (fur loss and delayed reflex 
development in animals), intelligence loss, increased hyperactivity, and 
irregular moods associated with fluoride exposure. Two gaps in the literature 
were identified: (1) there is limited research on the mental and emotional 
impacts of fluoride exposure compared to research on cognitive outcomes, and (2) 
human studies primarily focus on prenatal and perinatal exposure, with little 
research conducted at other time points (e.g., adolescence). Furthermore, there 
is no agreed-upon mechanism for the neurotoxic effects of fluoride; however, 
fluoride can induce mitochondrial damage, including decreasing circulating 
mitochondrial DNA content, dysregulating biogenesis, and circular structure 
loss. Additionally, many neurodevelopmental conditions have mitochondrial 
underpinnings. More work is needed to elucidate the impact and timing of 
fluoride exposure on mental health and the role of mitochondrial function as a 
biological mechanism.

Computational approaches including machine learning, deep learning, and 
artificial intelligence are growing in importance in all medical specialties as 
large data repositories are increasingly being optimised. Radiation oncology as 
a discipline is at the forefront of large-scale data acquisition and well 
positioned towards both the production and analysis of large-scale oncologic 
data with the potential for clinically driven endpoints and advancement of 
patient outcomes. Neuro-oncology is comprised of malignancies that often carry 
poor prognosis and significant neurological sequelae. The analysis of radiation 
therapy mediated treatment and the potential for computationally mediated 
analyses may lead to more precise therapy by employing large scale data. We 
analysed the state of the literature pertaining to large scale data, 
computational analysis, and the advancement of molecular biomarkers in 
neuro-oncology with emphasis on radiation oncology. We aimed to connect existing 
and evolving approaches to realistic avenues for clinical implementation 
focusing on low grade gliomas (LGG), high grade gliomas (HGG), management of the 
elderly patient with HGG, rare central nervous system tumors, craniospinal 
irradiation, and re-irradiation to examine how computational analysis and 
molecular science may synergistically drive advances in personalised radiation 
therapy (RT) and optimise patient outcomes.

Developing new, more effective antibiotics against resistant Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis that inhibit its essential proteins is an appealing strategy for 
combating the global tuberculosis (TB) epidemic. Finding a compound that can 
target a particular cavity in a protein and interrupt its enzymatic activity is 
the crucial objective of drug design and discovery. Such a compound is then 
subjected to different tests, including clinical trials, to study its 
effectiveness against the pathogen in the host. In recent times, new techniques, 
which involve computational and analytical methods, enhanced the chances of drug 
development, as opposed to traditional drug design methods, which are laborious 
and time-consuming. The computational techniques in drug design have been 
improved with a new generation of software used to develop and optimize active 
compounds that can be used in future chemotherapeutic development to combat 
global tuberculosis resistance. This review provides an overview of the 
evolution of tuberculosis resistance, existing drug management, and the design 
of new anti-tuberculosis drugs developed based on the contributions of 
computational techniques. Also, we show an appraisal of available software and 
databases on computational drug design with an insight into the application of 
this software and databases in the development of anti-tubercular drugs. The 
review features a perspective involving machine learning, artificial 
intelligence, quantum computing, and CRISPR combination with available 
computational techniques as a prospective pathway to design new anti-tubercular 
drugs to combat resistant tuberculosis.

OBJECTIVES: In this study, based on the known vestibulo-hippocampal connections, 
we asked whether mild chronic vestibulopathy leads only to vestibular-related 
deficits or whether there are effects on hippocampal function, structure, and 
cognition in general. In more detail, we assessed whether chronic vestibulopathy 
leads to (a) deficits in vestibular tasks without cognitive demand (balancing), 
(b) deficits in spatial cognitive tasks that require vestibular input (path 
integration, rotational memory), (c) deficits in spatial cognitive tasks that do 
not rely on vestibular input, (d) deficits in general cognitive function, and 
(e) atrophy in the brain.
METHODS: A total of 15 patients with chronic uni- or bilateral vestibulopathy 
(56.8 ± 10.1 years; 4 females) were included in this study and were age- and 
gender-matched by the control participants (57.6 ± 10.5) in a pairwise manner. 
Given their clinical symptoms and their deficits of the vestibulo-ocular reflex 
(VOR) the patients could be classified as being mildly affected. All 
participants of the underwent the following tests: clinical balance (CBT), 
triangle completion (TCT) for path integration, rotational memory (RM), the 
visuo-spatial subset of the Berlin intelligence structure test (BIS-4) and d2-R 
for attention and concentration, and a structural MRI for gray matter analysis 
using voxel-based morphometry (VBM).
RESULTS: Compared to the healthy controls, the vestibulopathy patients performed 
significantly worse in terms of CBT, TCT, and RM but showed no differences in 
terms of the BIS-4 and d2-R. There were also no significant volumetric gray 
matter differences between the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that both non-cognitive and cognitive 
functions that rely on vestibular input (balancing, path integration, rotational 
memory) are impaired, even in mild chronic vestibulopathy, while other cognitive 
functions, which rely on visual input (visuo-spatial memory, attention), are 
unimpaired in this condition, together with an overall intact brain structure. 
These findings may reflect a segregation between vestibular- and 
visual-dependent processes in the medial temporal lobe on the one hand and a 
structure-function dissociation on the other.

Innovative development in the energy and chemical industries is mainly dependent 
on advances in the accelerated design and development of new functional 
materials. The success of research in new nanocatalysts mainly relies on modern 
techniques and approaches for their precise characterization. The existing 
methods of experimental characterization of nanocatalysts, which make it 
possible to assess the possibility of using these materials in specific chemical 
reactions or applications, generate significant amounts of heterogeneous data. 
The acceleration of new functional materials, including nanocatalysts, directly 
depends on the speed and quality of extracting hidden dependencies and knowledge 
from the obtained experimental data. Usually, such experiments involve different 
characterization techniques and different types of X-ray absorption spectroscopy 
(XAS) too. Using the machine learning (ML) methods based on XAS data, we can 
study and predict the atomic-scale structure and another bunch of parameters for 
the nanocatalyst efficiently. However, before using any ML model, it is 
necessary to make sure that the XAS raw experimental data is properly 
pre-processed, cleared, and prepared for ML application. Usually, the XAS 
preprocessing stage is vaguely presented in scientific studies, and the main 
efforts of researchers are devoted to the ML description and implementation 
stage. However, the quality of the input data influences the quality of ML 
analysis and the prediction results used in the future. This paper fills the gap 
between the stage of obtaining XAS data from synchrotron facilities and the 
stage of using and customizing various ML analysis and prediction models. We 
aimed this study to develop automated tools for the preprocessing and 
presentation of data from physical experiments and the creation of deposited 
datasets on the basis of the example of studying palladium-based nanocatalysts 
using synchrotron radiation facilities. During the study, methods of preliminary 
processing of XAS data were considered, which can be conditionally divided into 
X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine 
structure (EXAFS). This paper proposes a software toolkit that implements data 
preprocessing scenarios in the form of a single pipeline. The main preprocessing 
methods used in this study proposed are principal component analysis (PCA); 
z-score normalization; the interquartile method for eliminating outliers in the 
data; as well as the k-means machine learning method, which makes it possible to 
clarify the phase of the studied material sample by clustering feature vectors 
of experiments. Among the results of this study, one should also highlight the 
obtained deposited datasets of physical experiments on palladium-based 
nanocatalysts using synchrotron radiation. This will allow for further 
high-quality data mining to extract new knowledge about materials using 
artificial intelligence methods and machine learning models, and will ensure the 
smooth dissemination of these datasets to researchers and their reuse.

Silica fume (SF) is a mineral additive that is widely used in the construction 
industry when producing sustainable concrete. The integration of SF in concrete 
as a partial replacement for cement has several evident benefits, including 
reduced CO2 emissions, cost-effective concrete, increased durability, and 
mechanical qualities. As environmental issues continue to grow, the development 
of predictive machine learning models is critical. Thus, this study aims to 
create modelling tools for estimating the compressive and cracking tensile 
strengths of silica fume concrete. Multilayer perceptron neural networks 
(MLPNN), adaptive neural fuzzy detection systems (ANFIS), and genetic 
programming are all used (GEP). From accessible literature data, a broad and 
accurate database of 283 compressive strengths and 149 split tensile strengths 
was created. The six most significant input parameters were cement, fine 
aggregate, coarse aggregate, water, superplasticizer, and silica fume. Different 
statistical measures were used to evaluate models, including mean absolute 
error, root mean square error, root mean squared log error and the coefficient 
of determination. Both machine learning models, MLPNN and ANFIS, produced 
acceptable results with high prediction accuracy. Statistical analysis revealed 
that the ANFIS model outperformed the MLPNN model in terms of compressive and 
tensile strength prediction. The GEP models outperformed all other models. The 
predicted values for compressive strength and splitting tensile strength for GEP 
models were consistent with experimental values, with an R2 value of 0.97 for 
compressive strength and 0.93 for splitting tensile strength. Furthermore, 
sensitivity tests revealed that cement and water are the determining parameters 
in the growth of compressive strength but have the least effect on splitting 
tensile strength. Cross-validation was used to avoid overfitting and to confirm 
the output of the generalized modelling technique. GEP develops an empirical 
expression for each outcome to forecast future databases' features to promote 
the usage of green concrete.

The precise identification of micro-features on 2.25Cr1Mo0.25V steel is of great 
significance for understanding the mechanism of hydrogen embrittlement (HE) and 
evaluating the alloy's properties of HE resistance. Presently, the convolution 
neural network (CNN) of deep learning is widely applied in the micro-features 
identification of alloy. However, with the development of the transformer in 
image recognition, the transformer-based neural network performs better on the 
learning of global and long-range semantic information than CNN and achieves 
higher prediction accuracy. In this work, a new transformer-based neural network 
model Swin-UNet++ was proposed. Specifically, the architecture of the decoder 
was redesigned to more precisely detect and identify the micro-feature with 
complex morphology (i.e., dimples) of 2.25Cr1Mo0.25V steel fracture surface. 
Swin-UNet++ and other segmentation models performed state-of-the-art (SOTA) were 
compared on the dimple dataset constructed in this work, which consists of 830 
dimple scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images on 2.25Cr1Mo0.25V steel 
fracture surface. The segmentation results show Swin-UNet++ not only realizes 
the accurate identification of dimples but displays a much higher prediction 
accuracy and stronger robustness than Swin-Unet and UNet. Moreover, efforts from 
this work will also provide an important reference value to the identification 
of other micro-features with complex morphologies.

Emotional intelligence (EI) refers to the ability to perceive, express, 
understand, and manage emotions. Current research indicates that it may protect 
against the emotional burden experienced in certain professions. This article 
aims to provide an updated systematic review of existing instruments to assess 
EI in professionals, focusing on the description of their characteristics as 
well as their psychometric properties (reliability and validity). A literature 
search was conducted in Web of Science (WoS). A total of 2761 items met the 
eligibility criteria, from which a total of 40 different instruments were 
extracted and analysed. Most were based on three main models (i.e., skill-based, 
trait-based, and mixed), which differ in the way they conceptualize and measure 
EI. All have been shown to have advantages and disadvantages inherent to the 
type of tool. The instruments reported in the largest number of studies are 
Emotional Quotient Inventory (EQ-i), Schutte Self Report-Inventory (SSRI), 
Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test 2.0 (MSCEIT 2.0), Trait 
Meta-Mood Scale (TMMS), Wong and Law's Emotional Intelligence Scale (WLEIS), and 
Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire (TEIQue). The main measure of the 
estimated reliability has been internal consistency, and the construction of EI 
measures was predominantly based on linear modelling or classical test theory. 
The study has limitations: we only searched a single database, the impossibility 
of estimating inter-rater reliability, and non-compliance with some items 
required by PRISMA.

BACKGROUND: Treatment of malocclusion with clear removable appliances like 
Invisalign® or Spark™, require considerable higher level of patient compliance 
when compared to conventional fixed braces. The clinical outcomes and treatment 
efficiency strongly depend on the patient's discipline. Smart treatment coaching 
applications, like strojCHECK® are efficient for improving patient compliance.
PURPOSE: To evaluate the impact of computerized personalized decision algorithms 
responding to observed and anticipated patient behavior implemented as an update 
of an existing clinical orthodontic application (app).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Variables such as (1) patient app interaction, (2) 
patient app discipline and (3) clinical aligner tracking evaluated by artificial 
intelligence system (AI) system-Dental monitoring® were observed on the set of 
86 patients. Two 60-day periods were evaluated; before and after the app was 
updated with decision tree processes.
RESULTS: All variables showed significant improvement after the update except 
for the manifestation of clinical non-tracking in men, evaluated by artificial 
intelligence from video scans.
CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of application update including computerized 
decision processes can significantly enhance clinical performance of existing 
health care applications and improve patients' compliance. Using the algorithm 
with decision tree architecture could create a baseline for further machine 
learning optimization.

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the most common rheumatic disease of 
childhood and is characterized by an often insidious onset and a chronic 
relapsing-remitting course, once diagnosed. With successive flares of joint 
inflammation, joint damage accrues, often associated with pain and functional 
disability. The progressive nature and potential for chronic damage and 
disability caused by JIA emphasizes the critical need for a prompt and accurate 
diagnosis. This article provides a review of recent studies related to 
diagnosis, monitoring and management of JIA and outlines recent novel tools and 
techniques (infrared thermal imaging, three-dimensional imaging, accelerometry, 
artificial neural networks and fuzzy logic) which have demonstrated potential 
value in assessment and monitoring of JIA. The emergence of novel techniques to 
assist clinicians' assessments for diagnosis and monitoring of JIA has 
demonstrated promise; however, further research is required to confirm their 
clinical utility.

Background and Objectives: Device-assisted enteroscopy (DAE) allows deep 
exploration of the small bowel and combines diagnostic and therapeutic 
capacities. Suspected mid-gastrointestinal bleeding is the most frequent 
indication for DAE, and vascular lesions, particularly angioectasia, are the 
most common etiology. Nevertheless, the diagnostic yield of DAE for the 
detection of these lesions is suboptimal. Deep learning algorithms have shown 
great potential for automatic detection of lesions in endoscopy. We aimed to 
develop an artificial intelligence (AI) model for the automatic detection of 
angioectasia DAE images. Materials and Methods: A convolutional neural network 
(CNN) was developed using DAE images. Each frame was labeled as normal/mucosa or 
angioectasia. The image dataset was split for the constitution of training and 
validation datasets. The latter was used for assessing the performance of the 
CNN. Results: A total of 72 DAE exams were included, and 6740 images were 
extracted (5345 of normal mucosa and 1395 of angioectasia). The model had a 
sensitivity of 88.5%, a specificity of 97.1% and an AUC of 0.988. The image 
processing speed was 6.4 ms/frame. Conclusions: The application of AI to DAE may 
have a significant impact on the management of patients with suspected 
mid-gastrointestinal bleeding.

Regularization, Bayesian Inference, and Machine Learning Methods for Inverse 
Problems.

Classical methods for inverse problems are mainly based on regularization 
theory, in particular those, that are based on optimization of a criterion with 
two parts: a data-model matching and a regularization term. Different choices 
for these two terms and a great number of optimization algorithms have been 
proposed. When these two terms are distance or divergence measures, they can 
have a Bayesian Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) interpretation where these two terms 
correspond to the likelihood and prior-probability models, respectively. The 
Bayesian approach gives more flexibility in choosing these terms and, in 
particular, the prior term via hierarchical models and hidden variables. 
However, the Bayesian computations can become very heavy computationally. The 
machine learning (ML) methods such as classification, clustering, segmentation, 
and regression, based on neural networks (NN) and particularly convolutional NN, 
deep NN, physics-informed neural networks, etc. can become helpful to obtain 
approximate practical solutions to inverse problems. In this tutorial article, 
particular examples of image denoising, image restoration, and 
computed-tomography (CT) image reconstruction will illustrate this cooperation 
between ML and inversion.

Moth-flame optimization (MFO) algorithm inspired by the transverse orientation 
of moths toward the light source is an effective approach to solve global 
optimization problems. However, the MFO algorithm suffers from issues such as 
premature convergence, low population diversity, local optima entrapment, and 
imbalance between exploration and exploitation. In this study, therefore, an 
improved moth-flame optimization (I-MFO) algorithm is proposed to cope with 
canonical MFO's issues by locating trapped moths in local optimum via defining 
memory for each moth. The trapped moths tend to escape from the local optima by 
taking advantage of the adapted wandering around search (AWAS) strategy. The 
efficiency of the proposed I-MFO is evaluated by CEC 2018 benchmark functions 
and compared against other well-known metaheuristic algorithms. Moreover, the 
obtained results are statistically analyzed by the Friedman test on 30, 50, and 
100 dimensions. Finally, the ability of the I-MFO algorithm to find the best 
optimal solutions for mechanical engineering problems is evaluated with three 
problems from the latest test-suite CEC 2020. The experimental and statistical 
results demonstrate that the proposed I-MFO is significantly superior to the 
contender algorithms and it successfully upgrades the shortcomings of the 
canonical MFO.

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, 195 million people have been 
infected and 4.2 million have died from the disease or its side effects. 
Physicians, healthcare scientists and medical staff continuously try to deal 
with overloaded hospital admissions, while in parallel, they try to identify 
meaningful correlations between the severity of infected patients with their 
symptoms, comorbidities and biomarkers. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine 
learning (ML) have been used recently in many areas related to COVID-19 
healthcare. The main goal is to manage effectively the wide variety of issues 
related to COVID-19 and its consequences. The existing applications of ML to 
COVID-19 healthcare are based on supervised classifications which require a 
labeled training dataset, serving as reference point for learning, as well as 
predefined classes. However, the existing knowledge about COVID-19 and its 
consequences is still not solid and the points of common agreement among 
different scientific communities are still unclear. Therefore, this study aimed 
to follow an unsupervised clustering approach, where prior knowledge is not 
required (tabula rasa). More specifically, 268 hospitalized patients at the 
First Propaedeutic Department of Internal Medicine of AHEPA University Hospital 
of Thessaloniki were assessed in terms of 40 clinical variables (numerical and 
categorical), leading to a high-dimensionality dataset. Dimensionality reduction 
was performed by applying a principal component analysis (PCA) on the numerical 
part of the dataset and a multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) on the 
categorical part of the dataset. Then, the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) 
was applied to Gaussian mixture models (GMM) in order to identify the optimal 
number of clusters under which the best grouping of patients occurs. The 
proposed methodology identified four clusters of patients with similar clinical 
characteristics. The analysis revealed a cluster of asymptomatic patients that 
resulted in death at a rate of 23.8%. This striking result forces us to 
reconsider the relationship between the severity of COVID-19 clinical symptoms 
and the patient's mortality.

The study aims to create a preoperative model from baseline demographic and 
health-related quality of life scores (HRQOL) to predict a good to excellent 
early clinical outcome using a machine learning (ML) approach. A single spine 
surgery center retrospective review of prospectively collected data from January 
2016 to December 2020 from the institutional registry (SpineREG) was performed. 
The inclusion criteria were age ≥ 18 years, both sexes, lumbar arthrodesis 
procedure, a complete follow up assessment (Oswestry Disability Index-ODI, SF-36 
and COMI back) and the capability to read and understand the Italian language. A 
delta of improvement of the ODI higher than 12.7/100 was considered a "good 
early outcome". A combined target model of ODI (Δ ≥ 12.7/100), SF-36 PCS (Δ ≥ 
6/100) and COMI back (Δ ≥ 2.2/10) was considered an "excellent early outcome". 
The performance of the ML models was evaluated in terms of sensitivity, i.e., 
True Positive Rate (TPR), specificity, i.e., True Negative Rate (TNR), accuracy 
and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC ROC). A total of 
1243 patients were included in this study. The model for predicting ODI at 6 
months' follow up showed a good balance between sensitivity (74.3%) and 
specificity (79.4%), while providing a good accuracy (75.8%) with ROC AUC = 
0.842. The combined target model showed a sensitivity of 74.2% and specificity 
of 71.8%, with an accuracy of 72.8%, and an ROC AUC = 0.808. The results of our 
study suggest that a machine learning approach showed high performance in 
predicting early good to excellent clinical results.

Cardiovascular disease is a major complication of chronic kidney disease. The 
coronary artery calcium (CAC) score is a surrogate marker for the risk of 
coronary artery disease. The purpose of this study is to predict outcomes for 
non-dialysis chronic kidney disease patients under the age of 60 with high CAC 
scores using machine learning techniques. We developed the predictive models 
with a chronic kidney disease representative cohort, the Korean Cohort Study for 
Outcomes in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (KNOW-CKD). We divided the 
cohort into a training dataset (70%) and a validation dataset (30%). The test 
dataset incorporated an external dataset of patients that were not included in 
the KNOW-CKD cohort. Support vector machine, random forest, XGboost, logistic 
regression, and multi-perceptron neural network models were used in the 
predictive models. We evaluated the model's performance using the area under the 
receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve. Shapley additive explanation 
values were applied to select the important features. The random forest model 
showed the best predictive performance (AUROC 0.87) and there was a 
statistically significant difference between the traditional logistic regression 
model and the test dataset. This study will help identify patients at high risk 
of cardiovascular complications in young chronic kidney disease and establish 
individualized treatment strategies.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) manifests heterogeneously among persons suffering from 
it, making its disease course highly challenging to predict. At present, 
prognosis mostly relies on biomarkers that are unable to predict disease course 
on an individual level. Machine learning is a promising technique, both in terms 
of its ability to combine multimodal data and through the capability of making 
personalized predictions. However, most investigations on machine learning for 
prognosis in MS were geared towards predicting physical deterioration, while 
cognitive deterioration, although prevalent and burdensome, remained largely 
overlooked. This review aims to boost the field of machine learning for 
cognitive prognosis in MS by means of an introduction to machine learning and 
its pitfalls, an overview of important elements for study design, and an 
overview of the current literature on cognitive prognosis in MS using machine 
learning. Furthermore, the review discusses new trends in the field of machine 
learning that might be adopted for future studies in the field.

Consultation prioritization is fundamental in optimal healthcare management and 
its performance can be helped by artificial intelligence (AI)-dedicated software 
and by digital medicine in general. The need for remote consultation has been 
demonstrated not only in the pandemic-induced lock-down but also in rurality 
conditions for which access to health centers is constantly limited. The term 
"AI" indicates the use of a computer to simulate human intellectual behavior 
with minimal human intervention. AI is based on a "machine learning" process or 
on an artificial neural network. AI provides accurate diagnostic algorithms and 
personalized treatments in many fields, including oncology, ophthalmology, 
traumatology, and dermatology. AI can help vascular specialists in diagnostics 
of peripheral artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, and deep vein thrombosis 
by analyzing contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging or ultrasound data and 
in diagnostics of pulmonary embolism on multi-slice computed angiograms. 
Automatic methods based on AI may be applied to detect the presence and 
determine the clinical class of chronic venous disease. Nevertheless, data on 
using AI in this field are still scarce. In this narrative review, the authors 
discuss available data on AI implementation in arterial and venous disease 
diagnostics and care.

AIMS: We tested the hypothesis that artificial intelligence (AI)-powered 
algorithms applied to cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images could be able to 
detect the potential patterns of cardiac amyloidosis (CA). Readers in CMR 
centers with a low volume of referrals for the detection of myocardial storage 
diseases or a low volume of CMRs, in general, may overlook CA. In light of the 
growing prevalence of the disease and emerging therapeutic options, there is an 
urgent need to avoid misdiagnoses.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Using CMR data from 502 patients (CA: n = 82), we trained 
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automatically diagnose patients with CA. 
We compared the diagnostic accuracy of different state-of-the-art deep learning 
techniques on common CMR imaging protocols in detecting imaging patterns 
associated with CA. As a result of a 10-fold cross-validated evaluation, the 
best-performing fine-tuned CNN achieved an average ROC AUC score of 0.96, 
resulting in a diagnostic accuracy of 94% sensitivity and 90% specificity.
CONCLUSIONS: Applying AI to CMR to diagnose CA may set a remarkable milestone in 
an attempt to establish a fully computational diagnostic path for the diagnosis 
of CA, in order to support the complex diagnostic work-up requiring a profound 
knowledge of experts from different disciplines.

Fruits provide various vitamins to the human body. The chemical properties of 
fruits provide useful information to researchers, including determining the 
ripening time of fruits and the lack of nutrients in them. Conventional methods 
for determining the chemical properties of fruits are destructive and 
time-consuming methods that have no application for online operations. For that, 
various researchers have conducted various studies on non-destructive methods, 
which are currently in the research and development stage. Thus, the present 
paper focusses on a non-destructive method based on spectral data in the 
200-1100-nm region for estimation of total soluble solids and BrimA in Gala 
apples. The work steps included: (1) collecting different samples of Gala apples 
at different stages of maturity; (2) extracting spectral data of samples and 
pre-preprocessing them; (3) measuring the chemical properties of TSS and BrimA; 
(4) selecting optimal (effective) wavelengths using artificial neural 
network-simulated annealing algorithm (ANN-SA); and (5) estimating chemical 
properties based on partial least squares regression (PLSR) and hybrid 
artificial neural network known as the imperialist competitive algorithm 
(ANN-ICA). It should be noted that, in order to investigate the validity of the 
methods, the estimation algorithm was repeated 500 times. In the end, the 
results displayed that, in the best training, the ANN-ICA predicted the TSS and 
BrimA with correlation coefficients of 0.963 and 0.965 and root mean squared 
error of 0.167% and 0.596%, respectively.

Early Diagnosis and Real-Time Monitoring of Regional Lung Function Changes to 
Prevent Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Progression to Severe Emphysema.

First- and second-hand exposure to smoke or air pollutants is the primary cause 
of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) pathogenesis, where genetic and 
age-related factors predispose the subject to the initiation and progression of 
obstructive lung disease. Briefly, airway inflammation, specifically bronchitis, 
initiates the lung disease, leading to difficulty in breathing (dyspnea) and 
coughing as initial symptoms, followed by air trapping and inhibition of the 
flow of air into the lungs due to damage to the alveoli (emphysema). In 
addition, mucus obstruction and impaired lung clearance mechanisms lead to 
recurring acute exacerbations causing progressive decline in lung function, 
eventually requiring lung transplant and other lifesaving interventions to 
prevent mortality. It is noteworthy that COPD is much more common in the 
population than currently diagnosed, as only 16 million adult Americans were 
reported to be diagnosed with COPD as of 2018, although an additional 14 million 
American adults were estimated to be suffering from COPD but undiagnosed by the 
current standard of care (SOC) diagnostic, namely the spirometry-based pulmonary 
function test (PFT). Thus, the main issue driving the adverse disease outcome 
and significant mortality for COPD is lack of timely diagnosis in the early 
stages of the disease. The current treatment regime for COPD emphysema is most 
effective when implemented early, on COPD onset, where alleviating symptoms and 
exacerbations with timely intervention(s) can prevent steep lung function 
decline(s) and disease progression to severe emphysema. Therefore, the key to 
efficiently combatting COPD relies on early detection. Thus, it is important to 
detect early regional pulmonary function and structural changes to monitor 
modest disease progression for implementing timely interventions and effectively 
eliminating emphysema progression. Currently, COPD diagnosis involves using 
techniques such as COPD screening questionnaires, PFT, arterial blood gas 
analysis, and/or lung imaging, but these modalities are limited in their 
capability for early diagnosis and real-time disease monitoring of regional lung 
function changes. Hence, promising emerging techniques, such as X-ray phase 
contrast, photoacoustic tomography, ultrasound computed tomography, electrical 
impedance tomography, the forced oscillation technique, and the impulse 
oscillometry system powered by robust artificial intelligence and machine 
learning analysis capability are emerging as novel solutions for early detection 
and real time monitoring of COPD progression for timely intervention. We discuss 
here the scope, risks, and limitations of current SOC and emerging COPD 
diagnostics, with perspective on novel diagnostics providing real time regional 
lung function monitoring, and predicting exacerbation and/or disease onset for 
prognosis-based timely intervention(s) to limit COPD-emphysema progression.

Objectives: To determine the effectiveness of computer-assisted cognitive 
rehabilitation and compare the patterns of cognitive function recovery occurring 
in both traumatic brain injury (TBI) and stroke. Methods: A total of 62 patients 
were finally enrolled, consisting of 30 with TBI and 32 with stroke. The 
patients received 30 sessions of computer-assisted cognitive rehabilitation 
(Comcog) five times per week. Each session lasted for 30 min. Before and 
immediately after cognitive rehabilitation, all patients were evaluated by 
computerized neuropsychological test (CNT), Mini-Mental State Examination 
(MMSE), and modified Barthel index (MBI). Results: We analyzed the differences 
between pre- and post-cognitive rehabilitation in each TBI and stroke group. 
Significant differences were observed in MMSE, MBI, and some CNT contents, 
including digit span forward, verbal learning, verbal learning delayed recall, 
visual span forward, visual span backward, visual learning, trail making test A 
and B, and intelligence quotient (IQ) in the TBI group (p < 0.05). In the stroke 
group, in addition to significant differences that appeared in the TBI group, 
additional significant differences in the digit span backward, visual learning 
delayed recall, auditory continuous performance test (CPT), visual CPT, and card 
sorting test. We compared the difference values at pre- and post-cognitive 
rehabilitation for cognitive recovery between the TBI and stroke groups. All 
contents, except the digital span forward, visual learning, word-color test, and 
MMSE, had greater mean values in the stroke group; and thus, statistically 
significant higher values were observed in the visual span forward and card 
sorting test (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Most evaluation results showed improvement 
and the evaluation between the TBI and stroke groups also showed significant 
differences in cognitive functions in addition to more CNT contents, which 
significantly change in the stroke group. The stroke group showed a high 
difference value in most CNT contents. Therefore, those with stroke in the focal 
brain region tend to have better cognitive function recovery after a 
computer-assisted cognitive rehabilitation than those with TBI, which could 
cause diffuse brain damage and post-injury inflammation.

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is one of the most frequent subtypes of 
non-Hodgkin lymphomas. We used artificial neural networks (multilayer perceptron 
and radial basis function), machine learning, and conventional bioinformatics to 
predict the overall survival and molecular subtypes of DLBCL. The series 
included 106 cases and 730 genes of a pancancer immune-oncology panel (nCounter) 
as predictors. The multilayer perceptron predicted the outcome with high 
accuracy, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.98, and ranked all the genes 
according to their importance. In a multivariate analysis, ARG1, TNFSF12, REL, 
and NRP1 correlated with favorable survival (hazard risks: 0.3-0.5), and IFNA8, 
CASP1, and CTSG, with poor survival (hazard risks = 1.0-2.1). Gene set 
enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed enrichment toward poor prognosis. These 
high-risk genes were also associated with the gene expression of M2-like 
tumor-associated macrophages (CD163), and MYD88 expression. The prognostic 
relevance of this set of 7 genes was also confirmed within the IPI and MYC 
translocation strata, the EBER-negative cases, the DLBCL not-otherwise specified 
(NOS) (High-grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements 
excluded), and an independent series of 414 cases of DLBCL in Europe and North 
America (GSE10846). The perceptron analysis also predicted molecular subtypes 
(based on the Lymph2Cx assay) with high accuracy (AUC = 1). STAT6, TREM2, and 
REL were associated with the germinal center B-cell (GCB) subtype, and CD37, 
GNLY, CD46, and IL17B were associated with the activated B-cell 
(ABC)/unspecified subtype. The GSEA had a sinusoidal-like plot with association 
to both molecular subtypes, and immunohistochemistry analysis confirmed the 
correlation of MAPK3 with the GCB subtype in another series of 96 cases 
(notably, MAPK3 also correlated with LMO2, but not with M2-like tumor-associated 
macrophage markers CD163, CSF1R, TNFAIP8, CASP8, PD-L1, PTX3, and IL-10). 
Finally, survival and molecular subtypes were successfully modeled using other 
machine learning techniques including logistic regression, discriminant 
analysis, SVM, CHAID, C5, C&R trees, KNN algorithm, and Bayesian network. In 
conclusion, prognoses and molecular subtypes were predicted with high accuracy 
using neural networks, and relevant genes were highlighted.

OBJECTIVES: Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCRT) followed by surgery is the 
mainstay of treatment for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. Based on 
baseline 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]-FDG)-positron emission tomography 
(PET)/computed tomography (CT), a new artificial intelligence model using metric 
learning (ML) was introduced to predict responses to NCRT.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study used the data of 236 patients with newly 
diagnosed rectal cancer; the data of 202 and 34 patients were for training and 
validation, respectively. All patients received pretreatment [18F]FDG-PET/CT, 
NCRT, and surgery. The treatment response was scored by Dworak tumor regression 
grade (TRG); TRG3 and TRG4 indicated favorable responses. The model employed ML 
combined with the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for 
dimensionality reduction. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve 
analysis was performed to assess the model's predictive performance.
RESULTS: In the training cohort, 115 patients (57%) achieved TRG3 or TRG4 
responses. The area under the ROC curve was 0.96 for the prediction of a 
favorable response. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 98.3%, 
96.5%, and 97.5%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for 
the validation cohort were 95.0%, 100%, and 98.8%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The new ML model presented herein was used to determined that 
baseline 18F[FDG]-PET/CT images could predict a favorable response to NCRT in 
patients with rectal cancer. External validation is required to verify the 
model's predictive value.

Breast cancer (BC) is the leading cause of death among female patients with 
cancer. Patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) have the lowest 
survival rate. TNBC has substantial heterogeneity within the BC population. This 
study utilized our novel patient stratification and drug repositioning method to 
find subgroups of BC patients that share common genetic profiles and that may 
respond similarly to the recommended drugs. After further examination of the 
discovered patient subgroups, we identified five homogeneous druggable TNBC 
subgroups. A drug repositioning algorithm was then applied to find the drugs 
with a high potential for each subgroup. Most of the top drugs for these 
subgroups were chemotherapy used for various types of cancer, including BC. 
After analyzing the biological mechanisms targeted by these drugs, ferroptosis 
was the common cell death mechanism induced by the top drugs in the subgroups 
with neoplasm subdivision and race as clinical variables. In contrast, the 
antioxidative effect on cancer cells was the common targeted mechanism in the 
subgroup of patients with an age less than 50. Literature reviews were used to 
validate our findings, which could provide invaluable insights to streamline the 
drug repositioning process and could be further studied in a wet lab setting and 
in clinical trials.

Artificial intelligence makes surgical resection easier and safer, and, at the 
same time, can improve oncological results. The robotic system fits perfectly 
with these more or less diffused technologies, and it seems that this benefit is 
mutual. In liver surgery, robotic systems help surgeons to localize tumors and 
improve surgical results with well-defined preoperative planning or increased 
intraoperative detection. Furthermore, they can balance the absence of tactile 
feedback and help recognize intrahepatic biliary or vascular structures during 
parenchymal transection. Some of these systems are well known and are already 
widely diffused in open and laparoscopic hepatectomies, such as indocyanine 
green fluorescence or ultrasound-guided resections, whereas other tools, such as 
Augmented Reality, are far from being standardized because of the high 
complexity and elevated costs. In this paper, we review all the experiences in 
the literature on the use of artificial intelligence systems in robotic liver 
resections, describing all their practical applications and their weaknesses.

Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) caused by the human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV) continues to be a public health problem. In 2020, 680,000 people 
died from HIV-related causes, and 1.5 million people were infected. 
Antiretrovirals are a way to control HIV infection but not to cure AIDS. As 
such, effective treatment must be developed to control AIDS. Developing a drug 
is not an easy task, and there is an enormous amount of work and economic 
resources invested. For this reason, it is highly convenient to employ 
computer-aided drug design methods, which can help generate and identify novel 
molecules. Using the de novo design, novel molecules can be developed using 
fragments as building blocks. In this work, we develop a virtual focused 
compound library of HIV-1 viral protease inhibitors from natural product 
fragments. Natural products are characterized by a large diversity of functional 
groups, many sp3 atoms, and chiral centers. Pseudo-natural products are a 
combination of natural products fragments that keep the desired structural 
characteristics from different natural products. An interactive version of 
chemical space visualization of virtual compounds focused on HIV-1 viral 
protease inhibitors from natural product fragments is freely available in the 
supplementary material.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a new technology that has been employed to 
screen and discover new drugs. Using AI, an anti-diabetic treatment (Halicin) 
was nominated and proven to have a unique antibacterial activity against several 
harmful bacterial strains, including multidrug-resistant bacteria. This study 
aims to explore the antibacterial effect of halicin and microbial susceptibility 
using the zone of inhibition and the minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) 
values while assessing the stability of stored halicin over a period of time 
with cost-effective and straightforward methods. Linear regression graphs were 
constructed, and the correlation coefficient was calculated. The new 
antibacterial agent was able to inhibit all tested gram-positive and 
gram-negative bacterial strains, but in different concentrations-including the 
A. baumannii multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolate. The MIC of halicin was found to 
be 16 μg/mL for S. aureus (ATCC BAA-977), 32 μg/mL for E. coli (ATCC 25922), 128 
μg/mL for A. baumannii (ATCC BAA-747), and 256 μg/mL for MDR A. baumannii. Upon 
storage, the MICs were increased, suggesting instability of the drug after 
approximately a week of storage at 4 °C. MICs and zones of inhibition were found 
to be high (R = 0.90 to 0.98), suggesting that halicin has a promising 
antimicrobial activity and may be used as a wide-spectrum antibacterial drug. 
However, the drug's pharmacokinetics have not been investigated, and further 
elucidation is needed.

Several studies have shown that in recent years incidence of acute otitis media 
(AOM) has declined worldwide. However, related medical, social, and economic 
problems for patients, their families, and society remain very high. Better 
knowledge of potential risk factors for AOM development and more effective 
preventive interventions, particularly in AOM-prone children, can further reduce 
disease incidence. However, a more accurate AOM diagnosis seems essential to 
achieve this goal. Diagnostic uncertainty is common, and to avoid risks related 
to a disease caused mainly by bacteria, several children without AOM are treated 
with antibiotics and followed as true AOM cases. The main objective of this 
manuscript is to discuss the most common difficulties that presently limit 
accurate AOM diagnosis and the new approaches and technologies that have been 
proposed to improve disease detection. We showed that misdiagnosis can be 
dangerous or lead to relevant therapeutic mistakes. The need to improve AOM 
diagnosis has allowed the identification of a long list of technologies to 
visualize and evaluate the tympanic membrane and to assess middle-ear effusion. 
Most of the new instruments, including light field otoscopy, optical coherence 
tomography, low-coherence interferometry, and Raman spectroscopy, are far from 
being introduced in clinical practice. Video-otoscopy can be effective, 
especially when it is used in association with telemedicine, parents' 
cooperation, and artificial intelligence. Introduction of otologic telemedicine 
and use of artificial intelligence among pediatricians and ENT specialists must 
be strongly promoted in order to reduce mistakes in AOM diagnosis.

(1) Background: COVID-19 computed tomography (CT) lung segmentation is critical 
for COVID lung severity diagnosis. Earlier proposed approaches during 2020-2021 
were semiautomated or automated but not accurate, user-friendly, and 
industry-standard benchmarked. The proposed study compared the COVID Lung Image 
Analysis System, COVLIAS 1.0 (GBTI, Inc., and AtheroPointTM, Roseville, CA, USA, 
referred to as COVLIAS), against MedSeg, a web-based Artificial Intelligence 
(AI) segmentation tool, where COVLIAS uses hybrid deep learning (HDL) models for 
CT lung segmentation. (2) Materials and Methods: The proposed study used 5000 
ITALIAN COVID-19 positive CT lung images collected from 72 patients 
(experimental data) that confirmed the reverse transcription-polymerase chain 
reaction (RT-PCR) test. Two hybrid AI models from the COVLIAS system, namely, 
VGG-SegNet (HDL 1) and ResNet-SegNet (HDL 2), were used to segment the CT lungs. 
As part of the results, we compared both COVLIAS and MedSeg against two manual 
delineations (MD 1 and MD 2) using (i) Bland-Altman plots, (ii) Correlation 
coefficient (CC) plots, (iii) Receiver operating characteristic curve, and (iv) 
Figure of Merit and (v) visual overlays. A cohort of 500 CROATIA COVID-19 
positive CT lung images (validation data) was used. A previously trained COVLIAS 
model was directly applied to the validation data (as part of Unseen-AI) to 
segment the CT lungs and compare them against MedSeg. (3) Result: For the 
experimental data, the four CCs between COVLIAS (HDL 1) vs. MD 1, COVLIAS (HDL 
1) vs. MD 2, COVLIAS (HDL 2) vs. MD 1, and COVLIAS (HDL 2) vs. MD 2 were 0.96, 
0.96, 0.96, and 0.96, respectively. The mean value of the COVLIAS system for the 
above four readings was 0.96. CC between MedSeg vs. MD 1 and MedSeg vs. MD 2 was 
0.98 and 0.98, respectively. Both had a mean value of 0.98. On the validation 
data, the CC between COVLIAS (HDL 1) vs. MedSeg and COVLIAS (HDL 2) vs. MedSeg 
was 0.98 and 0.99, respectively. For the experimental data, the difference 
between the mean values for COVLIAS and MedSeg showed a difference of <2.5%, 
meeting the standard of equivalence. The average running times for COVLIAS and 
MedSeg on a single lung CT slice were ~4 s and ~10 s, respectively. (4) 
Conclusions: The performances of COVLIAS and MedSeg were similar. However, 
COVLIAS showed improved computing time over MedSeg.

Ganglion cysts are common soft tissue masses of the hand and wrist, and small 
size cysts are often hypoechoic. Thus, identifying them from ultrasonography is 
not an easy problem. In this paper, we propose an automatic segmentation method 
using two artificial intelligence algorithms in sequence. A density based 
unsupervised learning algorithm called DBSCAN is performed as a front-end and 
its result determines the number of clusters used in the Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) 
clustering algorithm for quantification of ganglion cyst object. In an 
experiment using 120 images, the proposed method shows a higher extraction rate 
(89.2%) and lower false positive rate compared with FCM when the ground truth is 
set as the human expert's decision. Such human-like behavior is more apparent 
when the size of the ganglion cyst is small that the quality of ultrasonography 
is often not very high. With this fully automatic segmentation method, the 
operator subjectivity that is highly dependent on the experience of the 
ultrasound examiner can be mitigated with high reliability.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the 1-year visual acuity predictive performance of an 
artificial intelligence (AI) based model applied to optical coherence tomography 
angiography (OCT-A) vascular layers scans from eyes with a full-thickness 
macular hole (FTMH).
METHODS: In this observational cross-sectional, single-center study, 35 eyes of 
35 patients with FTMH were analyzed by OCT-A before and 1-year after surgery. 
Superficial vascular plexus (SVP) and deep vascular plexus (DVP) images were 
collected for the analysis. AI approach based on convolutional neural networks 
(CNN) was used to generate a continuous predictive variable based on both SVP 
and DPV. Different pre-trained CNN networks were used for feature extraction and 
compared for predictive accuracy.
RESULTS: Among the different tested models, the inception V3 network, applied on 
the combination of deep and superficial OCT-A images, showed the most 
significant differences between the two obtained image clusters defined in C1 
and C2 (best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) C1 = 66.67 (16.00 SD) and BCVA C2 = 
49.10 (18.60 SD, p = 0.005)).
CONCLUSIONS: The AI-based analysis of preoperative OCT-A images of eyes affected 
by FTMH may be a useful support system in setting up visual acuity recovery 
prediction. The combination of preoperative SVP and DVP images showed a 
significant morphological predictive performance for visual acuity recovery.

Previous studies suggest an impact of body composition on outcome in melanoma 
patients. We aimed to determine the prognostic value of CT-based body 
composition assessment in patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy 
for treatment of metastatic disease using a deep learning approach. One hundred 
seven patients with staging CT examinations prior to initiation of checkpoint 
inhibition between January 2013 and August 2019 were retrospectively evaluated. 
Using an automated deep learning-based body composition analysis pipeline, 
parameters for estimation of skeletal muscle mass (skeletal muscle index, SMI) 
and adipose tissue compartments (visceral adipose tissue index, VAI; 
subcutaneous adipose tissue index, SAI) were derived from staging CT. The cohort 
was binarized according to gender-specific median cut-off values. Patients below 
the median were defined as having low SMI, VAI, or SAI, respectively. The impact 
on outcome was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method with log-rank tests. A 
multivariable logistic regression model was built to test the impact of body 
composition parameters on 3-year mortality. Patients with low SMI displayed 
significantly increased 1-year (25% versus 9%, p = 0.035), 2-year (32% versus 
13%, p = 0.017), and 3-year mortality (38% versus 19%, p = 0.016). No 
significant differences with regard to adipose tissue compartments were observed 
(3-year mortality: VAI, p = 0.448; SAI, p = 0.731). On multivariable analysis, 
low SMI (hazard ratio (HR), 2.245; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.005-5.017; p 
= 0.049), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (HR, 1.170; 95% CI, 1.076-1.273; p < 
0.001), and Karnofsky index (HR, 0.965; 95% CI, 0.945-0.985; p = 0.001) remained 
as significant predictors of 3-year mortality. Lowered skeletal muscle index as 
an indicator of sarcopenia was associated with worse outcome in patients with 
metastatic melanoma receiving immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in global disruptions within healthcare 
systems, leading to quick dynamic fluctuations in hospital operations and supply 
chain management. During the early months of the pandemic, tertiary 
multihospital systems were highly viewed as the go-to hospitals for handling 
these rapid healthcare challenges caused by the rapidly increasing number of 
COVID-19 cases. Yet, this pandemic has created an urgent need for coordinated 
mechanisms to alleviate increasing pressures on these large multihospital 
systems and ensure services remain high-quality, accessible, and sustainable. 
Digital health solutions have been identified as promising approaches to address 
these challenges. This case report describes results for developing 
multidisciplinary visualizations to support digital health operations in one of 
the largest tertiary multihospital systems in the Middle East. The report 
concludes with some lessons and insights learned from the rapid development and 
delivery of this user-centric COVID-19 multihospital operations intelligent 
platform.

BACKGROUND: High-quality colonoscopy is essential to prevent the occurrence of 
colorectal cancers. The data of colonoscopy are mainly stored in the form of 
images. Therefore, artificial intelligence-assisted colonoscopy based on medical 
images is not only a research hotspot, but also one of the effective auxiliary 
means to improve the detection rate of adenomas. This research has become the 
focus of medical institutions and scientific research departments and has 
important clinical and scientific research value.
METHODS: In this paper, we propose a YOLOv5 model based on a self-attention 
mechanism for polyp target detection. This method uses the idea of regression, 
using the entire image as the input of the network and directly returning the 
target frame of this position in multiple positions of the image. In the feature 
extraction process, an attention mechanism is added to enhance the contribution 
of information-rich feature channels and weaken the interference of useless 
channels; Results: The experimental results show that the method can accurately 
identify polyp images, especially for the small polyps and the polyps with 
inconspicuous contrasts, and the detection speed is greatly improved compared 
with the comparison algorithm.
CONCLUSIONS: This study will be of great help in reducing the missed diagnosis 
of clinicians during endoscopy and treatment, and it is also of great 
significance to the development of clinicians' clinical work.

BACKGROUND: The early detection of carotid wall plaque is recommended in the 
prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in moderate-risk patients. Previous 
techniques for B-mode carotid atherosclerotic wall plaque segmentation used 
artificial intelligence (AI) methods on monoethnic databases, where training and 
testing are from the "same" ethnic group ("Seen AI"). Therefore, the versatility 
of the system is questionable. This is the first study of its kind that uses the 
"Unseen AI" paradigm where training and testing are from "different" ethnic 
groups. We hypothesized that deep learning (DL) models should perform in 10% 
proximity between "Unseen AI" and "Seen AI".
METHODOLOGY: Two cohorts from multi-ethnic groups (330 Japanese and 300 Hong 
Kong (HK)) were used for the validation of our hypothesis. We used a 
four-layered UNet architecture for the segmentation of the atherosclerotic wall 
with low plaque. "Unseen AI" (training: Japanese, testing: HK or vice versa) and 
"Seen AI" experiments (single ethnicity or mixed ethnicity) were performed. 
Evaluation was conducted by measuring the wall plaque area. Statistical tests 
were conducted for its stability and reliability.
RESULTS: When using the UNet DL architecture, the "Unseen AI" pair one 
(Training: 330 Japanese and Testing: 300 HK), the mean accuracy, 
dice-similarity, and correlation-coefficient were 98.55, 78.38, and 0.80 (p < 
0.0001), respectively, while for "Unseen AI" pair two (Training: 300 HK and 
Testing: 330 Japanese), these were 98.67, 82.49, and 0.87 (p < 0.0001), 
respectively. Using "Seen AI", the same parameters were 99.01, 86.89 and 0.92 (p 
< 0.0001), respectively.
CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that "Unseen AI" was in close proximity (<10%) to 
"Seen AI", validating our DL model for low atherosclerotic wall plaque 
segmentation. The online system runs < 1 s.

The aim of this study was to determine the impact of oral health on adolescent 
quality of life and to compare the results obtained using standard statistical 
methods and artificial intelligence algorithms. In order to measure the impact 
of oral health on adolescent quality of life, a validated Serbian version of the 
Oral Impacts on Daily Performance (OIDP) scale was used. The total sample 
comprised 374 respondents. The obtained results were processed using standard 
statistical methods and machine learning, i.e., artificial intelligence 
algorithms-singular value decomposition. OIDP score was dichotomized into two 
categories depending on whether the respondents had or did not have oral or 
teeth problems affecting their life quality. Human intuition and machine 
algorithms came to the same conclusion on how the respondents should be divided. 
As such, method quality and the need to perform analyses of this type in 
dentistry studies were demonstrated. Using artificial intelligence algorithms, 
the respondents can be clustered into characteristic groups that allow the 
discovery of details not possible with the intuitive division of respondents by 
gender.

There is broad consensus on the need to foster oral skills in middle school due 
to their inherent importance and because they serve as a tool for learning and 
acquiring other competences. In order to facilitate the assessment of 
communicative competence, we hereby propose a model which establishes five key 
dimensions for effective oral communication: interaction management; 
multimodality and prosody; textual coherence and cohesion; argumentative 
strategies; and lexicon and terminology. Based on this model, we developed 
indicators to measure the proposed dimensions, thus generating a self-report 
tool to assess oral communication in middle school. Following an initial study 
conducted with 168 students (mean age = 12.47 years, SD = 0.41), we selected 22 
items with the highest discriminant power, while in a second study carried out 
with a sample of 960 students (mean age 14.11 years, SD = 0.97), we obtained 
evidence concerning factorial validity and the relationships between oral 
skills, emotional intelligence and metacognitive strategies related to 
metacomprehension. We concluded that the proposed model and its derived measure 
constitute an instrument with good psychometric properties for a reliable and 
valid assessment of students' oral competence in middle school.

Currently, several pathologies have corresponding and specific diagnostic and 
therapeutic branches of interest focused on early and correct detection, as well 
as the best therapeutic approach. Radiology never ceases to develop newer 
technologies in order to give patients a clear, safe, early, and precise 
diagnosis; furthermore, in the last few years diagnostic imaging panoramas have 
been extended to the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. 
On the other hand, clinical and laboratory tests, like flow cytometry and the 
techniques found in the "omics" sciences, aim to detect microscopic elements, 
like extracellular vesicles, with the highest specificity and sensibility for 
disease detection. If these scientific branches started to cooperate, playing a 
conjugated role in pathology diagnosis, what could be the results? Our review 
seeks to give a quick overview of recent state of the art research which 
investigates correlations between extracellular vesicles and the known 
radiological features useful for diagnosis.

The current study aimed to compare differences in the cognitive development of 
children with and without upper limb motor disorders. The study involved 89 
children from 3 to 15 years old; 57 children with similar upper limb motor 
disorders and 32 healthy children. Our results showed that motor disorders could 
impair cognitive functions, especially memory. In particular, we found that 
children between 8 and 11 years old with upper limb disorders differed 
significantly from their healthy peers in both auditory and visual memory 
scales. These results can be explained by the fact that the development of 
cognitive functions depends on the normal development of motor skills, and the 
developmental delay of motor skills affects cognitive functions. Correlation 
analysis did not reveal any significant relationship between other cognitive 
functions (attention, thinking, intelligence) and motor function. Altogether, 
these findings point to the need to adapt general habilitation programs for 
children with motor disorders, considering the cognitive impairment during their 
development. The evaluation of children with motor impairment is often limited 
to their motor dysfunction, leaving their cognitive development neglected. The 
current study showed the importance of cognitive issues for these children. 
Moreover, early intervention, particularly focused on memory, can prevent some 
of the accompanying difficulties in learning and daily life functioning of 
children with movement disorders.

Long-term studies indicated changes in aspects of cognition, psychopathology, 
and quality of life (QOL) in children and adolescents followed up after the 
diagnosis of epilepsy. However, evidence is limited regarding what happens 
during the first few months after epilepsy is diagnosed because at this phase is 
possible to adjust and/or change an AED regimen or add other treatment 
interventions, if needed. This is a naturalistic, six months follow-up study 
that evaluated changes in overall cognitive profiles, levels of 
psychopathological symptoms, and quality of life (QOL) in newly diagnosed, 
uncomplicated pediatric epilepsy. In total, 61 (35 [57.4%] males) children and 
adolescents aged 7-18 years were assessed at the time of diagnosis and the 
initiation of antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment and six months afterward. The 
Revised Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, the Revised Child Anxiety and 
Depression Scale (RCADS), Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form for typically 
developing children and adolescents (NCBRF), KIDSCREEN-10 Quality of Life 
Measure, and Adverse Event Profile (AEP) were used. The RCADS and NCBRF scores 
significantly increased over time, while the KIDSCREEN-10 scores significantly 
decreased. The most significant increases were observed in scores measuring 
social phobia and depressive symptoms and inattentiveness. Verbal cognitive 
abilities and full-scale intelligence scores changed slightly, while more 
changes were found in aspects of non-verbal cognitive abilities. This study 
showed that six months after epilepsy diagnosis and AED initiation, there were 
marked increases in anxiety levels, depressive symptoms, and behavioral 
problems, with deteriorations in QOL, while cognitive changes were relatively 
minimal. Therefore, monitoring levels of psychopathological symptoms and QOL in 
newly diagnosed epilepsy is highly recommended.

Beneficent dehumanization: Employing artificial intelligence and carebots to 
mitigate shame-induced barriers to medical care.

Washington.

As costs decline and technology inevitably improves, current trends suggest that 
artificial intelligence (AI) and a variety of "carebots" will increasingly be 
adopted in medical care. Medical ethicists have long expressed concerns that 
such technologies remove the human element from medicine, resulting in 
dehumanization and depersonalized care. However, we argue that where shame 
presents a barrier to medical care, it is sometimes ethically permissible and 
even desirable to deploy AI/carebots because (i) dehumanization in medicine is 
not always morally wrong, and (ii) dehumanization can sometimes better promote 
and protect important medical values. Shame is often a consequence of the 
human-to-human element of medical care and can prevent patients from seeking 
treatment and from disclosing important information to their healthcare 
provider. Conditions and treatments that are shame-inducing offer opportunities 
for introducing AI/carebots in a manner that removes the human element of 
medicine but does so ethically. We outline numerous examples of shame-inducing 
interactions and how they are overcome by implementing existing and expected 
developments of AI/carebot technology that remove the human element from care.

Artificial Intelligence-Based Framework for Analyzing Health Care Staff Security 
Practice: Mapping Review and Simulation Study.

BACKGROUND: Blocklisting malicious activities in health care is challenging in 
relation to access control in health care security practices due to the fear of 
preventing legitimate access for therapeutic reasons. Inadvertent prevention of 
legitimate access can contravene the availability trait of the confidentiality, 
integrity, and availability triad, and may result in worsening health 
conditions, leading to serious consequences, including deaths. Therefore, health 
care staff are often provided with a wide range of access such as a 
"breaking-the-glass" or "self-authorization" mechanism for emergency access. 
However, this broad access can undermine the confidentiality and integrity of 
sensitive health care data because breaking-the-glass can lead to vast 
unauthorized access, which could be problematic when determining illegitimate 
access in security practices.
OBJECTIVE: A review was performed to pinpoint appropriate artificial 
intelligence (AI) methods and data sources that can be used for effective 
modeling and analysis of health care staff security practices. Based on 
knowledge obtained from the review, a framework was developed and implemented 
with simulated data to provide a comprehensive approach toward effective 
modeling and analyzing security practices of health care staff in real access 
logs.
METHODS: The flow of our approach was a mapping review to provide AI methods, 
data sources and their attributes, along with other categories as input for 
framework development. To assess implementation of the framework, electronic 
health record (EHR) log data were simulated and analyzed, and the performance of 
various approaches in the framework was compared.
RESULTS: Among the total 130 articles initially identified, 18 met the inclusion 
and exclusion criteria. A thorough assessment and analysis of the included 
articles revealed that K-nearest neighbor, Bayesian network, and decision tree 
(C4.5) algorithms were predominantly applied to EHR and network logs with 
varying input features of health care staff security practices. Based on the 
review results, a framework was developed and implemented with simulated logs. 
The decision tree obtained the best precision of 0.655, whereas the best recall 
was achieved by the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm at 0.977. However, 
the best F1-score was obtained by random forest at 0.775. In brief, three 
classifiers (random forest, decision tree, and SVM) in the two-class approach 
achieved the best precision of 0.998.
CONCLUSIONS: The security practices of health care staff can be effectively 
analyzed using a two-class approach to detect malicious and nonmalicious 
security practices. Based on our comparative study, the algorithms that can 
effectively be used in related studies include random forest, decision tree, and 
SVM. Deviations of security practices from required health care staff's security 
behavior in the big data context can be analyzed with real access logs to define 
appropriate incentives for improving conscious care security practice.

The differentiation-dedifferentiation hypothesis of general cognitive ability 
has been widely studied, but comparable research on crystallized intelligence is 
scarce. To close this gap, we conducted an empirical test of the age 
differentiation hypothesis of declarative knowledge as proposed in Cattell's 
investment theory, which predicts that knowledge differentiates into diverse 
forms after compulsory education ends. Thereto, a cross-sectional sample of 
1,629 participants aged 18-70 years (M = 45.3) completed a comprehensive 
knowledge test comprising 120 broadly sampled questions from 12 knowledge 
domains, as well as a measure of openness/intellect. To investigate age-related 
differences in the level and structure of knowledge, we performed invariance 
tests in local structural equation models. The results did not provide any 
evidence for age-related differentiation of declarative knowledge but indicated 
age-related differences in the mean structure. Higher levels in 
openness/intellect were associated with higher levels in knowledge but not with 
more differentiated structure of knowledge. Contrary to predictions of the 
investment theory, our results suggest that declarative knowledge is age 
invariant across major parts of the adult lifespan. (PsycInfo Database Record

When is it appropriate to infer cognitive impairment on the basis of premorbid 
IQ estimates? A simulation study.

Whether an individual meets psychometric criteria for cognitive impairment is 
dictated by the comparison criterion, which is typically either a normative mean 
or a known or estimated previous level of ability. This study investigated the 
conditions under which adjusting normative expectations based on estimated 
premorbid intelligence would be appropriate. A simulated data set was derived 
and several parameters were systematically varied: the correlation between 
premorbid intelligence and the cognitive test score, the cutoff used to classify 
a score as "normal" or "abnormal", and the population base rate of cognitive 
impairment. Simulation results demonstrated that the correlation between 
premorbid intelligence and the cognitive score was the only parameter to 
substantially influence the trade-off between the two normative approaches, with 
correlations above ρ = .35 signifying greater advantage to adjusting normative 
expectations by premorbid intelligence. These findings inform common 
neuropsychological practices regarding the application of premorbid intelligence 
estimates to the detection of cognitive impairment. (PsycInfo Database Record

INTRODUCTION: Chuna manual therapy (CMT) is a type of manual medicine practiced 
by Korean medical doctors in South Korea. Spinal diagnosis in CMT uses a system 
that applies manual diagnostic and X-ray tests to detect specific vertebral 
malpositions, based on the relative alignment across vertebral bodies. Recently, 
artificial intelligence (AI) programs have been developed to assist in the 
radiological diagnosis of CMT using X-ray images. Nevertheless, a few clinical 
studies have reported on the concordance between diagnosticians, diagnostics 
methodologies, and the use of AI programs for diagnosing CMT. At present, the 
evidence to support CMT diagnosis is insufficient. This study thus aims to 
overcome such limitations by collecting and comparing CMT diagnostic data from 
experts and non-experts through manual diagnosis, X-ray test, and images 
obtained using an AI program. The study aims to search for CMT diagnosis methods 
with more outstanding rationality and consistency and to explore the potential 
use of AI-based CMT diagnosis programs.
METHODS/DESIGN: This study will be conducted as an exploratory, cross-sectional, 
prospective observational study that will recruit 100 non-specialist subjects. 
Each subject will submit a signed consent after the screening test and undergo 
L-spine standing AP & lateral X-ray imaging. Manual CMT diagnosis will be 
performed by 3 CMT experts according to the standard operation procedure (SOP). 
The X-ray images of the 100 subjects will subsequently be used to make the CMT 
radiological diagnoses according to the same SOP by the CMT expert group (n = 3) 
and CMT non-expert group (n = 3). Among the subjects, those in the non-expert 
group will receive another CMT radiological diagnosis with spinal data obtained 
using the AI program, approximately 1 month from after initial diagnosis.Based 
on the collected diagnostic data, within- and between-group concordance levels 
will be assessed for each diagnostic method. The verified level of concordance 
will be used to test the potential use of CMT diagnostic method and CMT AI 
programs with high levels of rationality and consistency.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This trial has received complete ethical approval from 
the Wonkwang University Korean Medicine Hospital (IRB 2021-8). We intend to 
submit the results of the trial to a peer-reviewed journal and/or conferences.

Next generation sequencing generates copious amounts of genomics data, causing 
manual interpretation to be laborious and non-scalable while remaining 
subjective (even for highly trained specialists). We evaluated the performance 
of the artificial intelligence-based offering Watson for Genomics (WfG), a 
variant interpretation platform, in hematologic malignancies for the first 
time.Next generation sequencing was performed for patients treated for various 
hematological malignancies at Hallym University Sacred Heart Hospital, South 
Korea, between December 2017 and August 2020 using a 54-gene panel. Both WfG and 
expert manual curation were used to evaluate the performance of WfG. Acute 
myeloid leukemia (AML) molecular profiles were compared between Koreans and 
other ethnic groups using a publicly available dataset.Seventy-seven patients 
were analyzed (AML: 45, myeloproliferative neoplasms: 12, multiple myeloma: 7, 
myelodysplastic syndromes: 6, and others: 7). The concordance between the manual 
and WfG interpretations of 35 variants in 11 random patients was 94%. Among all 
patients, WfG identified 39 (51%) with at least 1 clinically actionable 
therapeutic alteration (i.e., a variant targeted by a United States Food and 
Drug Administration [US FDA]-approved drug, off-label drug, or clinical trial). 
Moreover, 46% of these patients (18/39) had genes that were targeted by a US 
FDA-approved therapy. WfG identified diagnostic or prognostic insights in 65% of 
the patients with no targetable alterations. In those with AML, FLT3-internal 
tandem duplications or tyrosine kinase domain mutations were less frequent among 
Koreans than among Caucasians (6.7% vs 30.2%, P < .001) or Hispanics (6.7% vs 
28.3%, P = .005), suggesting ethnic differences.Variant interpretation using WfG 
correlated well with manually curated expert opinions. WfG provided therapeutic 
insights (including variant-specific drugs and clinical trials that cannot 
easily be provided by expert manual curation), as well as diagnostic and/or 
prognostic information.

The aim of this retrospective study is to assess any association between 
abdominal CT findings and the radiological stage of COVID-19 pneumonia, 
pulmonary embolism and patient outcomes. We included 158 adult hospitalized 
COVID-19 patients between 1 March 2020 and 1 March 2021 who underwent 206 
abdominal CTs. Two radiologists reviewed all CT images. Pathological findings 
were classified as acute or not. A subset of patients with inflammatory 
pathology in ACE2 organs (bowel, biliary tract, pancreas, urinary system) was 
identified. The radiological stage of COVID pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, 
overall days of hospitalization, ICU admission and outcome were registered. 
Univariate statistical analysis coupled with explainable artificial intelligence 
(AI) techniques were used to discover associations between variables. The most 
frequent acute findings were bowel abnormalities (n = 58), abdominal fluid (n = 
42), hematomas (n = 28) and acute urologic conditions (n = 8). According to 
univariate statistical analysis, pneumonia stage > 2 was significantly 
associated with increased frequency of hematomas, active bleeding and 
fluid-filled colon. The presence of at least one hepatobiliary finding was 
associated with all the COVID-19 stages > 0. Free abdominal fluid, acute 
pathologies in ACE2 organs and fluid-filled colon were associated with ICU 
admission; free fluid also presented poor patient outcomes. Hematomas and active 
bleeding with at least a progressive stage of COVID pneumonia. The explainable 
AI techniques find no strong relationship between variables.

Based on the theory of social change, cultural evolution, and human development, 
we propose a mechanism whereby increased danger in society causes predictable 
shifts in valued forms of intelligence: 1. Practical intelligence rises in value 
relative to abstract intelligence; and 2. social intelligence shifts from 
measuring how well individuals can negotiate the social world to achieve their 
personal aims to measuring how well they can do so to achieve group aims. We 
document these shifts during the COVID-19 pandemic and argue that they led to an 
increase in the size and strength of social movements.

The Transition to Noncommunicable Disease: How to Reduce Its Unsustainable 
Global Burden by Increasing Cognitive Access to Health Self-Management.

The global epidemic of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), such as cardiovascular 
disease and diabetes, is creating unsustainable burdens on health systems 
worldwide. NCDs are treatable but not curable. They are less amenable to 
top-down prevention and control than are the infectious diseases now in retreat. 
NCDs are mostly preventable, but only individuals themselves have the power to 
prevent and manage the diseases to which the enticements of modernity and rising 
prosperity have made them so susceptible (e.g., tobacco, fat-salt-carbohydrate 
laden food products). Rates of nonadherence to healthcare regimens for 
controlling NCDs are high, despite the predictable long-term ravages of not 
self-managing an NCD effectively. I use international data on adult functional 
literacy to show why the cognitive demands of today's NCD self-management 
(NCD-SM) regimens invite nonadherence, especially among individuals of 
below-average or declining cognitive capacity. I then describe ways to improve 
the cognitive accessibility of NCD-SM regimens, where required, so that more 
patients are better able and motivated to self-manage and less likely to err in 
life-threatening ways. For the healthcare professions, I list tools they can 
develop and deploy to increase patients' cognitive access to NCD-SM. 
Epidemiologists could identify more WHO "best buy" interventions to slow or 
reverse the world's "slow-motion disaster" of NCDs were they to add two 
neglected variables when modeling the rising burdens of disease. The neglected 
two are both cognitive: the distribution of cognitive capacity levels of people 
in a population and the cognitive complexity of their health environments.

Hemorrhage is a leading cause of trauma death, particularly in prehospital 
environments when evacuation is delayed. Obtaining central vascular access to a 
deep artery or vein is important for administration of emergency drugs and 
analgesics, and rapid replacement of blood volume, as well as invasive sensing 
and emerging life-saving interventions. However, central access is normally 
performed by highly experienced critical care physicians in a hospital setting. 
We developed a handheld AI-enabled interventional device, AI-GUIDE (Artificial 
Intelligence Guided Ultrasound Interventional Device), capable of directing 
users with no ultrasound or interventional expertise to catheterize a deep blood 
vessel, with an initial focus on the femoral vein. AI-GUIDE integrates with 
widely available commercial portable ultrasound systems and guides a user in 
ultrasound probe localization, venous puncture-point localization, and needle 
insertion. The system performs vascular puncture robotically and incorporates a 
preloaded guidewire to facilitate the Seldinger technique of catheter insertion. 
Results from tissue-mimicking phantom and porcine studies under normotensive and 
hypotensive conditions provide evidence of the technique's robustness, with key 
performance metrics in a live porcine model including: a mean time to acquire 
femoral vein insertion point of 53 ± 36 s (5 users with varying experience, in 
20 trials), a total time to insert catheter of 80 ± 30 s (1 user, in 6 trials), 
and a mean number of 1.1 (normotensive, 39 trials) and 1.3 (hypotensive, 55 
trials) needle insertion attempts (1 user). These performance metrics in a 
porcine model are consistent with those for experienced medical providers 
performing central vascular access on humans in a hospital.

Early detection of skin cancer is of critical importance to provide five year 
survival rates that approach 99%. By 2050, one out of five Americans by age 70 
will develop some form of skin cancer. This will result in a projected rate of 
50 million skin biopsies per year given the current rate of escalation. In 
addition, the ability to differentiate between pigmented lesions and melanomas 
has proven a diagnostic challenge. While dermoscopy and visual analysis are 
useful in identifying many skin lesions, additional non-invasive techniques are 
needed to assist in the analysis of difficult to diagnose skin tumors. To 
augment dermoscopy data, we have developed 3D maps based on physical biomarker 
characteristics of benign and cancerous lesions using vibrational optical 
coherence tomography (VOCT). 3D images based on quantitative physical data 
involving changes in cellular and fibrous tissue stiffness along with changes in 
vascular quality are used to map and evaluate different types of cancers. 3D 
tumor maps constructed using quantitative VOCT data and OCT images have been 
used to characterize the differences between melanoma and other lesions. These 
characteristics can be used to plan the excision of difficult lesions where 
extensive surgery may be needed to remove the entire tumor in one step. In 
addition, it is now possible to use dermoscopy and VOCT to non-invasively 
differentiate between different cancerous lesion types using measurements of the 
resonant frequency of new cellular and vascular peaks. Quantitative VOCT 
information along with dermoscopic findings can be collected and analyzed 
remotely using artificial intelligence to improve cancerous tissue diagnosis.

Nonfullerene, a small molecular electron acceptor, has substantially improved 
the power conversion efficiency of organic photovoltaics (OPVs). However, the 
large structural freedom of π-conjugated polymers and molecules makes it 
difficult to explore with limited resources. Machine learning, which is based on 
rapidly growing artificial intelligence technology, is a high-throughput method 
to accelerate the speed of material design and process optimization; however, it 
suffers from limitations in terms of prediction accuracy, interpretability, data 
collection, and available data (particularly, experimental data). This 
recognition motivates the present Perspective, which focuses on utilizing the 
experimental data set for ML to efficiently aid OPV research. This Perspective 
discusses the trends in ML-OPV publications, the NFA category, and the effects 
of data size and explanatory variables (fingerprints or Mordred descriptors) on 
the prediction accuracy and explainability, which broadens the scope of ML and 
would be useful for the development of next-generation solar cell materials.

Predicting novel small molecule bioactivities for the target deconvolution, 
hit-to-lead optimization in drug discovery research, requires molecular 
representation. Previous reports have demonstrated that machine learning (ML) 
and deep learning (DL) have substantial implications in virtual screening, 
peptide synthesis, drug ADMET screening and biomarker discovery. These 
strategies can increase the positive outcomes in the drug discovery process 
without false-positive rates and can be achieved in a cost-effective way with a 
minimum duration of time by high-quality data acquisition. This review 
substantially discusses the recent updates in AI tools as cheminformatics 
application in medicinal chemistry for the data-driven decision making of drug 
discovery and challenges in high-quality data acquisition in the pharmaceutical 
industry while improving small-molecule bioactivities and properties.

The application of artificial intelligence (AI) technology in the medical field 
has experienced a long history of development. In turn, some long-standing 
points and challenges in the medical field have also prompted diverse research 
teams to continue to explore AI in depth. With the development of advanced 
technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, big data, 
and 5G mobile networks, AI technology has been more widely adopted in the 
medical field. In addition, the in-depth integration of AI and IoT technology 
enables the gradual improvement of medical diagnosis and treatment capabilities 
so as to provide services to the public in a more effective way. In this work, 
we examine the technical basis of IoT, cloud computing, big data analysis and 
machine learning involved in clinical medicine, combined with concepts of 
specific algorithms such as activity recognition, behavior recognition, anomaly 
detection, assistant decision-making system, to describe the scenario-based 
applications of remote diagnosis and treatment collaboration, neonatal intensive 
care unit, cardiology intensive care unit, emergency first aid, venous 
thromboembolism, monitoring nursing, image-assisted diagnosis, etc. We also 
systematically summarize the application of AI and IoT in clinical medicine, 
analyze the main challenges thereof, and comment on the trends and future 
developments in this field.

Toxicological Research, United States Food and Drug Administration, Jefferson, 
AR, United States.

Background & Aims: The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
regulates a broad range of consumer products, which account for about 25% of the 
United States market. The FDA regulatory activities often involve producing and 
reading of a large number of documents, which is time consuming and labor 
intensive. To support regulatory science at FDA, we evaluated artificial 
intelligence (AI)-based natural language processing (NLP) of regulatory 
documents for text classification and compared deep learning-based models with a 
conventional keywords-based model. Methods: FDA drug labeling documents were 
used as a representative regulatory data source to classify drug-induced liver 
injury (DILI) risk by employing the state-of-the-art language model BERT. The 
resulting NLP-DILI classification model was statistically validated with both 
internal and external validation procedures and applied to the labeling data 
from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for cross-agency application. Results: 
The NLP-DILI model developed using FDA labeling documents and evaluated by 
cross-validations in this study showed remarkable performance in DILI 
classification with a recall of 1 and a precision of 0.78. When cross-agency 
data were used to validate the model, the performance remained comparable, 
demonstrating that the model was portable across agencies. Results also 
suggested that the model was able to capture the semantic meanings of sentences 
in drug labeling. Conclusion: Deep learning-based NLP models performed well in 
DILI classification of drug labeling documents and learned the meanings of 
complex text in drug labeling. This proof-of-concept work demonstrated that 
using AI technologies to assist regulatory activities is a promising approach to 
modernize and advance regulatory science.

The application of machine learning has rapidly evolved in medicine over the 
past decade. In stroke, commercially available machine learning algorithms have 
already been incorporated into clinical application for rapid diagnosis. The 
creation and advancement of deep learning techniques have greatly improved 
clinical utilization of machine learning tools and new algorithms continue to 
emerge with improved accuracy in stroke diagnosis and outcome prediction. 
Although imaging-based feature recognition and segmentation have significantly 
facilitated rapid stroke diagnosis and triaging, stroke prognostication is 
dependent on a multitude of patient specific as well as clinical factors and 
hence accurate outcome prediction remains challenging. Despite its vital role in 
stroke diagnosis and prognostication, it is important to recognize that machine 
learning output is only as good as the input data and the appropriateness of 
algorithm applied to any specific data set. Additionally, many studies on 
machine learning tend to be limited by small sample size and hence concerted 
efforts to collate data could improve evaluation of future machine learning 
tools in stroke. In the present state, machine learning technology serves as a 
helpful and efficient tool for rapid clinical decision making while oversight 
from clinical experts is still required to address specific aspects not 
accounted for in an automated algorithm. This article provides an overview of 
machine learning technology and a tabulated review of pertinent machine learning 
studies related to stroke diagnosis and outcome prediction.

Creativity and Life Satisfaction in Spanish University Students. Effects of an 
Emotionally Positive and Creative Program.

There is an increasing demand by society that university students demonstrate 
competitive skills to enable them to achieve greater success when entering the 
workplace. Creativity and life satisfaction correlate positively with academic 
performance, productivity, and excellence in the working environment. The 
presence of creativity and emotional intelligence in the curriculum and teaching 
methods in Spanish universities, however, is surprisingly lacking. Studies that 
examine gender differences in these variables provide conflicting results. The 
purpose of our research is to analyse the changes produced in both creativity 
and life satisfaction in university students by a positive emotional and 
creative intervention and explore individual differences by gender. The 
methodology used was a quasi-experimental pre- test/post- test design with 
experimental/control groups. Three hundred university students (23% men and 77% 
women) from the Community of Madrid (Spain) completed three exercises that 
evaluated creativity and life satisfaction. The results show significantly 
higher results in creativity and life satisfaction in women, who continued to 
achieve high results after the intervention. Finally, we discuss the need for 
emotional and creative education in universities and focus on the employability 
and the guarantee of equal opportunities through the development of these 
competencies.

Background: Antiarrhythmic drugs are the first-line treatment for atrial 
fibrillation (AF), but their effect is highly dependent on the characteristics 
of the patient. Moreover, anatomical variability, and specifically atrial size, 
have also a strong influence on AF recurrence. Objective: We performed a 
proof-of-concept study using artificial intelligence (AI) that enabled us to 
identify proarrhythmic profiles based on pattern identification from in silico 
simulations. Methods: A population of models consisting of 127 
electrophysiological profiles with a variation of nine electrophysiological 
variables (G Na , I NaK , G K1, G CaL , G Kur , I KCa , [Na] ext , and [K] ext 
and diffusion) was simulated using the Koivumaki atrial model on square planes 
corresponding to a normal (16 cm2) and dilated (22.5 cm2) atrium. The simple 
pore channel equation was used for drug implementation including three drugs 
(isoproterenol, flecainide, and verapamil). We analyzed the effect of every 
ionic channel combination to evaluate arrhythmia induction. A Random Forest 
algorithm was trained using the population of models and AF inducibility as 
input and output, respectively. The algorithm was trained with 80% of the data 
(N = 832) and 20% of the data was used for testing with a k-fold 
cross-validation (k = 5). Results: We found two electrophysiological patterns 
derived from the AI algorithm that was associated with proarrhythmic behavior in 
most of the profiles, where G K1 was identified as the most important current 
for classifying the proarrhythmicity of a given profile. Additionally, we found 
different effects of the drugs depending on the electrophysiological profile and 
a higher tendency of the dilated tissue to fibrillate (Small tissue: 80 profiles 
vs Dilated tissue: 87 profiles). Conclusion: Artificial intelligence algorithms 
appear as a novel tool for electrophysiological pattern identification and 
analysis of the effect of antiarrhythmic drugs on a heterogeneous population of 
patients with AF.

Diabetic kidney disease is an important and common cause of end-stage renal 
disease. Measurement of urinary albumin excretion (UAE) requires the diagnosis 
of the stage of diabetic nephropathy and the prognosis of renal function. We 
aimed to analyze the impact of lifestyle modification on UAE in patients with 
stage 2 and 3 type 2 diabetic nephropathy who received comprehensive medical 
care, using a generalized additive model (GAM), an explanatory machine learning 
model. In this retrospective observational study, we used changes in HbA1c, 
systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) levels; body 
mass index (BMI); and daily salt intake as factors contributing to changes in 
UAE. In total, 269 patients with type 2 diabetic nephropathy were enrolled 
(stage 2, 217 patients; stage 3, 52 patients). The rankings that contributed to 
changes in UAE over 6 months by permutation importance were the changes in daily 
salt intake, HbA1c, SBP, DBP, and BMI. GAM, which predicts the change in UAE, 
showed that with increase in the changes in salt intake, SBP, and HbA1c, the 
delta UAE tended to increase. Salt intake was the most contributory factor for 
the changes in UAE, and daily salt intake was the best lifestyle factor to 
explain the changes in UAE. Strict control of salt intake may have beneficial 
effects on improving UAE in patients with stage 2 and 3 diabetic nephropathy.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with marked heterogeneity with 
respect to the development of executive function abilities. The bilingual 
advantage refers to the observation that individuals who speak two languages 
perform better on executive function tasks than monolinguals under some 
circumstances. There is not yet consensus, however, as to whether this advantage 
can be reliably demonstrated, nor is there consensus regarding under which 
conditions it emerges. Bilingual and monolingual children with ASD have 
comparable developmental outcomes, particularly in the areas of core ASD 
symptoms, cognitive function, and language. Still, despite the potential 
advantages that bilingualism may confer, clinicians commonly advise against 
providing a bilingual environment for children with ASD. The purpose of the 
present review is to provide an up-to-date assessment of the limited literature 
on bilingualism in children with ASD in order to inform evidence-based practice. 
Studies suggest a potential bilingual advantage in ASD in the areas of nonverbal 
intelligence quotient, adaptive functioning, and expressive vocabulary. A 
limited yet growing literature provides preliminary evidence for enhanced 
executive function ability in some children with ASD. Taken together, current 
evidence suggests that although a bilingual advantage may not be universally 
present in typical development, it may manifest under specific circumstances, 
conferring advantage for populations in which executive function is compromised. 
Further work is needed to develop consistent, evidence-based guidelines around 
language recommendations for families of children with ASD and to better 
understand the cognitive and brain mechanisms giving rise to the bilingual 
advantage in clinical developmental populations.

This study was concerned with how accurate people are in their knowledge of 
population norms and statistics concerning such things as the economic, health 
and religious status of a nation and how those estimates are related to their 
own demography (e.g age, sex), ideology (political and religious beliefs) and 
intelligence. Just over 600 adults were asked to make 25 population estimates 
for Great Britain, including religious (church/mosque attendance) and economic 
(income, state benefits, car/house ownership) factors as well as estimates like 
the number of gay people, immigrants, smokers etc. They were reasonably accurate 
for things like car ownership, criminal record, vegetarianism and voting but 
seriously overestimated numbers related to minorities such as the prevalence of 
gay people, muslims and people not born in the UK. Conversely there was a 
significant underestimation of people receiving state benefits, having a 
criminal record or a private health insurance. Correlations between select 
variables and magnitude and absolute accuracy showed religiousness and IQ most 
significant correlates. Religious people were less, and intelligent people more, 
accurate in their estimates. A factor analysis of the estimates revealed five 
interpretable factors. Regressions were calculated onto these factors and showed 
how these individual differences accounted for as much as 14% of the variance. 
Implications and limitations are acknowledged.

Despite the technological advancements in Virtual Reality (VR), users are 
constantly combating feelings of nausea and disorientation, the so-called 
cybersickness. Cybersickness symptoms cause severe discomfort and hinder the 
immersive VR experience. Here we investigated cybersickness in 360-degree 
head-mounted display VR. In traditional 360-degree VR experiences, translational 
movement in the real world is not reflected in the virtual world, and therefore 
self-motion information is not corroborated by matching visual and vestibular 
cues, which may trigger symptoms of cybersickness. We evaluated whether a new 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) software designed to supplement the 360-degree VR 
experience with artificial six-degrees-of-freedom motion may reduce 
cybersickness. Explicit (simulator sickness questionnaire and Fast Motion 
Sickness (FMS) rating) and implicit (heart rate) measurements were used to 
evaluate cybersickness symptoms during and after 360-degree VR exposure. 
Simulator sickness scores showed a significant reduction in feelings of nausea 
during the AI-supplemented six-degrees-of-freedom motion VR compared to 
traditional 360-degree VR. However, six-degrees-of-freedom motion VR did not 
reduce oculomotor or disorientation measures of sickness. No changes were 
observed in FMS and heart rate measures. Improving the congruency between visual 
and vestibular cues in 360-degree VR, as provided by the AI-supplemented 
six-degrees-of-freedom motion system considered, is essential for a more 
engaging, immersive and safe VR experience, which is critical for educational, 
cultural and entertainment applications.

PURPOSE: The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) eighth edition schema for 
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma treats T and N stage as independent factors and 
uses positive lymph nodes (PLNs) to define N stage, despite data favoring lymph 
node ratio (LNR). We used artificial intelligence-based techniques to compare 
PLN with LNR and investigate interactions between tumor size and nodal status.
METHODS: Patients who underwent pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma resection 
between 2000 and 2017 at six institutions were identified. LNR and PLN were 
compared through shapley additive explanations (SHAP) analysis, with the best 
predictor used to define nodal status. We trained optimal classification trees 
(OCTs) to predict 1-year and 3-year risk of death, incorporating only tumor size 
and nodal status as variables. The OCTs were compared with the AJCC schema and 
similarly trained XGBoost models. Variable interactions were explored via SHAP.
RESULTS: Two thousand eight hundred seventy-four patients comprised the 
derivation and 1,231 the validation cohort. SHAP identified LNR as a superior 
predictor. The OCTs outperformed the AJCC schema in the derivation and 
validation cohorts (1-year area under the curve: 0.681 v 0.603; 0.638 v 0.586, 
3-year area under the curve: 0.682 v 0.639; 0.675 v 0.647, respectively) and 
performed comparably with the XGBoost models. We identified interactions between 
LNR and tumor size, suggesting that a negative prognostic factor partially 
overrides the effect of a concurrent favorable factor.
CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the superiority of LNR and the importance of 
interactions between tumor size and nodal status. These results and the 
potential of the OCT methodology to combine them into a powerful, visually 
interpretable model can help inform future staging systems.

Fibrogenic processes instigate fatal chronic diseases leading to organ failure 
and death. Underlying biological processes involve induced massive deposition of 
extracellular matrix (ECM) by aberrant fibroblasts. We subjected diseased 
primary human lung fibroblasts to an advanced three-dimensional phenotypic 
high-content assay and screened a repurposing drug library of small molecules 
for inhibiting ECM deposition. Fibrotic Pattern Detection by Artificial 
Intelligence identified tranilast as an effective inhibitor. Structure-activity 
relationship studies confirmed N-(2-butoxyphenyl)-3-(phenyl)acrylamides (N23Ps) 
as a novel and highly potent compound class. N23Ps suppressed myofibroblast 
transdifferentiation, ECM deposition, cellular contractility, and altered cell 
shapes, thus advocating a unique mode of action. Mechanistically, 
transcriptomics identified SMURF2 as a potential therapeutic target network. 
Antifibrotic activity of N23Ps was verified by proteomics in a human ex vivo 
tissue fibrosis disease model, suppressing profibrotic markers SERPINE1 and 
CXCL8. Conclusively, N23Ps are a novel class of highly potent compounds 
inhibiting organ fibrosis in patients.

PURPOSE: Smartphones are used in cervical screening for visual inspection after 
acetic acid or Lugol's iodine (VIA/VILI) application to capture and share images 
to improve the sensitivity and interobserver variability of VIA/VILI. We 
undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis assessing the diagnostic 
accuracy of smartphone images of the cervix at the time of VIA/VILI (termed 
S-VIA) in the detection of precancerous lesions in women undergoing cervical 
screening.
METHODS: This systematic review was conducted in accordance with Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Studies 
from January 1, 2010, to June 30, 2020, were assessed. MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, 
CINAHL, Cochrane, and LILACS were searched. Cohort and cross-sectional studies 
were considered. S-VIA was compared with the reference standard of 
histopathology. We excluded studies where additional technology was added to the 
smartphone including artificial intelligence, enhanced visual assessment, and 
other algorithms to automatically diagnose precancerous lesions. The primary 
outcome was the accuracy of S-VIA for the diagnosis of cervical intraepithelial 
neoplasia grade 2 or greater (CIN 2+). Data were extracted, and we plotted the 
sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive 
value of S-VIA using forest plots. This study was prospectively registered with 
The International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews:CRD42020204024.
RESULTS: Six thousand three studies were screened, 71 full texts assessed, and 
eight studies met criteria for inclusion, with six included in the final 
meta-analysis. The sensitivity of S-VIA for the diagnosis of CIN 2+ was 74.56% 
(95% CI, 70.16 to 78.95; I2 61.30%), specificity was 61.75% (95% CI, 56.35 to 
67.15; I2 95.00%), negative predictive value was 93.71% (95% CI, 92.81 to 94.61; 
I2 0%), and positive predictive value was 26.97% (95% CI, 24.13 to 29.81; I2 
61.3%).
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that S-VIA has accuracy in the detection of CIN 
2+ and may provide additional support to health care providers delivering care 
in low-resource settings.

A growing number of sectors are delivering customer services powered by 
artificial intelligence (AI) instead of humans, with evidence indicating labor 
cost reduction and efficiency improvement. However, it would be worthwhile to 
examine the extent to which consumers are satisfied with AI service agents. In 
two studies based on an analysis of 17,673 Weibo data (Study 1) and 33 
interviews (Study 2), we constructed a pair of theoretical models of consumer 
attitudes toward AI services: a sentiment model and an evaluation model. The 
results from Weibo data analysis showed that consumers display a stronger 
negative attitude toward AI customer service than toward their human 
counterparts. Complaints regarding AI customer service is mainly about its poor 
problem-solving ability, while untimely response and lack of human touch also 
dissatisfy customers. Whether consumers offer positive feedback mainly depends 
on voice traits and service attitudes. The results from the interviews confirm 
an overall negative attitude of consumers toward AI customer service. Consumers 
also recognize AI customer service agents as human like and social interaction 
stress relieving. Taken together, these findings reveal Chinese customers' 
attitudes toward AI service solutions and provide concrete suggestions for the 
development and upgrade of AI customer services.

Memory is a dynamic process that is based on and can be altered by experiences. 
Integrating memories of multiple experiences (memory integration) is the basis 
of flexible and complex decision-making. However, the mechanism of memory 
integration in neural networks of the brain remains poorly understood. In this 
study, we built a recurrent spiking network model and investigated the neural 
mechanism of memory integration before a decision is made (retrospective memory 
integration) at the neural circuit level. Our simulations suggest that 
retrospective memory integration accompanies reconfiguration of neural cell 
assemblies. Additionally, partially blocking neural network plasticity leads to 
failure of memory integration. These findings can potentially guide the 
experimental investigation of the neural mechanism of retrospective memory 
integration and serve as the basis for developing new artificial intelligence 
algorithms.

AIMS: The purpose of this study was to construct a model for oral assessment 
using deep learning image recognition technology and to verify its accuracy.
BACKGROUND: The effects of oral care on older people are significant, and the 
Oral Assessment Guide has been used internationally as an effective oral 
assessment tool in clinical practice. However, additional training, education, 
development of user manuals and continuous support from a dental hygienist are 
needed to improve the inter-rater reliability of the Oral Assessment Guide.
DESIGN: A retrospective observational study.
METHODS: A total of 3,201 oral images of 114 older people aged >65 years were 
collected from five dental-related facilities. These images were divided into 
six categories (lips, tongue, saliva, mucosa, gingiva, and teeth or dentures) 
that were evaluated by images, out of the total eight items that comprise 
components of the Oral Assessment Guide. Each item was classified into a rating 
of 1, 2 or 3. A convolutional neural network, which is a deep learning method 
used for image recognition, was used to construct the image recognition model. 
The study methods comply with the STROBE checklist.
RESULTS: We constructed models with a classification accuracy of 98.8% for lips, 
94.3% for tongue, 92.8% for saliva, 78.6% for mucous membranes, 93.0% for 
gingiva and 93.6% for teeth or dentures.
CONCLUSIONS: Highly accurate diagnostic imaging models using convolutional 
neural networks were constructed for six items of the Oral Assessment Guide and 
validated. In particular, for the five items of lips, tongue, saliva, gingiva, 
and teeth or dentures, models with a high accuracy of over 90% were obtained.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The model built in this study has the potential 
to contribute to obtain reproducibility and reliability of the ratings, to 
shorten the time for assessment, to collaborate with dental professionals and to 
be used as an educational tool.

With the proliferation of non-linear loads in electricity supply industry, 
interests in improving quality of electrical supply have increased 
significantly. Power quality challenges have generated disputes between 
customers, network operators and equipment manufacturers globally. 
Identification of the sources of harmonics, and the quantification of the 
identified variables at the points of common coupling (PCC) pose challenges in 
the electricity supply industry. Critical in the determination of the harmonic 
contributions are data for harmonic distortions in phase currents and voltages, 
power factor, apparent power, active power, reactive power, and frequency. The 
data were obtained at the PCC between 5 different arc furnace steel plant and 
the transmission network. The data were captured at 33kV and 132kV voltage level 
at the steel plant PCC using a Circuitor AR6 power analyser connected through 
incoming voltage transformers (VTs) and current transformers (CTs). Histograms 
and cumulative probability distribution plots present the harmonic contents of 
the data. This data can be reused for artificial intelligence and machine 
learning application in real-time monitoring of state of health at the PCC and 
design of filter networks to mitigate harmonics.

We report an unknown taxon of bot fly (Diptera: Oestridae: Oestrinae) in red 
river hogs (Potamochoerus porcus Linnaeus, 1758) in Cross River State, Nigeria. 
From direct observation and interviews with local hunters, we document that, 
remarkably, the parasite typically occurs within the intracranial 
supra-meningeal space - i.e., between the inner wall of the skull and the brain 
- but without causing visible inflammation or clinical signs. The parasite is 
most similar (up to 87.9%) to Rhinoestrus usbekistanicus based on cytochrome 
oxidase subunit 1 DNA sequencing but is sufficiently divergent phylogenetically 
to represent a new or previously un-sequenced taxon. Morphologically, the 
parasite shares some, but not all, features with R. nivarleti. Local cultural 
belief systems attribute aspects of red river hog behavior (e.g. intelligence, 
elusiveness) to the parasite, suggesting a prolonged presence in the red river 
hog population. The parasite's unusual anatomic location may be aberrant, or it 
may be a protective adaptation to life in red river hogs, which forage 
vigorously with their snouts.

The rapid emergence of the novel SARS-CoV-2 poses a challenge and has attracted 
worldwide attention. Artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to combat this 
pandemic and control the spread of the virus. In particular, deep learning-based 
time-series techniques are used to predict worldwide COVID-19 cases for 
short-term and medium-term dependencies using adaptive learning. This study 
aimed to predict daily COVID-19 cases and investigate the critical factors that 
increase the transmission rate of this outbreak by examining different 
influential factors. Furthermore, the study analyzed the effectiveness of 
COVID-19 prevention measures. A fully connected deep neural network, long 
short-term memory (LSTM), and transformer model were used as the AI models for 
the prediction of new COVID-19 cases. Initially, data preprocessing and feature 
extraction were performed using COVID-19 datasets from Saudi Arabia. The 
performance metrics for all models were computed, and the results were subjected 
to comparative analysis to detect the most reliable model. Additionally, 
statistical hypothesis analysis and correlation analysis were performed on the 
COVID-19 datasets by including features such as daily mobility, total cases, 
people fully vaccinated per hundred, weekly hospital admissions per million, 
intensive care unit patients, and new deaths per million. The results show that 
the LSTM algorithm had the highest accuracy of all the algorithms and an error 
of less than 2%. The findings of this study contribute to our understanding of 
COVID-19 containment. This study also provides insights into the prevention of 
future outbreaks.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is common in immune-mediated inflammatory diseases 
(IMIDs) and it is predominately attributed to the interplay between chronic 
inflammation and traditional CVD risk factors. CVD has significant impact on the 
survival of patients with IMIDs as it is associated with increased morbidity and 
mortality. Despite recommendations for monitoring and managing CVD in patients 
with IMIDs, the individual CVD risk assessment remains problematic as CVD risk 
calculators for the general population consistently underestimate the risk in 
patients with IMIDs. Application of new technologies utilizing artificial 
intelligence techniques have shown promising potential for tailoring predictive 
medicine to the individual patient, but further validation of their role in 
clinical decision-making is warranted. In the meantime, individuals with IMIDs 
should be encouraged to adopt behavioral interventions targeting at modifiable 
lifestyle CVD risk factors, whereas rheumatologists need to be well aware of the 
unfavorable effects of antirheumatic medication on various CVD risk factors and 
outcomes. In the current paper, we aim to provide an overview of current and 
emerging strategies for mitigating CVD risk in patients with IMIDs, based on a 
practical approach.

From Personalized Medicine to Precision Psychiatry?

Personalised medicine aims to find an individualized approach for each 
particular patient. Most factors used in current psychiatry, however, depend on 
the assessment made by the individual clinician and lack a higher degree of 
reliability. Precision medicine bases decisions on quantifiable indicators 
available thanks to the tremendous progress in science and technology 
facilitating the acquisition, processing and analysis of huge amounts of data. 
So far, psychiatry has not been benefiting enough from the advanced diagnostic 
technologies; nevertheless, we are witnessing the dawn of the era of precision 
psychiatry, starting with the gathering of sufficient amounts of data and its 
analysis by the means of artificial intelligence and machine learning. First 
results of this approach in psychiatry are available, which facilitate diagnosis 
assessment, course prediction, and appropriate treatment choice. These processes 
are often so complex and difficult to understand that they may resemble a "black 
box", which can slow down the acceptance of the results of this approach in 
clinical practice. Still, bringing precision medicine including psychiatry to 
standard clinical practice is a big challenge that can result in a completely 
new and transformative concept of health care. Such extensive changes naturally 
have both their supporters and opponents. This paper aims to familiarize 
clinically oriented physicians with precision psychiatry and to attract their 
attention to its recent developments. We cover the theoretical basis of 
precision medicine, its specifics in psychiatry, and provide examples of its use 
in the field of diagnostic assessment, course prediction, and appropriate 
treatment planning.

Researchers in areas as diverse as computer science and political science must 
increasingly navigate the possible risks of their research to society. However, 
the history of medical experiments on vulnerable individuals influenced many 
research ethics reviews to focus exclusively on risks to human subjects rather 
than risks to human society. We describe an Ethics and Society Review board 
(ESR), which fills this moral gap by facilitating ethical and societal 
reflection as a requirement to access grant funding: Researchers cannot receive 
grant funding from participating programs until the researchers complete the ESR 
process for their proposal. Researchers author an initial statement describing 
their proposed research's risks to society, subgroups within society, and 
globally and commit to mitigation strategies for these risks. An 
interdisciplinary faculty panel iterates with the researchers to refine these 
risks and mitigation strategies. We describe a mixed-method evaluation of the 
ESR over 1 y, in partnership with a large artificial intelligence grant program 
at our university. Surveys and interviews of researchers who interacted with the 
ESR found 100% (95% CI: 87 to 100%) were willing to continue submitting future 
projects to the ESR, and 58% (95% CI: 37 to 77%) felt that it had influenced the 
design of their research project. The ESR panel most commonly identified issues 
of harms to minority groups, inclusion of diverse stakeholders in the research 
plan, dual use, and representation in datasets. These principles, paired with 
possible mitigation strategies, offer scaffolding for future research designs.

Prognostic scoring systems and risk stratification in myelodysplastic syndrome: 
focus on integration of molecular profile.

Institute, Tampa, FL, USA.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) form a clinically and molecularly heterogeneous 
disease group. Precise risk stratification remains crucial for choosing optimal 
management strategies. Several conventional prognostic scoring systems have been 
developed and validated in the MDS population. These risk models divide patients 
into prognostic subgroups based on clinical and cytogenetic characteristics. 
Lack of dynamicity, variable risk estimate across models, and heterogeneity 
within intermediate-risk group are the limitations of traditional models like 
IPSS-R, with questionable relevance of these scoring systems in treated MDS 
patients. Recent progress in next-generation sequencing techniques has improved 
understanding of the distribution and prognostic importance of recurrent genetic 
mutations in MDS. Early studies have suggested that incorporating mutations in 
risk stratification could supplement IPSS-R in further refining the model's 
performance in predicting overall survival and risk of transformation to acute 
myeloid leukemia and should translate into a molecularly driven prognostication 
approach in the near future.

OBJECTIVES: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in medicine, but 
data on benign prostatic enlargement (BPE) management are lacking. This study 
aims to test the performance of several machine learning algorithms, in 
predicting clinical outcomes during BPE surgical management.
METHODS: Clinical data were extracted from a prospectively collected database 
for 153 men with BPE, treated with transurethral resection (monopolar or 
bipolar) or vaporization of the prostate. Due to small sample size, we applied a 
method for increasing our dataset, Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique 
(SMOTE). The new dataset created with SMOTE has been expanded by 453 synthetic 
instances, in addition to the original 153. The WEKA Data Mining Software was 
used for constructing predictive models, while several appropriate statistical 
measures, like Correlation coefficient (R), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root 
Mean-Squared Error (RMSE), were calculated with several supervised regression 
algorithms - techniques (Linear Regression, Multilayer Perceptron, SMOreg, 
k-Nearest Neighbors, Bagging, M5Rules, M5P - Pruned Model Tree, and Random 
forest).
RESULTS: The baseline characteristics of patients were extracted, with age, 
prostate volume, method of operation, baseline Qmax and baseline IPSS being used 
as independent variables. Using the Random Forest algorithm resulted in values 
of R, MAE, RMSE that indicate the ability of these models to better predict % 
Qmax increase. The Random Forest model also demonstrated the best results in R, 
MAE, RMSE for predicting % IPSS reduction.
CONCLUSIONS: Machine Learning techniques can be used for making predictions 
regarding clinical outcomes of surgical BPRE management. Wider-scale validation 
studies are necessary to strengthen our results in choosing the best model.

BACKGROUND: Atypical cartilaginous tumour (ACT) and grade II chondrosarcoma 
(CS2) of long bones are respectively managed with watchful waiting or curettage 
and wide resection. Preoperatively, imaging diagnosis can be challenging due to 
interobserver variability and biopsy suffers from sample errors. The aim of this 
study is to determine diagnostic performance of MRI radiomics-based machine 
learning in differentiating ACT from CS2 of long bones.
METHODS: One-hundred-fifty-eight patients with surgically treated and 
histology-proven cartilaginous bone tumours were retrospectively included at two 
tertiary bone tumour centres. The training cohort consisted of 93 MRI scans from 
centre 1 (n=74 ACT; n=19 CS2). The external test cohort consisted of 65 MRI 
scans from centre 2 (n=45 ACT; n=20 CS2). Bidimensional segmentation was 
performed on T1-weighted MRI. Radiomic features were extracted. After 
dimensionality reduction and class balancing in centre 1, a machine-learning 
classifier (Extra Trees Classifier) was tuned on the training cohort using 
10-fold cross-validation and tested on the external test cohort. In centre 2, 
its performance was compared with an experienced musculoskeletal oncology 
radiologist using McNemar's test.
FINDINGS: After tuning on the training cohort (AUC=0.88), the machine-learning 
classifier had 92% accuracy (60/65, AUC=0.94) in identifying the lesions in the 
external test cohort. Its accuracies in correctly classifying ACT and CS2 were 
98% (44/45) and 80% (16/20), respectively. The radiologist had 98% accuracy 
(64/65) with no difference compared to the classifier (p=0.134).
INTERPRETATION: Machine learning showed high accuracy in classifying ACT and CS2 
of long bones based on MRI radiomic features.

BACKGROUND: Contact with nature may have a key role in child brain development. 
Recent observational studies have reported improvements in children's 
neuropsychological development and mental health associated with greenness 
exposure. In a rapidly urbanizing word, researchers, policymakers, healthcare 
workers and urban planners need to work together to elaborate evidence-based 
policies and interventions to increase the availability of quality green space 
with the potential to enhance childhood development.
OBJECTIVE: To review the observational evidence assessing the effect of exposure 
to greenness on children's neuropsychological development and mental health.
METHODS: The protocol for the review was preregistered at PROSPERO 
(CRD42020213838). The Navigation Guide systematic review methodology was 
followed. Search strategies were formulated and adapted to each database. 
Searches were performed in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and EBSCO's GreenFILE 
on October 5, 2021. Additional articles were further identified by 
hand-searching reference lists of included papers.
RESULTS: A systematic search of 4 databases identified 621 studies, of which 34 
were included in the review. The studies included investigated diverse domains 
within neuropsychological development and mental health, such as attention, 
working memory, intelligence, cognitive development, academic performance, 
well-being, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms, and behavior. 
Most of the studies were rated as having high or probably high risk of bias in 
the assessment.
DISCUSSION: Although nearly all studies showed a positive association between 
greenness exposure and the outcomes studied, the heterogeneity in the methods 
used to assess exposure and the diversity of domains within each main outcome 
has made it difficult to draw clear conclusions. Future studies should adopt a 
longitudinal design to confirm the causality of the associations and include 
measures to determine which characteristics of greenness have the greatest 
influence on each domain. Researchers should also try to explore pathways 
linking exposure to greenness with the neuropsychological development and mental 
health, by implementing mechanistic studies.

Variation in the neural code contributes to making each individual unique. We 
probed neural code variation using ∼100 population recordings from major 
ganglion cell types in the macaque retina, combined with an interpretable 
computational representation of individual variability. This representation 
captured variation and covariation in properties such as nonlinearity, temporal 
dynamics, and spatial receptive field size and preserved invariances such as 
asymmetries between On and Off cells. The covariation of response properties in 
different cell types was associated with the proximity of lamination of their 
synaptic input. Surprisingly, male retinas exhibited higher firing rates and 
faster temporal integration than female retinas. Exploiting data from previously 
recorded retinas enabled efficient characterization of a new macaque retina, and 
of a human retina. Simulations indicated that combining a large dataset of 
retinal recordings with behavioral feedback could reveal the neural code in a 
living human and thus improve vision restoration with retinal implants.

Previous studies in adults showed heterogeneous results regarding the 
associations of personality with intelligence and executive functions (EF). In 
children, there is a lack of studies investigating the relations between 
personality and EF. Therefore, the aim of our study was to examine the relations 
between the Big Five personality traits, EF, and intelligence in a sample of 
children (Experiment 1) and young adults (Experiment 2). A total of 155 children 
(Experiment 1, mean age = 9.54 years) and 91 young adults (Experiment 2, mean 
age = 23.49 years) participated in the two studies. In both studies, 
participants performed tasks measuring working memory (WM), inhibitory control, 
cognitive flexibility, and fluid intelligence and completed a personality 
questionnaire. In Experiment 1, we found a negative relation between neuroticism 
and intelligence. In Experiment 2, we found a positive relation between 
conscientiousness and intelligence and a positive relation between 
conscientiousness and cognitive flexibility. Our results suggest a complex 
interplay between personality factors, EF, and intelligence both in children as 
well as in young adults.

Background Missed fractures are a common cause of diagnostic discrepancy between 
initial radiographic interpretation and the final read by board-certified 
radiologists. Purpose To assess the effect of assistance by artificial 
intelligence (AI) on diagnostic performances of physicians for fractures on 
radiographs. Materials and Methods This retrospective diagnostic study used the 
multi-reader, multi-case methodology based on an external multicenter data set 
of 480 examinations with at least 60 examinations per body region (foot and 
ankle, knee and leg, hip and pelvis, hand and wrist, elbow and arm, shoulder and 
clavicle, rib cage, and thoracolumbar spine) between July 2020 and January 2021. 
Fracture prevalence was set at 50%. The ground truth was determined by two 
musculoskeletal radiologists, with discrepancies solved by a third. Twenty-four 
readers (radiologists, orthopedists, emergency physicians, physician assistants, 
rheumatologists, family physicians) were presented the whole validation data set 
(n = 480), with and without AI assistance, with a 1-month minimum washout 
period. The primary analysis had to demonstrate superiority of sensitivity per 
patient and the noninferiority of specificity per patient at -3% margin with AI 
aid. Stand-alone AI performance was also assessed using receiver operating 
characteristic curves. Results A total of 480 patients were included (mean age, 
59 years ± 16 [standard deviation]; 327 women). The sensitivity per patient was 
10.4% higher (95% CI: 6.9, 13.9; P < .001 for superiority) with AI aid (4331 of 
5760 readings, 75.2%) than without AI (3732 of 5760 readings, 64.8%). The 
specificity per patient with AI aid (5504 of 5760 readings, 95.6%) was 
noninferior to that without AI aid (5217 of 5760 readings, 90.6%), with a 
difference of +5.0% (95% CI: +2.0, +8.0; P = .001 for noninferiority). AI 
shortened the average reading time by 6.3 seconds per examination (95% CI: 
-12.5, -0.1; P = .046). The sensitivity by patient gain was significant in all 
regions (+8.0% to +16.2%; P < .05) but shoulder and clavicle and spine (+4.2% 
and +2.6%; P = .12 and .52). Conclusion AI assistance improved the sensitivity 
and may even improve the specificity of fracture detection by radiologists and 
nonradiologists, without lengthening reading time. Published under a CC BY 4.0

Automated Hyperspectral 2D/3D Raman Analysis Using the Learner-Predictor 
Strategy: Machine Learning-Based Inline Raman Data Analytics.

Synchronously detecting multiple Raman spectral signatures in 
two-dimensional/three-dimensional (2D/3D) hyperspectral Raman analysis is a 
daunting challenge. The underlying reasons notwithstanding the enormous volume 
of the data and also the complexities involved in the end-to-end Raman analytics 
pipeline: baseline removal, cosmic noise elimination, and extraction of trusted 
spectral signatures and abundance maps. Elimination of cosmic noise is the 
bottleneck in the entire Raman analytics pipeline. Unless this issue is 
addressed, the realization of autonomous Raman analytics is impractical. Here, 
we present a learner-predictor strategy-based "automated hyperspectral Raman 
analysis framework" to rapidly fingerprint the molecular variations in the 
hyperspectral 2D/3D Raman dataset. We introduce the spectrum angle mapper (SAM) 
technique to eradicate the cosmic noise from the hyperspectral Raman dataset. 
The learner-predictor strategy eludes the necessity of human inference, and 
analytics can be done in autonomous mode. The learner owns the ability to learn; 
it automatically eliminates the baseline and cosmic noise from the Raman 
dataset, extracts the predominant spectral signatures, and renders the 
respective abundance maps. In a nutshell, the learner precisely learned the 
spectral features space during the hyperspectral Raman analysis. Afterward, the 
learned spectral features space was translated into a neural network (LNN) 
model. In the predictor, machine-learned intelligence (LNN) is utilized to 
predict the alternate batch specimen's abundance maps in real time. The 
qualitative/quantitative evaluation of abundance maps implicitly lays the 
foundation for monitoring the offline/inline industrial qualitative/quantitative 
quality control (QA/QC) process. The present strategy is best suited for 
2D/3D/four-dimensional (4D) hyperspectral Raman spectroscopic techniques. The 
proposed ML framework is intuitive because it obviates human intelligence, 
sophisticated computational hardware, and solely a personal computer is enough 
for the end-to-end pipeline.

Machine learning (ML), as a branch of artificial intelligence, acquires the 
potential and meaningful rules from the mass of data via diverse algorithms. 
Owing to all research of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) belonging to the 
digitalization of clinical records or experimental works, a massive and complex 
amount of data has become an inextricable part of the related studies. It is 
thus not surprising that ML approaches, as novel and efficient tools to mine the 
useful knowledge from data, have created inroads in a diversity of scopes of TCM 
over the past decade of years. However, by browsing lots of literature, we find 
that not all of the ML approaches perform well in the same field. Upon further 
consideration, we infer that the specificity may inhere between the ML 
approaches and their applied fields. This systematic review focuses its 
attention on the four categories of ML approaches and their eight application 
scopes in TCM. According to the function, ML approaches are classified into four 
categories, including classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality 
reduction, and into 14 models as follows in more detail: support vector machine, 
least square-support vector machine, logistic regression, partial least squares 
regression, k-means clustering, hierarchical cluster analysis, artificial neural 
network, back propagation neural network, convolutional neural network, decision 
tree, random forest, principal component analysis, partial least 
squares-discriminant analysis, and orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant 
analysis. The eight common applied fields are divided into two parts: one for 
TCM, such as the diagnosis of diseases, the determination of syndromes, and the 
analysis of prescription, and the other for the related researches of Chinese 
herbal medicine, such as the quality control, the identification of geographic 
origins, the pharmacodynamic material basis, the medicinal properties, and the 
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Additionally, this paper discusses the 
function and feature difference among ML approaches when they are applied to the 
corresponding fields via comparing their principles. The specificity of each 
approach to its applied fields has also been affirmed, whereby laying a 
foundation for subsequent studies applying ML approaches to TCM.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We re-evaluated clinical applications of image-to-FE models 
to understand if clinical advantages are already evident, which proposals are 
promising, and which questions are still open.
RECENT FINDINGS: CT-to-FE is useful in longitudinal treatment evaluation and 
groups discrimination. In metastatic lesions, CT-to-FE strength alone accurately 
predicts impending femoral fractures. In osteoporosis, strength from CT-to-FE or 
DXA-to-FE predicts incident fractures similarly to DXA-aBMD. Coupling loads and 
strength (possibly in dynamic models) may improve prediction. One promising 
MRI-to-FE workflow may now be tested on clinical data. Evidence of artificial 
intelligence usefulness is appearing. CT-to-FE is already clinical in 
opportunistic CT screening for osteoporosis, and risk of metastasis-related 
impending fractures. Short-term keys to improve image-to-FE in osteoporosis may 
be coupling FE with fall risk estimates, pool FE results with other parameters 
through robust artificial intelligence approaches, and increase reproducibility 
and cross-validation of models. Modeling bone modifications over time and bone 
fracture mechanics are still open issues.

With the continuous deepening of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) research, ANN 
model structure and function are improving towards diversification and 
intelligence. However, the model is more evaluated from the pros and cons of the 
problem-solving results and the lack of evaluation from the biomimetic aspect of 
imitating neural networks is not inclusive enough. Hence, a new ANN models 
evaluation strategy is proposed from the perspective of bionics in response to 
this problem in the paper. Firstly, four classical neural network models are 
illustrated: Back Propagation (BP) network, Deep Belief Network (DBN), LeNet5 
network, and olfactory bionic model (KIII model), and the neuron transmission 
mode and equation, network structure, and weight updating principle of the 
models are analyzed qualitatively. The analysis results show that the KIII model 
comes closer to the actual biological nervous system compared with other models, 
and the LeNet5 network simulates the nervous system in depth. Secondly, 
evaluation indexes of ANN are constructed from the perspective of bionics in 
this paper: small-world, synchronous, and chaotic characteristics. Finally, the 
network model is quantitatively analyzed by evaluation indexes from the 
perspective of bionics. The experimental results show that the DBN network, 
LeNet5 network, and BP network have synchronous characteristics. And the DBN 
network and LeNet5 network have certain chaotic characteristics, but there is 
still a certain distance between the three classical neural networks and actual 
biological neural networks. The KIII model has certain small-world 
characteristics in structure, and its network also exhibits synchronization 
characteristics and chaotic characteristics. Compared with the DBN network, 
LeNet5 network, and the BP network, the KIII model is closer to the real 
biological neural network.

Secondary pulmonary tuberculosis (SPT) is one of the top ten causes of death 
from a single infectious agent. To recognize SPT more accurately, this paper 
proposes a novel artificial intelligence model, which uses Pseudo Zernike moment 
(PZM) as the feature extractor and deep stacked sparse autoencoder (DSSAE) as 
the classifier. In addition, 18-way data augmentation is employed to avoid 
overfitting. This model is abbreviated as PZM-DSSAE. The ten runs of 10-fold 
cross-validation show this model achieves a sensitivity of 93.33% ± 1.47%, a 
specificity of 93.13% ± 0.95%, a precision of 93.15% ± 0.89%, an accuracy of 
93.23% ± 0.81%, and an F1 score of 93.23% ± 0.83%. The area-under-curve reaches 
0.9739. This PZM-DSSAE is superior to 5 state-of-the-art approaches.

Bacterial keratitis (BK), a painful and fulminant bacterial infection of the 
cornea, is the most common type of vision-threatening infectious keratitis (IK). 
A rapid clinical diagnosis by an ophthalmologist may often help prevent BK 
patients from progression to corneal melting or even perforation, but many rural 
areas cannot afford an ophthalmologist. Thanks to the rapid development of deep 
learning (DL) algorithms, artificial intelligence via image could provide an 
immediate screening and recommendation for patients with red and painful eyes. 
Therefore, this study aims to elucidate the potentials of different DL 
algorithms for diagnosing BK via external eye photos. External eye photos of 
clinically suspected IK were consecutively collected from five referral centers. 
The candidate DL frameworks, including ResNet50, ResNeXt50, DenseNet121, 
SE-ResNet50, EfficientNets B0, B1, B2, and B3, were trained to recognize BK from 
the photo toward the target with the greatest area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUROC). Via five-cross validation, EfficientNet B3 showed 
the most excellent average AUROC, in which the average percentage of 
sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive 
value was 74, 64, 77, and 61. There was no statistical difference in diagnostic 
accuracy and AUROC between any two of these DL frameworks. The diagnostic 
accuracy of these models (ranged from 69 to 72%) is comparable to that of the 
ophthalmologist (66% to 74%). Therefore, all these models are promising tools 
for diagnosing BK in first-line medical care units without ophthalmologists.

OBJECTIVES: Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms have been developed to 
detect imaging features on chest X-ray (CXR) with a comprehensive AI model 
capable of detecting 124 CXR findings being recently developed. The aim of this 
study was to evaluate the real-world usefulness of the model as a diagnostic 
assistance device for radiologists.
DESIGN: This prospective real-world multicentre study involved a group of 
radiologists using the model in their daily reporting workflow to report 
consecutive CXRs and recording their feedback on level of agreement with the 
model findings and whether this significantly affected their reporting.
SETTING: The study took place at radiology clinics and hospitals within a large 
radiology network in Australia between November and December 2020.
PARTICIPANTS: Eleven consultant diagnostic radiologists of varying levels of 
experience participated in this study.
PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion of CXR cases where use of the 
AI model led to significant material changes to the radiologist report, to 
patient management, or to imaging recommendations. Additionally, level of 
agreement between radiologists and the model findings, and radiologist attitudes 
towards the model were assessed.
RESULTS: Of 2972 cases reviewed with the model, 92 cases (3.1%) had significant 
report changes, 43 cases (1.4%) had changed patient management and 29 cases 
(1.0%) had further imaging recommendations. In terms of agreement with the 
model, 2569 cases showed complete agreement (86.5%). 390 (13%) cases had one or 
more findings rejected by the radiologist. There were 16 findings across 13 
cases (0.5%) deemed to be missed by the model. Nine out of 10 radiologists felt 
their accuracy was improved with the model and were more positive towards AI 
poststudy.
CONCLUSIONS: Use of an AI model in a real-world reporting environment 
significantly improved radiologist reporting and showed good agreement with 
radiologists, highlighting the potential for AI diagnostic support to improve 
clinical practice.

BACKGROUND: Fabry disease (FD) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by 
glycosphingolipid accumulation and progressive damage across multiple organ 
systems. Due to its heterogeneous presentation, the condition is likely 
significantly underdiagnosed. Several approaches, including provider education 
efforts and newborn screening, have attempted to address underdiagnosis of FD 
across the age spectrum, with limited success. Artificial intelligence (AI) 
methods present another option for improving diagnosis. These methods isolate 
common health history patterns among patients using longitudinal real-world 
data, and can be particularly useful when patients experience nonspecific, 
heterogeneous symptoms over time. In this study, the performance of an AI tool 
in identifying patients with FD was analyzed. The tool was calibrated using 
de-identified health record data from a large cohort of nearly 5000 FD patients, 
and extracted phenotypic patterns from these records. The tool then used this FD 
pattern information to make individual-level estimates of FD in a testing 
dataset. Patterns were reviewed and confirmed with medical experts.
RESULTS: The AI tool demonstrated strong analytic performance in identifying FD 
patients. In out-of-sample testing, it achieved an area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.82. Strong performance was 
maintained when testing on male-only and female-only cohorts, with AUROCs of 
0.83 and 0.82 respectively. The tool identified small segments of the population 
with greatly increased prevalence of FD: in the 1% of the population identified 
by the tool as at highest risk, FD was 23.9 times more prevalent than in the 
population overall. The AI algorithm used hundreds of phenotypic signals to make 
predictions and included both familiar symptoms associated with FD (e.g. renal 
manifestations) as well as less well-studied characteristics.
CONCLUSIONS: The AI tool analyzed in this study performed very well in 
identifying Fabry disease patients using structured medical history data. 
Performance was maintained in all-male and all-female cohorts, and the 
phenotypic manifestations of FD highlighted by the tool were reviewed and 
confirmed by clinical experts in the condition. The platform's analytic 
performance, transparency, and ability to generate predictions based on existing 
real-world health data may allow it to contribute to reducing persistent 
underdiagnosis of Fabry disease.

BACKGROUND: The launch in 2017 of the Irish 10-year reform programme Sláintecare 
represents a key commitment in the future of the health system. An important 
component of the programme was the development of a health system performance 
assessment (HSPA) framework. In 2019, the Department of Health of Ireland (DoH) 
and Health Service Executive (HSE) commissioned the technical support of 
researchers to develop an outcome-oriented HSPA framework which should reflect 
the shared priorities of multiple stakeholders, including citizens. This study 
describes the method applied in the Irish context and reflects on the added 
value of using a citizen panel in the development of an HSPA framework.
METHODS: A panel of 15 citizens was convened, recruited by a third-party company 
using a sampling strategy to achieve a balanced mix representing the Irish 
society. Panellists received lay-language preparatory materials before the 
meeting. Panellists used a three-colour scheme to signal the importance of 
performance measures. An exit questionnaire was administered to understand how 
participants experienced being part of the panel. The citizen panel was the 
first in a series of three panels towards the development of the HSPA framework, 
followed by panels including representatives of the DoH and HSE, and 
representatives from professional associations and special interest groups.
RESULTS: The citizen panel generated 249 health performance measures ranging 
across 13 domains. Top-ranking domains to the citizen panel (people-centredness, 
coordination of care, and coverage) were less prioritized by the other panels; 
domains less prioritized by the citizen panel, such as accessibility, 
responsiveness, efficiency, and effectiveness, were of higher priority in the 
other panels. Citizen panellists shared a similar understanding of what a 
citizen panel involves and described their experience at the panel as enjoyable, 
interesting, and informative.
CONCLUSIONS: The priorities of the citizen panel were accounted for during all 
phases of developing the HSPA framework. This was possible by adopting an 
inclusive development process and by engaging citizens early on. Citizen 
engagement in HSPA development is essential for realizing citizen-driven 
healthcare system performance and generating trust and ownership in performance 
intelligence. Future research could expand the use of citizen panels to assess, 
monitor, and report on the performance of healthcare systems.

BACKGROUND: Systematic reviews are the cornerstone of evidence-based medicine. 
However, systematic reviews are time consuming and there is growing demand to 
produce evidence more quickly, while maintaining robust methods. In recent 
years, artificial intelligence and active-machine learning (AML) have been 
implemented into several SR software applications. As some of the barriers to 
adoption of new technologies are the challenges in set-up and how best to use 
these technologies, we have provided different situations and considerations for 
knowledge synthesis teams to consider when using artificial intelligence and AML 
for title and abstract screening.
METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the implementation and performance of AML 
across a set of ten historically completed systematic reviews. Based upon the 
findings from this work and in consideration of the barriers we have encountered 
and navigated during the past 24 months in using these tools prospectively in 
our research, we discussed and developed a series of practical recommendations 
for research teams to consider in seeking to implement AML tools for citation 
screening into their workflow.
RESULTS: We developed a seven-step framework and provide guidance for when and 
how to integrate artificial intelligence and AML into the title and abstract 
screening process. Steps include: (1) Consulting with Knowledge user/Expert 
Panel; (2) Developing the search strategy; (3) Preparing your review team; (4) 
Preparing your database; (5) Building the initial training set; (6) Ongoing 
screening; and (7) Truncating screening. During Step 6 and/or 7, you may also 
choose to optimize your team, by shifting some members to other review stages 
(e.g., full-text screening, data extraction).
CONCLUSION: Artificial intelligence and, more specifically, AML are 
well-developed tools for title and abstract screening and can be integrated into 
the screening process in several ways. Regardless of the method chosen, 
transparent reporting of these methods is critical for future studies evaluating 
artificial intelligence and AML.

How did grammar evolve? Perhaps a better way to ask the question is what kind of 
cognition is needed to enable grammar. The present analysis departs from the 
observation that linguistic communication is structured in terms of agents and 
patients, a reflection of how humans see the world. One way to explore the 
origins of cognitive skills in humans is to compare them with primates. A first 
approach has been to teach great apes linguistic systems to study their 
production in subsequent conversations. This literature has revealed 
considerable semantic competences in great apes, but no evidence for a 
corresponding grammatical ability, at least in production. No ape has ever 
created a sentence with an underlying causal structure of agency and 
patienthood. A second approach has been to study natural communication in 
primates and other animals. Here, there is intermittent evidence of 
compositionality, for example, a capacity to perform operations on semantic 
units, but again no evidence for an ability to refer to the causal structure of 
events. Future research will have to decide whether primates and other animals 
are simply unable to see the world as casually structured the way humans do, or 
whether they are just unable to communicate causal structures to others. This 
article is categorized under: Cognitive Biology > Evolutionary Roots of 
Cognition Computer Science and Robotics > Artificial Intelligence Linguistics > 
Evolution of Language.

INTRODUCTION: Signal-averaged electrocardiography is a non-invasive, 
computerized technique that amplifies, filters, and averages cardiac electrical 
signals reducing contaminating noise to obtain a high-resolution record. The 
most widely used signal averaging (SA) method involves a bipolar X, Y, and Z 
orthogonal lead system. Information is limited regarding its application in the 
standard resting 12-lead ECG. A novel system combining a high-resolution 12-lead 
ECG (HR-ECG) registered by SA with advanced analysis tools is presented.
HISTORY: Original programming of a commercially available signal-averaged HR-ECG 
device was modified, introducing more exhaustive electrocardiographic assessment 
instruments.
DESCRIPTION: Using SA techniques and placing surface electrodes in the standard 
12-lead ECG positions, a HR-ECG is acquired within a bandwidth of 0.25 to 262 Hz 
at a rate of 1000 samples per second. It is advisable to average at least 
200 cycles, taking three to five minutes to record. The package includes 
different optional high-frequency filters, manual calipers, 
zoom/superimposing/amplification functions.
CLINICAL ROLE: The main strength lies in obtaining a low noise HR-ECG with 
zooming capabilities without definition loss. Other potential advantages are the 
greater ease in performing high precision analysis and comparing different ECG 
leads simultaneously.
CURRENT PROBLEMS: The primary limitation is the inability to document 
intermittent or dynamic electrocardiographic disorders because of averaging 
similar electrical cardiac cycles.
FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS: Adding artificial intelligence and further refinements in 
the averaging process could lead to software upgrades.
CONCLUSION: Integrating HR-ECG, obtained through SA techniques, with novel 
advanced analysis tools can enhance the ability to detect electrocardiographic 
disorders of permanent expression expeditiously.

PURPOSE: We have utilized different methods in machine learning (ML) to develop 
the best algorithm to differentiate comorbid functional seizures (FS) and 
epilepsy from those who have pure FS.
METHODS: This was a retrospective study of an electronic database of patients 
with seizures. All patients with a diagnosis of FS (with or without comorbid 
epilepsy) were studied at the outpatient epilepsy clinic at Shiraz University of 
Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran, from 2008 until 2021. We arbitrarily selected 14 
features that are important in making the diagnosis of patients with seizures 
and also are easily obtainable during history taking. Pytorch and Scikit-learn 
packages were used to construct various models including random forest 
classifier, decision tree classifier, support vector classifier, k-nearest 
neighbor, and TabNet classifier.
RESULTS: Three hundred and two patients had FS (82.5%), while 64 patients had FS 
and comorbid epilepsy (17.5%). The "TabNet classifier" could provide the best 
sensitivity (90%) and specificity (74%) measures (accuracy of 76%) to help 
differentiate patients with FS from those with FS and comorbid epilepsy.
CONCLUSION: These satisfactory differentiating measures suggest that the current 
algorithm could be used in clinical practice to help with the difficult task of 
distinguishing patients with FS from those with FS and comorbid epilepsy. Based 
on the results of the current study, we have developed an Application (SeiDx).

Since December 2019, the COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in countless deaths and 
has harmed all facets of human existence. COVID-19 has been designated an 
epidemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), which has placed a tremendous 
burden on nearly all countries, especially those with weak health systems. 
However, Deep Learning (DL) has been applied in several applications and many 
types of detection applications in the medical field, including thyroid 
diagnosis, lung nodule recognition, fetal localization, and detection of 
diabetic retinopathy. Furthermore, various clinical imaging sources, like 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), X-ray, and Computed Tomography (CT), make DL a 
perfect technique to tackle the epidemic of COVID-19. Inspired by this fact, a 
considerable amount of research has been done. A Systematic Literature Review 
(SLR) has been used in this study to discover, assess, and integrate findings 
from relevant studies. DL techniques used in COVID-19 have also been categorized 
into seven main distinct categories as Long Short Term Memory Networks (LSTM), 
Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), Conventional Neural Networks (CNNs), Generative 
Adversarial Networks (GANs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Autoencoders, and 
hybrid approaches. Then, the state-of-the-art studies connected to DL techniques 
and applications for health problems with COVID-19 have been highlighted. 
Moreover, many issues and problems associated with DL implementation for 
COVID-19 have been addressed, which are anticipated to stimulate more 
investigations to control the prevalence and disaster control in the future. 
According to the findings, most papers are assessed using characteristics such 
as accuracy, delay, robustness, and scalability. Meanwhile, other features are 
underutilized, such as security and convergence time. Python is also the most 
commonly used language in papers, accounting for 75% of the time. According to 
the investigation, 37.83% of applications have identified chest CT/chest X-ray 
images for patients.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Adenoma detection rate is the crucial parameter for 
colorectal cancer screening. Increasing the field of view with additional side 
optics has been reported to detect flat adenomas hidden behind folds. 
Furthermore, artificial intelligence (AI) has also recently been introduced to 
detect more adenomas. We therefore aimed to combine both technologies in a new 
prototypic colonoscopy concept.
METHODS: A 3-dimensional-printed cap including 2 microcameras was attached to a 
conventional endoscope. The prototype was applied in 8 gene-targeted pigs with 
mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli gene. The first 4 animals were used 
to train an AI system based on the images generated by microcameras. Thereafter, 
the conceptual prototype for detecting adenomas was tested in a further series 
of 4 pigs.
RESULTS: Using our prototype, we detected, with side optics, adenomas that might 
have been missed conventionally. Furthermore, the newly developed AI could 
detect, mark, and present adenomas visualized with side optics outside of the 
conventional field of view.
CONCLUSIONS: Combining AI with side optics might help detect adenomas that 
otherwise might have been missed.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize society by 
automating tasks as diverse as driving cars, diagnosing diseases, and providing 
legal advice. The degree to which AI can improve outcomes in these and other 
domains depends on how comfortable people are trusting AI for these tasks, which 
in turn depends on lay perceptions of AI. The present research examines how 
these critical lay perceptions may vary as a function of conservatism. Using 
five survey experiments, we find that political conservatism is associated with 
low comfort with and trust in AI-i.e., with AI aversion. This relationship 
between conservatism and AI aversion is explained by the link between 
conservatism and risk perception; more conservative individuals perceive AI as 
being riskier and are therefore more averse to its adoption. Finally, we test 
whether a moral reframing intervention can reduce AI aversion among 
conservatives.

Protecting patients' privacy is one of the most important tasks when developing 
medical artificial intelligence models since medical data is the most sensitive 
personal data. To overcome this privacy protection issue, diverse 
privacy-preserving methods have been proposed. We proposed a novel method for 
privacy-preserving Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) inference model using privacy 
enhancing technologies including homomorphic encryption and secure two party 
computation. The proposed privacy-preserving GRU inference model validated on 
breast cancer recurrence prediction with 13,117 patients' medical data. Our 
method gives reliable prediction result (0.893 accuracy) compared to the normal 
GRU model (0.895 accuracy). Unlike other previous works, the experiment on real 
breast cancer data yields almost identical results for privacy-preserving and 
conventional cases. We also implement our algorithm to shows the realistic 
end-to-end encrypted breast cancer recurrence prediction.

Cognitive reflection and authoritarianism relate to how parents respond to 
children's science questions.

When children ask questions about science, parents use a variety of strategies 
to answer them, including providing accurate information, connecting to prior 
knowledge, or simply saying "I do not know." This study examines the factors 
underlying individual differences in parental explanatory characteristics. 
Parents (N = 148; Mage = 38; 84% female, 16% male; 58% with White American 
children; 67% having completed college; 49% with household income over $75,000) 
of children ages 7 to 10 answered eight questions about biology as if they were 
responding to their child. They also completed three measures of different 
aspects of reasoning and values: the Picture Vocabulary Test (PVT) to measure 
verbal intelligence (Gershon et al., 2013), the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT; 
Toplak et al., 2014), which measures the tendency to override intuitive but 
incorrect responses to engage in reflective thinking, and the Authoritarianism 
Scale (Feldman & Stenner, 1997), which measures a parent's preference for 
encouraging obedience toward authority figures over encouraging their child's 
autonomy. Our findings support that different factors are associated with 
different explanatory characteristics. Parents high in reflective thinking tend 
to provide more connections to other knowledge in their explanations, while 
parents high in authoritarianism tend to provide fewer references to uncertainty 
and how to manage it. Implications for effective parent-child communication and 
children's scientific understanding will be discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the impact of computed tomography (CT)-based, 
artificial intelligence-driven waist skeletal muscle volume on survival outcomes 
in patients with endometrial cancer.
METHODS: We retrospectively identified endometrial cancer patients who received 
primary surgical treatment between 2014 and 2018 and whose pre-treatment CT 
scans were available (n = 385). Using an artificial intelligence-based tool, the 
skeletal muscle area (cm2) at the third lumbar vertebra (L3) and the skeletal 
muscle volume (cm3) at the waist level were measured. These values were 
converted to the L3 skeletal muscle index (SMI) and volumetric SMI by 
normalisation with body height. The relationships between L3, volumetric SMIs, 
and survival outcomes were evaluated.
RESULTS: Setting 39.0 cm2/m2 of L3 SMI as cut-off value for sarcopenia, 
sarcopenia (< 39.0 cm2/m2, n = 177) and non-sarcopenia (≥ 39.0 cm2/m2, n = 208) 
groups showed similar progression-free survival (PFS; p = 0.335) and overall 
survival (OS; p = 0.241). Using the median value, the low-volumetric SMI group 
(< 206.0 cm3/m3, n = 192) showed significantly worse PFS (3-year survival rate, 
77.3% vs. 88.8%; p = 0.004) and OS (3-year survival rate, 92.8% vs. 99.4%; 
p = 0.003) than the high-volumetric SMI group (≥ 206.0 cm3/m3, n = 193). In 
multivariate analyses adjusted for baseline body mass index and other factors, 
low-volumetric SMI was identified as an independent poor prognostic factor for 
PFS (adjusted HR, 1.762; 95% CI, 1.051-2.953; p = 0.032) and OS (adjusted HR, 
5.964; 95% CI, 1.296-27.448; p = 0.022).
CONCLUSIONS: Waist skeletal muscle volume might be a novel prognostic biomarker 
in patients with endometrial cancer. Assessing body composition before treatment 
can provide important prognostic information for such patients.

AI is a broad concept, grouping initiatives that use a computer to perform tasks 
that would usually require a human to complete. AI methods are well suited to 
predict clinical outcomes. In practice, AI methods can be thought of as 
functions that learn the outcomes accompanying standardized input data to 
produce accurate outcome predictions when trialed with new data. Current methods 
for cleaning, creating, accessing, extracting, augmenting, and representing data 
for training AI clinical prediction models are well defined. The use of AI to 
predict clinical outcomes is a dynamic and rapidly evolving arena, with new 
methods and applications emerging. Extraction or accession of electronic health 
care records and combining these with patient genetic data is an area of present 
attention, with tremendous potential for future growth. Machine learning 
approaches, including decision tree methods of Random Forest and XGBoost, and 
deep learning techniques including deep multi-layer and recurrent neural 
networks, afford unique capabilities to accurately create predictions from high 
dimensional, multimodal data. Furthermore, AI methods are increasing our ability 
to accurately predict clinical outcomes that previously were difficult to model, 
including time-dependent and multi-class outcomes. Barriers to robust AI-based 
clinical outcome model deployment include changing AI product development 
interfaces, the specificity of regulation requirements, and limitations in 
ensuring model interpretability, generalizability, and adaptability over time.

BACKGROUND: Cardiac arrest is a life-threatening cessation of activity in the 
heart. Early prediction of cardiac arrest is important, as it allows for the 
necessary measures to be taken to prevent or intervene during the onset. 
Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and big data have been increasingly 
used to enhance the ability to predict and prepare for the patients at risk.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the use of AI technology in predicting 
cardiac arrest as reported in the literature.
METHODS: A scoping review was conducted in line with the guidelines of the 
PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) 
extension for scoping reviews. Scopus, ScienceDirect, Embase, the Institute of 
Electrical and Electronics Engineers, and Google Scholar were searched to 
identify relevant studies. Backward reference list checks of the included 
studies were also conducted. Study selection and data extraction were 
independently conducted by 2 reviewers. Data extracted from the included studies 
were synthesized narratively.
RESULTS: Out of 697 citations retrieved, 41 studies were included in the review, 
and 6 were added after backward citation checking. The included studies reported 
the use of AI in the prediction of cardiac arrest. Of the 47 studies, we were 
able to classify the approaches taken by the studies into 3 different 
categories: 26 (55%) studies predicted cardiac arrest by analyzing specific 
parameters or variables of the patients, whereas 16 (34%) studies developed an 
AI-based warning system. The remaining 11% (5/47) of studies focused on 
distinguishing patients at high risk of cardiac arrest from patients who were 
not at risk. Two studies focused on the pediatric population, and the rest 
focused on adults (45/47, 96%). Most of the studies used data sets with a size 
of <10,000 samples (32/47, 68%). Machine learning models were the most prominent 
branch of AI used in the prediction of cardiac arrest in the studies (38/47, 
81%), and the most used algorithm was the neural network (23/47, 49%). K-fold 
cross-validation was the most used algorithm evaluation tool reported in the 
studies (24/47, 51%).
CONCLUSIONS: AI is extensively used to predict cardiac arrest in different 
patient settings. Technology is expected to play an integral role in improving 
cardiac medicine. There is a need for more reviews to learn the obstacles to the 
implementation of AI technologies in clinical settings. Moreover, research 
focusing on how to best provide clinicians with support to understand, adapt, 
and implement this technology in their practice is also necessary.

BACKGROUND: Emotional intelligence (EI) and assertiveness are key abilities for 
physiotherapists. Clinical placements seem to affect students' development of EI 
and assertiveness, and their construction of the professional role.
PURPOSE: This study aims to compare the EI of physiotherapy students with 
students from other health professions and explore the evolution of EI and 
assertiveness in physiotherapy students throughout their university education, 
focusing on the influence of clinical practice.
METHOD: Students (N = 753) completed a self-administered questionnaire to 
measure emotional intelligence (TMMS 24), assertiveness (CSES), and 
sociodemographic variables.
RESULTS: EI levels were adequate and very similar across the three disciplines. 
Regarding assertiveness, physiotherapy students in year 4 obtained significantly 
higher levels than students in years 1, 2, and 3. Significant correlations (rs 
(207) = 0.35, p < .001) were found between assertiveness and the number of 
modules of clinical practice.
CONCLUSION: This study contributes with further evidence on the improvement of 
assertiveness in physiotherapy students through their university education and, 
in particular, with clinical placements. Practical implications highlight the 
importance of training in EI and assertiveness during university, coupled with 
clinical placements, in order to prepare for an effective and satisfactory 
professional life.

The immunohistochemical method serves as one of the most practical tools in 
clinical cancer detection and thus has great application value to overcome the 
existing limits of the conventional method and further improve the detecting 
efficiency and sensitivity. This study employed 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB), a 
conventional color indicator for immunohistochemistry, as a novel high-sensitive 
scattering reagent to provide a multidimensional image signal varying with the 
overexpression rate of tumor markers. Based on the scattering properties of DAB 
aggregates, an efficient and robust artificial intelligence-aided 
immunohistochemical method based on dark-field imaging has been established, 
with improvement in both the imaging quality and interpretation efficiency in 
comparison with the conventional manual-operated immunohistochemical method. 
Referencing the diagnosis from three independent pathologists, this method 
succeeded in detecting HER2 overexpressed breast tumors with a sensitivity of 
95.2% and a specificity of 100.0%; meanwhile, it was found to be applicable for 
non-small-cell lung tumors and malignant lymphoma as well. As demonstrated, this 
study provided an effective and reliable means for making diagnostic 
suggestions, which exhibited great potential in multiple tumor pathological 
detection at low cost.

Promoters are one of the most critical regulatory elements controlling metabolic 
pathways. However, the fast and accurate prediction of promoter strength remains 
challenging, leading to time- and labor-consuming promoter construction and 
characterization processes. This dilemma is caused by the lack of a big promoter 
library that has gradient strengths, broad dynamic ranges, and clear sequence 
profiles that can be used to train an artificial intelligence model of promoter 
strength prediction. To overcome this challenge, we constructed and 
characterized a mutant library of Trc promoters (Ptrc) using 83 rounds of 
mutation-construction-screening-characterization engineering cycles. After 
excluding invalid mutation sites, we established a synthetic promoter library 
that consisted of 3665 different variants, displaying an intensity range of more 
than two orders of magnitude. The strongest variant was ∼69-fold stronger than 
the original Ptrc and 1.52-fold stronger than a 1 mM 
isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside-driven PT7 promoter, with an ∼454-fold difference 
between the strongest and weakest expression levels. Using this synthetic 
promoter library, different machine learning models were built and optimized to 
explore the relationships between promoter sequences and transcriptional 
strength. Finally, our XgBoost model exhibited optimal performance, and we 
utilized this approach to precisely predict the strength of artificially 
designed promoter sequences (R2 = 0.88, mean absolute error = 0.15, and Pearson 
correlation coefficient = 0.94). Our work provides a powerful platform that 
enables the predictable tuning of promoters to achieve optimal transcriptional 
strength.

As in other areas, artificial intelligence (AI) is heavily promoted in different 
scientific fields, including chemistry. Although chemistry traditionally tends 
to be a conservative field and slower than others to adapt new concepts, AI is 
increasingly being investigated across chemical disciplines. In medicinal 
chemistry, supported by computer-aided drug design and cheminformatics, 
computational methods have long been employed to aid in the search for and 
optimization of active compounds. We are currently witnessing a multitude of 
AI-related publications in the medicinal-chemistry-relevant literature and 
anticipate that the numbers will further increase. Often, advances through AI 
promoted in such reports are difficult to reconcile or remain questionable, 
which hampers the acceptance of computational work in interdisciplinary 
environments. Herein we attempt to highlight selected investigations in which AI 
has shown promise to impact medicinal chemistry in areas such as compound design 
and synthesis.

Built on the foundation of the randomized controlled trial (RCT), Evidence Based 
Medicine (EBM) is at its best when optimizing outcomes for homogeneous cohorts 
of patients like those participating in an RCT. Its weakness is a failure to 
resolve a clinical quandary: patients appear for care individually, each may 
differ in important ways from an RCT cohort, and the physician will wonder each 
time if following EBM will provide best guidance for this unique patient. In an 
effort to overcome this weakness, and promote higher quality care through a more 
personalized approach, a new framework has been proposed: Medicine-Based 
Evidence (MBE). In this approach, big data and deep learning techniques are 
embraced to interrogate treatment responses among patients in real-world 
clinical practice. Such statistical models are then integrated with mechanistic 
disease models to construct a "digital twin," which serves as the real-time 
digital counterpart of a patient. MBE is thereby capable of dynamically modeling 
the effects of various treatment decisions in the context of an individual's 
specific characteristics. In this article, we discuss how MBE could benefit 
patients with congenital heart disease, a field where RCTs are difficult to 
conduct and often fail to provide definitive solutions because of a small number 
of subjects, their clinical complexity, and heterogeneity. We will also 
highlight the challenges that must be addressed before MBE can be embraced in 
clinical practice and its full potential can be realized.

Objective: To assess the performance of a novel deep learning (DL)-based 
artificial intelligence (AI) system in classifying computed tomography (CT) 
scans of pneumonia patients into different groups, as well as to present an 
effective clinically relevant machine learning (ML) system based on medical 
image identification and clinical feature interpretation to assist radiologists 
in triage and diagnosis. Methods: The 3,463 CT images of pneumonia used in this 
multi-center retrospective study were divided into four categories: bacterial 
pneumonia (n = 507), fungal pneumonia (n = 126), common viral pneumonia (n = 
777), and COVID-19 (n = 2,053). We used DL methods based on images to 
distinguish pulmonary infections. A machine learning (ML) model for risk 
interpretation was developed using key imaging (learned from the DL methods) and 
clinical features. The algorithms were evaluated using the areas under the 
receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs). Results: The median AUC of DL 
models for differentiating pulmonary infection was 99.5% (COVID-19), 98.6% 
(viral pneumonia), 98.4% (bacterial pneumonia), 99.1% (fungal pneumonia), 
respectively. By combining chest CT results and clinical symptoms, the ML model 
performed well, with an AUC of 99.7% for SARS-CoV-2, 99.4% for common virus, 
98.9% for bacteria, and 99.6% for fungus. Regarding clinical features 
interpreting, the model revealed distinctive CT characteristics associated with 
specific pneumonia: in COVID-19, ground-glass opacity (GGO) [92.5%; odds ratio 
(OR), 1.76; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.71-1.86]; larger lesions in the 
right upper lung (75.0%; OR, 1.12; 95% CI: 1.03-1.25) with viral pneumonia; 
older age (57.0 years ± 14.2, OR, 1.84; 95% CI: 1.73-1.99) with bacterial 
pneumonia; and consolidation (95.8%, OR, 1.29; 95% CI: 1.05-1.40) with fungal 
pneumonia. Conclusion: For classifying common types of pneumonia and assessing 
the influential factors for triage, our AI system has shown promising results. 
Our ultimate goal is to assist clinicians in making quick and accurate 
diagnoses, resulting in the potential for early therapeutic intervention.

AIM: To assist with retinal vein occlusion (RVO) screening, artificial 
intelligence (AI) methods based on deep learning (DL) have been developed to 
alleviate the pressure experienced by ophthalmologists and discover and treat 
RVO as early as possible.
METHODS: A total of 8600 color fundus photographs (CFPs) were included for 
training, validation, and testing of disease recognition models and lesion 
segmentation models. Four disease recognition and four lesion segmentation 
models were established and compared. Finally, one disease recognition model and 
one lesion segmentation model were selected as superior. Additionally, 224 CFPs 
from 130 patients were included as an external test set to determine the 
abilities of the two selected models.
RESULTS: Using the Inception-v3 model for disease identification, the mean 
sensitivity, specificity, and F1 for the three disease types and normal CFPs 
were 0.93, 0.99, and 0.95, respectively, and the mean area under the curve (AUC) 
was 0.99. Using the DeepLab-v3 model for lesion segmentation, the mean 
sensitivity, specificity, and F1 for four lesion types (abnormally dilated and 
tortuous blood vessels, cotton-wool spots, flame-shaped hemorrhages, and hard 
exudates) were 0.74, 0.97, and 0.83, respectively.
CONCLUSION: DL models show good performance when recognizing RVO and identifying 
lesions using CFPs. Because of the increasing number of RVO patients and 
increasing demand for trained ophthalmologists, DL models will be helpful for 
diagnosing RVO early in life and reducing vision impairment.

The Novel Corona Virus 2019 has drastically affected millions of people all 
around the world and was a huge threat to the human race since its evolution in 
2019. Chest CT images are considered to be one of the indicative sources for 
diagnosis of COVID-19 by most of the researchers in the research community. 
Several researchers have proposed various models for the prediction of COVID-19 
using CT images using Artificial Intelligence based algorithms (Alimadadi e al., 
2020 [19], Srinivasa Rao and Vazquez, 2020 [20], Vaishya et al., 2020 [21]). 
EfficientNet is one of the powerful Convolutional Neural Network models proposed 
by Tan and Le (2019). The objective of this study is to explore the effect of 
image enhancement algorithms such as Laplace transform, Wavelet transforms, 
Adaptive gamma correction and Contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization 
(CLAHE) on Chest CT images for the classification of Covid-19 using the 
EfficientNet algorithm. SARS- COV-2 (Soares et al., 2020) dataset is used in 
this study. The images were preprocessed and brightness augmented. The 
EfficientNet algorithm is implemented and the performance is evaluated by adding 
the four image enhancement algorithms. The CLAHE based EfficientNet model 
yielded an accuracy of 94.56%, precision of 95%, recall of 91%, and F1 of 93%. 
This study shows that adding a CLAHE image enhancement to the EfficientNet model 
improves the performance of the powerful Convolutional Neural Network model in 
classifying the CT images for Covid-19.

Oil production forecasting is an important task to manage petroleum reservoirs 
operations. In this study, a developed time series forecasting model is proposed 
for oil production using a new improved version of the adaptive neuro-fuzzy 
inference system (ANFIS). This model is improved by using an optimization 
algorithm, the slime mould algorithm (SMA). The SMA is a new algorithm that is 
applied for solving different optimization tasks. However, its search mechanism 
suffers from some limitations, for example, trapping at local optima. Thus, we 
modify the SMA using an intelligence search technique called opposition-based 
learning (OLB). The developed model, ANFIS-SMAOLB, is evaluated with different 
real-world oil production data collected from two oilfields in two different 
countries, Masila oilfield (Yemen) and Tahe oilfield (China). Furthermore, the 
evaluation of this model is considered with extensive comparisons to several 
methods, using several evaluation measures. The outcomes assessed the high 
ability of the developed ANFIS-SMAOLB as an efficient time series forecasting 
model that showed significant performance.

Robots equipped with artificial intelligence pose a huge challenge to 
traditional ontological differentiations between the spheres of the human and 
the non-human. Drawing mainly from neo-animistic and perspectivist approaches in 
anthropology and science and technology studies, the paper explores the 
potential of new forms of interconnectedness and rhizomatic entanglements 
between humans and a world transcending the boundaries between species and 
material spheres. We argue that intelligent robots meet virtually all criteria 
Western biology came up with to define 'life' and that it ultimately makes sense 
to recognize them as a new species that is part of our social universe. 
Contrasting dualistic concepts of man and nature with a monistic approach, we 
show that traditional properties of life (agency, self-replication, etc.) may 
apply to artefacts and that, once we accept the idea that social relationships 
are ultimately open connections to matter of any kind, the seemingly strict 
boundaries between species and material spheres can no longer be sustained. 
Instead, we propose to include 'matter' and ideas into the sphere of the social 
as agents in their own right to form a relational ontology of multi-species 
assemblages (ROMA).

Network interaction has evolved into a grouping paradigm as civilization has 
progressed and artificial intelligence technology has advanced. This network 
group model has quickly extended communication space, improved communication 
content, and tailored to the demands of netizens. The fast growth of the network 
community on campus can assist students in meeting a variety of communication 
needs and serve as a vital platform for their studies and daily lives. It is 
investigated how to extract opinion material from comment text. A strategy for 
extracting opinion attitude words and network opinion characteristic words from 
a single comment text is offered at a finer level. The development of a 
semiautonomous domain emotion dictionary generating technique improves the 
accuracy of opinion and attitude word extraction. This paper proposes a 
window-constrained Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model that improves 
the accuracy of extracting network opinion feature words and ensures that 
network opinion feature words and opinion attitude words are synchronized by 
using the location information of opinion attitude words. The two-stage opinion 
leader mining approach and the linear threshold model based on user roles are 
the subjects of model simulation tests in this study. It is demonstrated that 
the two-stage opinion leader mining method suggested in this study can greatly 
reduce the running time while properly finding opinion leaders with stronger 
leadership by comparing the results with existing models. It also shows that the 
linear threshold model based on user roles proposed in this paper can 
effectively limit the total number of active users who are activated multiple 
times during the information diffusion process by distinguishing the effects of 
different user roles on the information diffusion process.

The artificial intelligence algorithm was used to analyze the characteristics of 
computed tomography (CT) images before and after interventional treatment of 
children's lymphangioma. Retrospective analysis was performed, and 30 children 
with lymphangioma from the hospital were recruited as the study subjects. The 
ultrasound-guided bleomycin interventional therapy was adopted and applied to CT 
scanning through convolutional neural network (CNN). The CT imaging-related 
indicators before and after interventional therapy were detected, and feature 
analysis was performed. In addition, the CNN algorithm was adopted to segment 
the image of the tumor was clearer and more accurate. At the same time, the Dice 
similarity coefficient (DSC) of the CNN algorithm was 0.9, which had a higher 
degree of agreement. In terms of clinical symptoms, the cured children's lesions 
disappeared, the skin surface returned to normal color, and the treatment was 
smooth. In the two cases with effective treatment, the cystic mass at the lesion 
site was significantly smaller, and the nodules disappeared. CT images before 
interventional therapy showed that lymphangiomas in children were more common in 
the neck. The cystic masses at all lesion sites varied in diameter and size, and 
most of them were similar to round and irregular, with uniform density 
distribution. The boundary was clear, the cyst was solid, and there were 
different degrees of compression and spread to the surrounding structure. Most 
of them were polycystic, and a few of them were single cystic. After 
interventional treatment, CT images showed that 27 cases of cured children's 
lymphangioma completely disappeared. Lymphangioma was significantly reduced in 
two children with effective treatment. Edema around the tumor also decreased 
significantly. Patients who did not respond to the treatment received 
interventional treatment again, and the tumors disappeared completely on CT 
imaging. No recurrence or new occurrence was found in three-month follow-up. The 
total effective rate of interventional therapy for lymphangioma in children was 
96.67%. The CNN algorithm can effectively compare the CT image features before 
and after interventional treatment for children's lymphangioma. It was suggested 
that the artificial intelligence algorithm-aided CT imaging examination was 
helpful to guide physicians in the accurate treatment of children's 
lymphangioma.

The way by which artificial intelligence is implemented is similar to the 
thinking process of the human brain. People obtain information about external 
conditions through five senses, namely, vision, hearing, smell, taste, and 
touch, and, through the further processing of the brain, it forms meaningful 
decision-making elements. Then, through the process of analysis and reasoning, 
further decisions are made. In the information age, the application of 
intelligent management information systems in various fields has promoted the 
modernization and intelligence of social development. From the perspective of 
intelligent decision-making, this paper analyzes the requirements of intelligent 
information systems and designs an intelligent information system based on 
mobile Internet management optimization, including system management 
optimization, and proposes an environment-based layer, network transport layer, 
and the three-tier system architecture of the smart service application layer. 
Finally, this paper considers the problem of data fusion after system expansion. 
According to the existing fuzzy fusion algorithm, a weight-based fuzzy fusion 
algorithm is proposed. The simulation analysis shows that the algorithm can be 
effectively applied in intelligent information systems.

The differential evolution algorithm (DEA)-based iterative sliding mode control 
(ISMC) method was proposed for the path tracking problem of 
three-degree-of-freedom (3-DoF) underactuated ships under external interference, 
with the nonlinear separate model proposed by mathematical model group (MMG). To 
improve control quality and enhance robustness of the control system, a swarm 
intelligence optimization algorithm is used to design a controller parameter 
optimization system. The DEA was adopted in the system to solve the minimum 
system evaluation index function, and the optimal controller parameters are 
acquired. Considering the impact of chattering on the actual project, a 
chattering measurement function is defined in the controller design and used as 
an input of the controller parameter optimization system. Finally, the 5446TEU 
container ship is carried out for simulation. It is verified that the designed 
controller with strong robustness can effectively deal with the disturbances; 
meanwhile, the chattering of the output is significantly reduced, and the 
control rudder angle signal conforms to the actual operation requirements of the 
ship and is more in line with the engineering reality.

In recent years, deep learning, as a very popular artificial intelligence 
method, can be said to be a small area in the field of image recognition. It is 
a type of machine learning, actually derived from artificial neural networks, 
and is a method used to learn the characteristics of sample data. It is a 
multilayer network, which can learn the information from the bottom to the top 
of the image through the multilayer network, so as to extract the 
characteristics of the sample, and then perform identification and 
classification. The purpose of deep learning is to make the machine have the 
same analytical and learning capabilities as the human brain. The ability of 
deep learning in data processing (including images) is unmatched by other 
methods, and its achievements in recent years have left other methods behind. 
This article comprehensively reviews the application research progress of deep 
convolutional neural networks in ancient Chinese pattern restoration and mainly 
focuses on the research based on deep convolutional neural networks. The main 
tasks are as follows: (1) a detailed and comprehensive introduction to the basic 
knowledge of deep convolutional neural and a summary of related algorithms along 
the three directions of text preprocessing, learning, and neural networks are 
provided. This article focuses on the related mechanism of traditional pattern 
repair based on deep convolutional neural network and analyzes the key structure 
and principle. (2) Research on image restoration models based on deep 
convolutional networks and adversarial neural networks is carried out. The model 
is mainly composed of four parts, namely, information masking, feature 
extraction, generating network, and discriminant network. The main functions of 
each part are independent and interdependent. (3) The method based on the deep 
convolutional neural network and the other two methods are tested on the same 
part of the Qinghai traditional embroidery image data set. From the final 
evaluation index of the experiment, the method in this paper has better 
evaluation index than the traditional image restoration method based on samples 
and the image restoration method based on deep learning. In addition, from the 
actual image restoration effect, the method in this paper has a better image 
restoration effect than the other two methods, and the restoration results 
produced are more in line with the habit of human observation with the naked 
eye.

Background: There are no obvious clinical signs and symptoms in the early stages 
of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and most patients usually have mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) before diagnosis. Therefore, early diagnosis of AD is very 
critical. This paper mainly discusses the blood biomarkers of AD patients and 
uses machine learning methods to study the changes of blood transcriptome during 
the development of AD and to search for potential blood biomarkers for AD. 
Methods: Individualized blood mRNA expression data of 711 patients were 
downloaded from the GEO database, including the control group (CON) (238 
patients), MCI (189 patients), and AD (284 patients). Firstly, we analyzed the 
subcellular localization, protein types and enrichment pathways of the 
differentially expressed mRNAs in each group, and established an artificial 
intelligence individualized diagnostic model. Furthermore, the XCell tool was 
used to analyze the blood mRNA expression data and obtain blood cell composition 
and quantitative data. Ratio characteristics were established for mRNA and XCell 
data. Feature engineering operations such as collinearity and importance 
analysis were performed on all features to obtain the best feature solicitation. 
Finally, four machine learning algorithms, including linear support vector 
machine (SVM), Adaboost, random forest and artificial neural network, were used 
to model the optimal feature combinations and evaluate their classification 
performance in the test set. Results: Through feature engineering screening, the 
best feature collection was obtained. Moreover, the artificial intelligence 
individualized diagnosis model established based on this method achieved a 
classification accuracy of 91.59% in the test set. The area under curve (AUC) of 
CON, MCI, and AD were 0.9746, 0.9536, and 0.9807, respectively. Conclusion: The 
results of cell homeostasis analysis suggested that the homeostasis of Natural 
killer T cell (NKT) might be related to AD, and the homeostasis of Granulocyte 
macrophage progenitor (GMP) might be one of the reasons for AD.

BACKGROUND: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) and 
related technologies, AI algorithms are being embedded into various health 
information technologies that assist clinicians in clinical decision making.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore how clinicians perceive AI assistance in 
diagnostic decision making and suggest the paths forward for AI-human teaming 
for clinical decision making in health care.
METHODS: This study used a mixed methods approach, utilizing hierarchical linear 
modeling and sentiment analysis through natural language understanding 
techniques.
RESULTS: A total of 114 clinicians participated in online simulation surveys in 
2020 and 2021. These clinicians studied family medicine and used AI algorithms 
to aid in patient diagnosis. Their overall sentiment toward AI-assisted 
diagnosis was positive and comparable with diagnoses made without the assistance 
of AI. However, AI-guided decision making was not congruent with the way 
clinicians typically made decisions in diagnosing illnesses. In a quantitative 
survey, clinicians reported perceiving current AI assistance as not likely to 
enhance diagnostic capability and negatively influenced their overall 
performance (β=-0.421, P=.02). Instead, clinicians' diagnostic capabilities 
tended to be associated with well-known parameters, such as education, age, and 
daily habit of technology use on social media platforms.
CONCLUSIONS: This study elucidated clinicians' current perceptions and 
sentiments toward AI-enabled diagnosis. Although the sentiment was positive, the 
current form of AI assistance may not be linked with efficient decision making, 
as AI algorithms are not well aligned with subjective human reasoning in 
clinical diagnosis. Developers and policy makers in health could gather 
behavioral data from clinicians in various disciplines to help align AI 
algorithms with the unique subjective patterns of reasoning that humans employ 
in clinical diagnosis.

Artificial intelligence, and in particular deep learning using convolutional 
neural networks, has been used extensively for image classification and 
segmentation, including on medical images for diagnosis and prognosis 
prediction. Use in radiotherapy prognostic modelling is still limited, however, 
especially as applied to toxicity and tumour response prediction from radiation 
dose distributions. We review and summarise studies that applied deep learning 
to radiotherapy dose data, in particular studies that utilised full 
three-dimensional dose distributions. Ten papers have reported on deep learning 
models for outcome prediction utilising spatial dose information, whereas four 
studies used reduced dimensionality (dose volume histogram) information for 
prediction. Many of these studies suffer from the same issues that plagued early 
normal tissue complication probability modelling, including small, 
single-institutional patient cohorts, lack of external validation, poor data and 
model reporting, use of late toxicity data without taking time-to-event into 
account, and nearly exclusive focus on clinician-reported complications. They 
demonstrate, however, how radiation dose, imaging and clinical data may be 
technically integrated in convolutional neural networks-based models; and some 
studies explore how deep learning may help better understand spatial variation 
in radiosensitivity. In general, there are a number of issues specific to the 
intersection of radiotherapy outcome modelling and deep learning, for example 
translation of model developments into treatment plan optimisation, which will 
require further combined effort from the radiation oncology and artificial 
intelligence communities.

We are not ready to abandon the current schizophrenia construct, but should be 
prepared to do so.

The current schizophrenia construct as delineated in the latest editions of the 
DSM and the ICD has some strengths, but also many weaknesses. It improved the 
reliability of the diagnosis, made communication among clinicians, users and 
families less ambiguous, is useful for education and training, and for 
reimbursement and insurance purposes. However, many serious weaknesses should be 
considered. The term "Schizophrenia" does not recognize the heterogeneity of the 
disorder and might nourish the belief that schizophrenia represents a unitary 
disease. In addition, there is no agreement on the existence and nature of a 
"core aspect" of the disorder. Stable dimensions, in particular negative 
symptoms and cognitive impairment, which are key determinants of functioning, 
are not de facto regarded as core aspects. Finally, the construct is associated 
to the notion of a poor outcome, to a high level of stigma and has acquired a 
derogatory connotation. We are not ready but should be prepared to abandon the 
current schizophrenia construct. Clinicians and researchers should be encouraged 
to complement the ICD/DSM diagnosis with an in-depth characterization of the 
individual clinical picture, along with other variables, such as family history, 
comorbidities, vulnerability factors and personal trajectory. The "Primary 
Psychoses" construct, together with improved cross-sectional and longitudinal 
phenotypes from representative population and patient cohorts, and the 
availability of artificial intelligence methods, could lead to a new and more 
precise taxonomy of psychotic disorders, and increase the probability of 
identifying meaningful biomarkers to improve prevention, diagnosis, prognosis, 
and treatment for people suffering from psychotic disorders.

OBJECTIVE: The current study aimed to evaluate policies and actions for food 
environments by the Japanese Government using the Healthy Food Environment 
Policy Index (Food-EPI).
DESIGN: Public health experts rated the extent of implementation of food 
environment-related Policy and the Infrastructure-support components, compared 
with international best practices. Subsequently, the experts proposed and 
prioritised future actions to address implementation gaps in an online workshop.
SETTING: Japan.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of sixty-six experts rated policy implementation by the 
Japanese Government and twenty-three participated in the workshop on future 
actions.
RESULTS: The implementations of regulations on unhealthy foods and non-alcoholic 
beverages were rated low in the domains of Food composition, Food labelling and 
Food promotion, Food prices and Food retail in the Policy component. The 
implementations of several domains in the Infrastructure-support component were, 
overall, rated at a higher level, specifically for monitoring and intelligence 
systems. Based on the rating, reducing health inequalities by supporting people, 
both economically and physically, was the highest priority for future actions in 
both components.
CONCLUSIONS: The current study found that Japan has a robust system for 
long-term monitoring of population health but lacks regulations on unhealthy 
foods and non-alcoholic beverages compared with international best practices. 
The current study confirmed the importance of continuous accumulation of 
evidence through national monitoring systems. Developing comprehensive 
regulations to restrict food marketing, sales and accessibility of unhealthy 
foods and non-alcoholic beverages is needed to improve the health of food 
environments in Japan.

This brief review introduces the reader to tensor network methods, a powerful 
theoretical and numerical paradigm spawning from condensed matter physics and 
quantum information science and increasingly exploited in different fields of 
research, from artificial intelligence to quantum chemistry. Here, we specialize 
our presentation on the application of loop-free tensor network methods to the 
study of high-energy physics problems and, in particular, to the study of 
lattice gauge theories where tensor networks can be applied in regimes where 
Monte Carlo methods are hindered by the sign problem. This article is part of 
the theme issue 'Quantum technologies in particle physics'.

BACKGROUND: To accelerate healthcare/genomic medicine research and facilitate 
quality improvement, researchers have started cross-institutional collaborations 
to use artificial intelligence on clinical/genomic data. However, there are 
real-world risks of incorrect models being submitted to the learning process, 
due to either unforeseen accidents or malicious intent. This may reduce the 
incentives for institutions to participate in the federated modeling consortium. 
Existing methods to deal with this "model misconduct" issue mainly focus on 
modifying the learning methods, and therefore are more specifically tied with 
the algorithm.
BASIC PROCEDURES: In this paper, we aim at solving the problem in an 
algorithm-agnostic way by (1) designing a simulator to generate various types of 
model misconduct, (2) developing a framework to detect the model misconducts, 
and (3) providing a generalizable approach to identify model misconducts for 
federated learning. We considered the following three categories: Plagiarism, 
Fabrication, and Falsification, and then developed a detection framework with 
three components: Auditing, Coefficient, and Performance detectors, with greedy 
parameter tuning.
MAIN FINDINGS: We generated 10 types of misconducts from models learned on three 
datasets to evaluate our detection method. Our experiments showed high recall 
with low added computational cost. Our proposed detection method can best 
identify the misconduct on specific sites from any learning iteration, whereas 
it is more challenging to precisely detect misconducts for a specific site and 
at a specific iteration.
PRINCIPAL CONCLUSIONS: We anticipate our study can support the enhancement of 
the integrity and reliability of federated machine learning on 
genomic/healthcare data.

Direct visual enumeration of viruses under dark-field microscope (DFM) using 
plasmon resonance probes (PRPs) is fast and convenient; however, it is greatly 
limited in the assay of real samples because of its inability to accurately 
identify false positives owing to non-specific adsorption. In this study, we 
propose an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted DFM enumeration strategy for 
the accurate assay of Enterovirus A71 (an ultra-small human virus) using two 
PRPs; a 40 nm silver nanoparticle probe (SNP) that appears bright blue under 
DFM, and a 120 nm gold nanorod probe (GNP) that appears red under DFM. The 
capture chip was prepared by immobilizing the SNPs with antibodies on the glass 
to capture the target virus and to form dichromatic sandwich structures with the 
GNPs, followed by imaging under a dark field (DF). Subsequently, the DF images 
of the capture chip were subjected to a two-step screening: first, using image 
processing, and thereafter using the AI algorithm screening to eliminate false 
positive results and background noise. The results revealed that the data from 
the AI-assisted dual PRPs assay were highly consistent with those of 
quantitative PCR (qPCR), and that the sensitivity with a minimum detectable 
concentration of 3 copies/μL was 5 times higher than that of qPCR. The entire 
analysis was completed within 45 min. Therefore, our AI-assisted virus 
enumeration strategy with two DF PRPs holds great potential for ultra-sensitive 
and accurate quantification of viruses in real samples.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has transformed the diagnostic pathway for 
prostate cancer and now plays an upfront role before prostate biopsies. If a 
suspicious lesion is found on MRI, the subsequent biopsy can be targeted. A 
sharp increase is expected in the number of men who will undergo prostate MRI. 
The challenge is to provide good image quality and diagnostic accuracy while 
meeting the demands of the expected higher workload. A possible solution to this 
challenge is to include a suitable risk stratification tool before imaging. 
Other solutions, such as smarter and shorter MRI protocols, need to be explored. 
For most of these solutions, artificial intelligence (AI) can play an important 
role. AI applications have the potential to improve the diagnostic quality of 
the prostate MRI pathway and speed up the work. PATIENT SUMMARY: The use of 
prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for diagnosis of prostate cancer is 
increasing. Risk stratification of patients before imaging and the use of 
shorter scan protocols can help in managing MRI resources. Artificial 
intelligence can also play a role in automating some tasks.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to establish whether an artificially 
intelligent (AI) system can be developed to automate stress echocardiography 
analysis and support clinician interpretation.
BACKGROUND: Coronary artery disease is the leading global cause of mortality and 
morbidity and stress echocardiography remains one of the most commonly used 
diagnostic imaging tests.
METHODS: An automated image processing pipeline was developed to extract novel 
geometric and kinematic features from stress echocardiograms collected as part 
of a large, United Kingdom-based prospective, multicenter, multivendor study. An 
ensemble machine learning classifier was trained, using the extracted features, 
to identify patients with severe coronary artery disease on invasive coronary 
angiography. The model was tested in an independent U.S.
STUDY: How availability of an AI classification might impact clinical 
interpretation of stress echocardiograms was evaluated in a randomized crossover 
reader study.
RESULTS: Acceptable classification accuracy for identification of patients with 
severe coronary artery disease in the training data set was achieved on 
cross-fold validation based on 31 unique geometric and kinematic features, with 
a specificity of 92.7% and a sensitivity of 84.4%. This accuracy was maintained 
in the independent validation data set. The use of the AI classification tool by 
clinicians increased inter-reader agreement and confidence as well as 
sensitivity for detection of disease by 10% to achieve an area under the 
receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.93.
CONCLUSIONS: Automated analysis of stress echocardiograms is possible using AI 
and provision of automated classifications to clinicians when reading stress 
echocardiograms could improve accuracy, inter-reader agreement, and reader 
confidence.

Ethical artificial intelligence (AI) frameworks can be the catalyst in improving 
the safety and wellbeing of people when developing AI systems. In 2020 
Rolls-Royce released its ethical and trustworthiness toolkit, The Aletheia 
FrameworkTM, which helps guide organisations as they consider the ethics around 
the use of AI. It covers three facets: social impact, accuracy and trust, and 
governance - which apply across all uses of AI. By adopting AI ethics and trust 
frameworks, oncologists can ensure the ratio between the benefit and harms of AI 
can be maximised. With AI transforming every sector, collaboration across 
industries to share ideas and learn from each other - even unlikely partnerships 
between engineering and oncology - could help optimise that transition.

Modern artificial intelligence techniques have solved some previously 
intractable problems and produced impressive results in selected medical 
domains. One of their drawbacks is that they often need very large amounts of 
data. Pre-existing datasets in the form of national cancer registries, 
image/genetic depositories and clinical datasets already exist and have been 
used for research. In theory, the combination of healthcare Big Data with 
modern, data-hungry artificial intelligence techniques should offer significant 
opportunities for artificial intelligence development, but this has not yet 
happened. Here we discuss some of the structural reasons for this, barriers 
preventing artificial intelligence from making full use of existing datasets, 
and make suggestions as to enable progress. To do this, we use the framework of 
the 6Vs of Big Data and the FAIR criteria for data sharing and availability 
(Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse). We share our 
experience in navigating these barriers through The Brain Tumour Data 
Accelerator, a Brain Tumour Charity-supported initiative to integrate fragmented 
patient data into an enriched dataset. We conclude with some comments as to the 
limits of such approaches.

As information communication technology (ICT) has advanced, the healthcare 
industry has embraced it to reduce medical costs, improve health outcomes, and 
increase patient satisfaction. Healthcare ICT revolutionizes pediatric 
healthcare. This study aimed to categorize and synthesize findings from the 
literature regarding the application of ICT in pediatric patients. This 
systematic review is based on a comprehensive search of Embase, MEDLINE, and 
Google Scholar. Study selection and coding were performed independently by 2 
researchers, followed by narrative categorization. To reflect current trends in 
ICT for pediatrics, we adopted the Hype cycle technology classification 
developed by the advisory and information technology firm, Gartner, and the 
classification of digital health interventions by the World Health Organization. 
This study included a total of 135 studies. The analysis revealed 7 main types 
of ICT for pediatrics: (1) telehealth (39 papers), (2) precision medicine (2 
papers), (3) automated decision support systems (17 papers), (4) electronic 
health records (7 papers), (5) patient portals (7 papers), (6) artificial 
intelligence (AI) (39 papers), and (7) mobile and wearable technologies (20 
papers). In particular, we consistently found references to ICT for pediatrics 
as well as changing and improving healthcare for children. Further studies are 
required to determine how we can improve ICT productivity for pediatrics, 
particularly through AI. This study's results will help healthcare delivery 
organizations and technology companies consider the future direction of 
pediatric healthcare.

Stability is a key ingredient of protein fitness, and its modification through 
targeted mutations has applications in various fields, such as protein 
engineering, drug design, and deleterious variant interpretation. Many studies 
have been devoted over the past decades to build new, more effective methods for 
predicting the impact of mutations on protein stability based on the latest 
developments in artificial intelligence. We discuss their features, algorithms, 
computational efficiency, and accuracy estimated on an independent test set. We 
focus on a critical analysis of their limitations, the recurrent biases 
toward the training set, their generalizability, and interpretability. We found 
that the accuracy of the predictors has stagnated at around 1 kcal/mol for over 
15 years. We conclude by discussing the challenges that need to be addressed to 
reach improved performance.

BACKGROUND: Early and automated detection of carotid plaques prevents strokes, 
which are the second leading cause of death worldwide according to the World 
Health Organization. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers automated solutions for 
plaque tissue characterization. Recently, solo deep learning (SDL) models have 
been used, but they do not take advantage of the tandem connectivity offered by 
AI's hybrid nature. Therefore, this study explores the use of hybrid deep 
learning (HDL) models in a multicenter framework, making this study the first of 
its kind.
METHODS: We hypothesize that HDL techniques perform better than SDL and transfer 
learning (TL) techniques. We propose two kinds of HDL frameworks: (i) the fusion 
of two SDLs (Inception with ResNet) or (ii) 10 other kinds of tandem models that 
fuse SDL with ML. The system Atheromatic™ 2.0HDL (AtheroPoint, CA, USA) was 
designed on an augmentation framework and three kinds of loss functions 
(cross-entropy, hinge, and mean-square-error) during training to determine the 
best optimization paradigm. These 11 combined HDL models were then benchmarked 
against one SDL model and five types of TL models; thus, this study considers a 
total of 17 AI models.
RESULTS: Among the 17 AI models, the best performing HDL system was that 
comprising CNN and decision tree (DT), as its accuracy and area-under-the-curve 
were 99.78 ± 1.05% and 0.99 (p<0.0001), respectively. These values are 6.4% and 
3.2% better than those recorded for the SDL and TL models, respectively. We 
validated the performance of the HDL models with diagnostics odds ratio (DOR) 
and Cohen and Kappa statistics; here, HDL outperformed DL and TL by 23% and 7%, 
respectively. The online system ran in <2 s.
CONCLUSION: HDL is a fast, reliable, and effective tool for characterizing the 
carotid plaque for early stroke risk stratification.

The laccase enzymatic characteristics and delignification processes of rice 
straw by Comamonas testosteroni FJ17 were investigated. Artificial intelligence 
modeling and molecular docking revealed the specific functional properties 
involved in the interaction between laccase and lignin compounds with a maximum 
laccase activity of 2016.7 U L-1 at 24 h. Scanning electron microscopy and X-ray 
diffractometer analysis confirmed that laccase caused fractures and holes on the 
surface of rice straw, where crystallinity decrease from 45.3 to 39.9%, and 
lignin content decreased from 19.0 to 10.3%. Gas chromatography-mass 
spectrometry and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis showed that 
the main delignification process for laccase was via β-o-4 and α-aryl ether 
cleavage, which generated several small molecular products. The laccase gene was 
cloned and bioinformatics analysis presented 317 amino acids with a predicted 
molecular weight of 33.13 kDa. Finally, laccase protein was found to have low 
binding energies with all lignin compounds tested, and lignin compounds were 
oxidized by laccase through hydrogen-bonding interactions with the amino acid 
residues.

This work investigates the application of empirical, statistical and machine 
learning methods to appraise the prediction of transmembrane pressure (TMP) by 
oscillating slotted pore membrane for the treatment of two kinds of deformable 
oil drops. Here, we utilized the previous experimental runs with permeate flux, 
shear rate and filtration time as features, while TMP of crude oil and Tween-20 
were two distinct targets. For 87 experimental runs, Response surface 
methodology (RSM) and Artificial Neural network (ANN) modelling were opted as 
statistical and machine learning tools, respectively, which were comprehensively 
compared with empirical slot-pore blocking model (SBM) considering accuracy and 
generalization. ANN with 10 neurons in the hidden layer could approximate the 
TMP of both oils better than RSM and SBM, which is reflected by computed 
performance metrics. Under the given conditions, almost similar analysis were 
predicted for TMP of both oils except changes in magnitude which were 
interpreted by (1) line plots, which showed that TMP of crude oil and Tween-20 
were linearly related to flux rate and filtration time, and there was an inverse 
relationship between TMP and shear rate, (2) contour plots, which illustrated 
the strong interaction effect of flux rate and time on TMP, and (3)- sensitivity 
analysis, which revealed the influential sequence of variables on TMP as; flux 
rate > filtration time > shear rate, for both cases. The optimisation of the 
process showed that minimum TMP can be attained by maintaining higher shear rate 
and lower flux rate and time. Conclusively, the current findings indicate the 
utilization of ANN for the accurate assessment of TMP and can be helpful for the 
process designing and scale up.

Air pollution is the existence of atmospheric chemicals damaging the health of 
human beings and other living organisms or damaging the environment or 
resources. Rarely any common contaminants are smog, nicotine, mold, yeast, 
biogas, or carbon dioxide. The paper will primarily observe, visualize and 
anticipate pollution levels. In particular, three algorithms of Artificial 
Intelligence were used to create good forecasting models and a predictive AQI 
model for 4 distinct gases: carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, 
and atmospheric particulate matter. Thus, in this paper, the Air Qualification 
Index is developed utilizing Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, and 
the Gradient Boosted Decision Tree GBDT Ensembles model over the next 5 h and 
analyzes air qualities using various sensors. The hypothesized artificial 
intelligence models are evaluated to the Root Mean Squares Error, Mean Squared 
Error and Mean absolute error, depending upon the performance measurements and a 
lower error value model is chosen. Based on the algorithm of the Artificial 
Intelligent System, the level of 5 air pollutants like CO2, SO2, NO2, PM 2.5 and 
PM10 can be predicted immediately by integrating the observations with errors. 
It may be used to detect air quality from distance in large cities and can 
assist lower the degree of environmental pollution.

OBJECTIVES: To demonstrate the feasibility of an automated, non-invasive 
approach to estimate bone marrow (BM) infiltration of multiple myeloma (MM) by 
dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) after virtual non-calcium (VNCa) 
post-processing.
METHODS: Individuals with MM and monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance 
(MGUS) with concurrent DECT and BM biopsy between May 2018 and July 2020 were 
included in this retrospective observational study. Two pathologists and three 
radiologists reported BM infiltration and presence of osteolytic bone lesions, 
respectively. Bone mineral density (BMD) was quantified CT-based by a 
CE-certified software. Automated spine segmentation was implemented by a 
pre-trained convolutional neural network. The non-fatty portion of BM was 
defined as voxels > 0 HU in VNCa. For statistical assessment, multivariate 
regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) were conducted.
RESULTS: Thirty-five patients (mean age 65 ± 12 years; 18 female) were 
evaluated. The non-fatty portion of BM significantly predicted BM infiltration 
after adjusting for the covariable BMD (p = 0.007, r = 0.46). A non-fatty 
portion of BM > 0.93% could anticipate osteolytic lesions and the clinical 
diagnosis of MM with an area under the ROC curve of 0.70 [0.49-0.90] and 0.71 
[0.54-0.89], respectively. Our approach identified MM-patients without 
osteolytic lesions on conventional CT with a sensitivity and specificity of 0.63 
and 0.71, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Automated, AI-supported attenuation assessment of the spine in DECT 
VNCa is feasible to predict BM infiltration in MM. Further, the proposed method 
might allow for pre-selecting patients with higher pre-test probability of 
osteolytic bone lesions and support the clinical diagnosis of MM without 
pathognomonic lesions on conventional CT.
KEY POINTS: • The retrospective study provides an automated approach for 
quantification of the non-fatty portion of bone marrow, based on AI-supported 
spine segmentation and virtual non-calcium dual-energy CT data. • An increasing 
non-fatty portion of bone marrow is associated with a higher infiltration 
determined by invasive biopsy after adjusting for bone mineral density as a 
control variable (p = 0.007, r = 0.46). • The non-fatty portion of bone marrow 
might support the clinical diagnosis of multiple myeloma when conventional CT 
images are negative (sensitivity 0.63, specificity 0.71).

Since the beginning of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, it has been clear that effective methods for the 
diagnosis of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) are the key tools to control 
its epidemic. The current gold standard for diagnosing COVID-19 is the real-time 
quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), which is 
a sensitive and specific method to detect SARS-CoV-2. Other RNA-based methods 
include RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), droplet digital reverse 
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (ddRT-PCR), reverse transcription 
loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), and clustered regularly 
interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR). The serological testing of 
antibodies (IgM and IgG), nanoparticle-based lateral-flow assay, and 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) can be used to enhance the detection 
sensitivity and accuracy. Because antibodies are usually detected a week after 
the onset of symptoms, these tests are used to assess the overall infection rate 
in the community. Sine the fact that healthcare varies from country to country 
across the world, different types of diagnosing COVID-19 imaging technologies 
including chest computed tomography (CT), chest radiography, and lung ultrasound 
are used in different degrees. Besides, the pooling test is an important public 
health tool to reduce cost and increase testing capacity in low-risk area, while 
artificial intelligence (AI) may aid to increase the diagnostic efficiency of 
imaging-based methods. Finally, depending on the type of samples and stages of 
the disease, a combination of information on patient demographics and histories, 
clinical symptoms, results of molecular and serological diagnostic tests, and 
imaging information is highly recommended to achieve adequate diagnosis of 
patients with COVID-19.

PURPOSE: This study was aimed at comparing the conscientious intelligence levels 
of nursing students and determining the factors affecting their conscientious 
intelligence.
DESIGN AND METHODS: Two hundred and forty nursing students were involved in the 
study.
FINDINGS: There were no statistically significant differences between the first 
and fourth-year students in terms of the mean scores they obtained from the 
compassion, responsibility toward the creator, conscious awareness, and social 
sensitivity sub-dimensions. Of the students, those who chose the profession 
willingly, those who were women and those who did not perceive nursing as a 
profession just to earn money obtained higher mean scores in the Conscientious 
Intelligence Scale.
PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: The results of the study revealed that Nurse Academics 
should make more attempts to improve students' conscientious intelligence.

Over the past five decades, tremendous effort has been devoted to computational 
methods for predicting properties of ligands-i.e., molecules that bind 
macromolecular targets. Such methods, which are critical to rational drug 
design, fall into two categories: physics-based methods, which directly model 
ligand interactions with the target given the target's three-dimensional (3D) 
structure, and ligand-based methods, which predict ligand properties given 
experimental measurements for similar ligands. Here, we present a rigorous 
statistical framework to combine these two sources of information. We develop a 
method to predict a ligand's pose-the 3D structure of the ligand bound to its 
target-that leverages a widely available source of information: a list of other 
ligands that are known to bind the same target but for which no 3D structure is 
available. This combination of physics-based and ligand-based modeling improves 
pose prediction accuracy across all major families of drug targets. Using the 
same framework, we develop a method for virtual screening of drug candidates, 
which outperforms standard physics-based and ligand-based virtual screening 
methods. Our results suggest broad opportunities to improve prediction of 
various ligand properties by combining diverse sources of information through 
customized machine-learning approaches.

The potential value of AI to healthcare, and nursing in particular, ranges from 
improving quality and efficiency of care to delivering on the promise of 
personalized and precision medicine. AI systems may become virtually 
indispensable as ever more data is amassed about every aspect of health. AI can 
help reduce variability in care, while improving precision, accelerating 
discovery and reducing disparities. AI can empower patients and potentially 
allow healthcare professionals to relate to their patients as healers supported 
by the combined wisdom of the best medical research and analytic technology. 
There are, however, many challenges to understanding the optimal uses of AI; 
addressing the technological, systemic, regulatory and attitudinal roadblocks to 
successful implementation; and integrating AI into the fabric of health care. 
This paper provides a grounding in the origins and fundamental building blocks 
of AI, applications in healthcare and for nursing, and the critical challenges 
facing implementation in healthcare.

Advances in voice recognition, natural language processing, and artificial 
intelligence have led to the increasing availability and use of conversational 
agents (chatbots) in different settings. Chatbots are systems that mimic human 
dialogue interaction through text or voice. This paper describes a series of 
design considerations for integrating chatbots interfaces with health services. 
The present paper is part of ongoing work that explores the overall 
implementation of chatbots in the healthcare context. The findings have been 
created using a research through design process, combining (1) literature survey 
of existing body of knowledge on designing chatbots, (2) analysis on 
state-of-the-practice in using chatbots as service interfaces, and (3) 
generative process of designing a chatbot interface for depression screening. In 
this paper we describe considerations that would be useful for the design of a 
chatbot for a healthcare context.

Perceiving minds in technology agents, for example, robots designed with 
artificial intelligence (AI), is common and crucial in modern life. However, 
past studies have revealed that robots with a high level of minds elicit 
polarized responses. From a human-robot interaction perspective, we proposed 
that people' responses to robots, in part, originate from differences between 
fixed and growth mindsets about human minds-the beliefs regarding whether 
humans' mental capacities are fixed or incremental. We conducted five studies to 
test this assumption. A growth mindset about human minds was associated with or 
led to lower levels of negative feelings about robots (Study 1), more 
perceptions of robots as allies versus enemies (Study 2), more support for 
robotic research (Studies 3 and 4), and greater willingness to interact with 
robots (Study 5). Furthermore, the effect of a growth mindset about human minds 
on favorable responses to robots was more pronounced when robots were perceived 
as having high (versus low) levels of minds (Studies 3-5) and mediated by 
decreased concerns about robots (Study 5). By emphasizing the nuanced role of 
mindset beliefs about human minds in responses to intelligent technology, this 
research provides not only a new perspective on research into minds but also

In past decades, the industrial and technological developments have increased 
exponentially and accompanied by non-judicial and un-sustainable utilization of 
non-renewable resources. At the same time, the environmental branch of 
toxicology has gained significant attention in understanding the effect of toxic 
chemicals on human health. Environmental toxic agents cause several diseases, 
particularly high risk among children, pregnant women, geriatrics and clinical 
patients. Since air pollution affects human health and results in increased 
morbidity and mortality increased the toxicological studies focusing on 
industrial air pollution absorbed by the common people. Therefore, it is needed 
to design an automated Environmental Toxicology based Air Pollution Monitoring 
System. To resolve the limitations of traditional monitoring system and to 
reduce the overall cost, this paper designs an IoT enabled Environmental 
Toxicology for Air Pollution Monitoring using Artificial Intelligence technique 
(ETAPM-AIT) to improve human health. The proposed ETAPM-AIT model includes a set 
of IoT based sensor array to sense eight pollutants namely NH3, CO, NO2, CH4, 
CO2, PM2.5, temperature and humidity. The sensor array measures the pollutant 
level and transmits it to the cloud server via gateways for analytic process. 
The proposed model aims to report the status of air quality in real time by 
using cloud server and sends an alarm in the presence of hazardous pollutants 
level in the air. For the classification of air pollutants and determining air 
quality, Artificial Algae Algorithm (AAA) based Elman Neural Network (ENN) model 
is used as a classifier, which predicts the air quality in the forthcoming time 
stamps. The AAA is applied as a parameter tuning technique to optimally 
determine the parameter values of the ENN model. In-order to examine the air 
quality monitoring performance of the proposed ETAPM-AIT model, an extensive set 
of simulation analysis is performed and the results are inspected in 5, 15, 30 
and 60 min of duration respectively. The experimental outcome highlights the 
optimal performance of the proposed ETAPM-AIT model over the recent techniques.

Autonomous experimentation enabled by artificial intelligence offers a new 
paradigm for accelerating scientific discovery. Nonequilibrium materials 
synthesis is emblematic of complex, resource-intensive experimentation whose 
acceleration would be a watershed for materials discovery. We demonstrate 
accelerated exploration of metastable materials through hierarchical autonomous 
experimentation governed by the Scientific Autonomous Reasoning Agent (SARA). 
SARA integrates robotic materials synthesis using lateral gradient laser spike 
annealing and optical characterization along with a hierarchy of AI methods to 
map out processing phase diagrams. Efficient exploration of the multidimensional 
parameter space is achieved with nested active learning cycles built upon 
advanced machine learning models that incorporate the underlying physics of the 
experiments and end-to-end uncertainty quantification. We demonstrate SARA’s 
performance by autonomously mapping synthesis phase boundaries for the Bi2O3 
system, leading to orders-of-magnitude acceleration in the establishment of a 
synthesis phase diagram that includes conditions for stabilizing δ-Bi2O3 at room 
temperature, a critical development for electrochemical technologies.

OBJECTIVES:  To conduct a systematic survey of published techniques for 
automated diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19 diseases using medical imaging, 
assessing the validity of reported performance and investigating the proposed 
clinical use-case. To conduct a scoping review into the authors publishing such 
work.
METHODS:  The Scopus database was queried and studies were screened for article 
type, and minimum source normalized impact per paper and citations, before 
manual relevance assessment and a bias assessment derived from a subset of the 
Checklist for Artificial Intelligence in Medical Imaging (CLAIM). The number of 
failures of the full CLAIM was adopted as a surrogate for risk-of-bias. 
Methodological and performance measurements were collected from each technique. 
Each study was assessed by one author. Comparisons were evaluated for 
significance with a two-sided independent t-test.
FINDINGS:  Of 1002 studies identified, 390 remained after screening and 81 after 
relevance and bias exclusion. The ratio of exclusion for bias was 71%, 
indicative of a high level of bias in the field. The mean number of CLAIM 
failures per study was 8.3 ± 3.9 [1,17] (mean ± standard deviation [min,max]). 
58% of methods performed diagnosis versus 31% prognosis. Of the diagnostic 
methods, 38% differentiated COVID-19 from healthy controls. For diagnostic 
techniques, area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) = 0.924 ± 0.074 
[0.810,0.991] and accuracy = 91.7% ± 6.4 [79.0,99.0]. For prognostic techniques, 
AUC = 0.836 ± 0.126 [0.605,0.980] and accuracy = 78.4% ± 9.4 [62.5,98.0]. CLAIM 
failures did not correlate with performance, providing confidence that the 
highest results were not driven by biased papers. Deep learning techniques 
reported higher AUC (p < 0.05) and accuracy (p < 0.05), but no difference in 
CLAIM failures was identified.
INTERPRETATION:  A majority of papers focus on the less clinically impactful 
diagnosis task, contrasted with prognosis, with a significant portion performing 
a clinically unnecessary task of differentiating COVID-19 from healthy. Authors 
should consider the clinical scenario in which their work would be deployed when 
developing techniques. Nevertheless, studies report superb performance in a 
potentially impactful application. Future work is warranted in translating 
techniques into clinical tools.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
OBJECTIVES: To assess the ability of a convolutional neural network (CNN) model 
to differentiate osteoporotic vertebral fractures (OVFs) and malignant vertebral 
compression fractures (MVFs) using short-TI inversion recovery (STIR) and 
T1-weighted images (T1WI) and to compare it to the performance of three spine 
surgeons.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Differentiating between OVFs and MVFs is crucial for 
appropriate clinical staging and treatment planning. However, an accurate 
diagnosis is sometimes difficult. Recently, CNN modeling-an artificial 
intelligence technique-has gained popularity in the radiology field.
METHODS: We enrolled 50 patients with OVFs and 47 patients with MVFs who 
underwent thoracolumbar MRI. Sagittal STIR images and sagittal T1WI were used to 
train and validate the CNN models. To assess the performance of the CNN, the 
receiver operating characteristic curve was plotted and the area under the curve 
was calculated. We also compared the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 
the diagnosis made by the CNN and three spine surgeons.
RESULTS: The area under the curve of receiver operating characteristic curves of 
the CNN based on STIR images and T1WI were 0.967 and 0.984, respectively. The 
CNN model based on STIR images showed a performance of 93.8% accuracy, 92.5% 
sensitivity, and 94.9% specificity. On the other hand, the CNN model based on 
T1WI showed a performance of 96.4% accuracy, 98.1% sensitivity, and 94.9% 
specificity. The accuracy and specificity of the CNN using both STIR and T1WI 
were statistically equal to or better than that of three spine surgeons. There 
were no significant differences in sensitivity based on both STIR images and 
T1WI between the CNN and spine surgeons.
CONCLUSION: We successfully differentiated OVFs and MVFs based on MRI with high 
accuracy using the CNN model, which was statistically equal or superior to that 
of the spine surgeons.Level of Evidence: 4.

University, Dalian City, Liaoning Province, China.

BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence system is a deep learning system based on 
computer-assisted ultrasonic image diagnosis, which can extract morphological 
features of breast mass and conduct objective and efficient image analysis, thus 
automatically intelligent classification of breast mass, avoiding subjective 
error and improving the accuracy of diagnosis.[1-2] A large number of studies 
have confirmed that artificial intelligence (AI) has high effectiveness and 
reliability in the differential diagnosis of benign and malignant breast 
diseases.[3-4] However, the results of these studies have been contradictory. 
Therefore, this meta-analysis tested the hypothesis that artificial intelligence 
system is accurate in distinguishing benign and malignant breast diseases.
METHODS: We will search PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Chinese 
biomedical databases from their inceptions to the November 20, 2021, without 
language restrictions. Two authors will independently carry out searching 
literature records, scanning titles and abstracts, full texts, collecting data, 
and assessing risk of bias. Review Manager 5.2 and Stata14.0 software will be 
used for data analysis.
RESULTS: This systematic review will determine the accuracy of AI in the 
differential diagnosis of benign and malignant breast diseases.
CONCLUSION: Its findings will provide helpful evidence for the accuracy of AI in 
the differential diagnosis of benign and malignant breast diseases.

China.

RATIONALE: Chromosome 18 long arm deletion syndrome is a group of clinical 
syndromes caused by partial or total genetic material deletion of the long arm 
of chromosome 18 (18q), whose clinical manifestations are related to 
presentation and developmental abnormalities in various aspects such as 
intelligence, face, and movement. Prenatal diagnosis of this syndrome is 
challenging because of its low incidence and uncharacteristic prenatal clinical 
performance. In this paper, 2 cases of partial deletion of 18q found in prenatal 
amniotic fluid examination by high-throughput sequencing were reported and 
analyzed.
PATIENT CONCERNS: In patient 1, non-invasive prenatal gene detection at 
21 + 2 weeks of gestation suggests a risk of trisomy 18. In patient 2, 
ultrasound examination at 21 + 2 weeks of gestation revealed a single live 
fetus, but it was difficult to pinpoint whether the fetus had only 1 umbilical 
artery to supply blood.
DIAGNOSIS AND INTERVENTION: The 18q deletion syndrome was diagnosed by 
chromosome karyotype analysis and high-throughput sequencing.
OUTCOMES: The pregnancies were terminated due to the abnormal chromosome.
LESSON: This report adds novel variants to the genetic profile of 18q deletion, 
in order to enrich the genetic data of long arm deletion of 18 chromosomes and 
provide better services for pre-screening, diagnosis, and genetic counseling for 
this disease.

Biology and Medicinal Chemistry, Rheinische Friedrich Wilhelms-Universität, 
Bonn, Germany.

INTRODUCTION: The popularity and success of advanced AI methods like deep neural 
networks has led to novel ways for exploring chemical space. Their opaque nature 
poses challenges for model evaluation regarding novelty, uniqueness, and 
distribution of the chemical space covered. However, these methods also promise 
to be able to explore uncharted chemical space in novel ways that do not rely 
directly on structural similarity.
AREAS COVERED: This review provides an overview of popular deep learning methods 
for chemical space exploration. Crucial aspects like choice of molecular 
representation, training for focused chemical space exploration, and criteria 
for assessing and validating chemical space coverage are discussed.
EXPERT OPINION: Deep learning offers great potential for chemical space 
exploration beyond conventional fragment-based methods. Given the rarity of 
prospective applications and considering the difficulty in assessing 
representativeness and comprehensiveness of chemical space covered, developing 
criteria for assessing and validating generative models is of great 
significance. Latent space models like variational autoencoders are conceptually 
appealing for inverse QSAR/QSPR approaches as neighborhood relationships in 
latent space can be trained to reflect property similarities. Future research in 
understanding and interpreting generative models might lead to a better 
understanding of biologically relevant properties of molecules.

of Medicine, Toronto, ON, Canada.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: There are a number of available methods for diagnosing 
onychomycosis, but more emerge as technology advances. This review briefly 
discusses the common diagnostic methods, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) 
as a diagnostic tool in dermatology as a whole, and then examines research on 
the use of AI for diagnosing onychomycosis. The studies discussed implemented 
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to examine datasets of images of entire 
nails or histological images and then used the information learned from those 
datasets to make a diagnostic decision of onychomycosis or not.
RESULTS: Results: It was found that, on average, AI were able to diagnose 
onychomycosis from the images provided at an equivalent level as human 
dermatologists. However, there are a number of clear limitations for using AI in 
this manner. The AI models implemented relied solely on images and therefore 
were limited by image quality. As only images were examined, other clinical data 
were not taken into consideration, which could be important to the diagnostic 
outcome.
CONCLUSION: Conclusion: In conclusion, although AI can be a very helpful tool in 
the diagnostic process by increasing efficiency and reducing costs, it still 
requires the precision and expertise of professional dermatologists to be used 
optimally.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Treatment planning of radiotherapy for locally advanced 
breast cancer patients can be a time consuming process. Artificial intelligence 
based treatment planning could be used as a tool to speed up this process and 
maintain plan quality consistency. The purpose of this study was to create 
treatment plans for locally advanced breast cancer patients using a 
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data of 60 patients treated for left-sided breast cancer 
was used with a training, validation and test split of 36/12/12, respectively. 
The in-house built CNN model was a hierarchically densely connected U-net (HD 
U-net). The inputs for the HD U-net were 2D distance maps of the relevant 
regions of interest. Dose predictions, generated by the HD U-net, were used for 
a mimicking algorithm in order to create clinically deliverable plans.
RESULTS: Dose predictions were generated by the HD U-net and mimicked using a 
commercial treatment planning system. The predicted plans fulfilling all 
clinical goals while showing small (≤0.5 Gy) statistically significant 
differences (p < 0.05) in the doses compared to the manual plans. The mimicked 
plans show statistically significant differences in the average doses for the 
heart and lung of ≤0.5 Gy and a reduced D2% of all PTVs. In total, ten of the 
twelve mimicked plans were clinically acceptable.
CONCLUSIONS: We created a CNN model which can generate clinically acceptable 
plans for left-sided locally advanced breast cancer patients. This model shows 
great potential to speed up the treatment planning process while maintaining 
consistent plan quality.

BACKGROUND: Patient selection for outpatient total joint arthroplasty (TJA) is 
important for optimizing patient outcomes. This study develops machine learning 
models that may aid in patient selection for outpatient TJA based on medical 
comorbidities and demographic factors.
METHODS: This study queried elective total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and total hip 
arthroplasty (THA) cases during 2010-2018 in the American College of Surgeons 
National Surgical Quality Improvement Program. Artificial neural network models 
predicted same-day discharge and length of stay (LOS) fewer than 2 days (short 
LOS). Multiple linear and logistic regression analyses were used to identify 
variables significantly associated with predicted outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 284,731 TKA cases and 153,053 THA cases met inclusion 
criteria. For TKA, prediction of short LOS had an area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.767 and accuracy of 84.1%; prediction 
of same-day discharge had an AUC of 0.802 and accuracy of 89.2%. For THA, 
prediction of short LOS had an AUC of 0.757 and accuracy of 70.6%; prediction of 
same-day discharge had an AUC of 0.814 and accuracy of 78.8%.
CONCLUSION: This study developed machine learning models for aiding patient 
selection for outpatient TJA, through accurately predicting short LOS or 
outpatient vs inpatient cases. As outpatient TJA expands, it will be important 
to optimize preoperative patient selection and effectively screen surgical 
candidates from a broader patient population. Incorporating models such as these 
into electronic medical records could aid in decision-making and resource 
planning in real time.

BACKGROUND: In settings without access to rapid expert radiographic 
interpretation, artificial intelligence (AI)-based chest radiograph (CXR) 
analysis can triage persons presenting with possible tuberculosis (TB) symptoms, 
to identify those who require additional microbiological testing. However, there 
is limited evidence of the cost-effectiveness of this technology as a triage 
tool.
METHODS: A decision analysis model was developed to evaluate the 
cost-effectiveness of triage strategies with AI-based CXR analysis for patients 
presenting with symptoms suggestive of pulmonary TB in Karachi, Pakistan. These 
strategies were compared to the current standard of care using microbiological 
testing with smear microscopy or GeneXpert, without prior triage. Positive 
triage CXRs were considered to improve referral success for microbiologic 
testing, from 91% to 100% for eligible persons. Software diagnostic accuracy was 
based on a prospective field study in Karachi. Other inputs were obtained from 
the Pakistan TB Program. The analysis was conducted from the healthcare provider 
perspective, and costs were expressed in 2020 US dollars.
RESULTS: Compared to upfront smear microscopy for all persons with presumptive 
TB, triage strategies with AI-based CXR analysis were projected to lower costs 
by 19%, from $23233 per 1000 persons, and avert 3%-4% disability-adjusted 
life-years (DALYs), from 372 DALYs. Compared to upfront GeneXpert, AI-based 
triage strategies lowered projected costs by 37%, from $34346 and averted 4% 
additional DALYs, from 369 DALYs. Reinforced follow-up for persons with positive 
triage CXRs but negative microbiologic tests was particularly cost-effective.
CONCLUSIONS: In lower-resource settings, the addition of AI-based CXR triage 
before microbiologic testing for persons with possible TB symptoms can reduce 
costs, avert additional DALYs, and improve TB detection.

BACKGROUND: Chatbots and virtual voice assistants are increasingly common in 
primary care without sufficient evidence for their feasibility and 
effectiveness. We aimed to assess how perceived stigma and severity of various 
health issues are associated with the acceptability for three sources of health 
information and consultation: an automated chatbot, a General Practitioner (GP), 
or a combination of both.
METHODS: Between May and June 2019, we conducted an online study, advertised via 
Facebook, for UK citizens. It was a factorial simulation experiment with three 
within-subject factors (perceived health issue stigma, severity, and 
consultation source) and six between-subject covariates. Acceptability rating 
for each consultation source was the dependant variable. A single mixed-model 
ANOVA was performed.
RESULTS: Amongst 237 participants (65% aged over 45 years old, 73% women), GP 
consultations were seen as most acceptable, followed by GP-chatbot service. 
Chatbots were seen least acceptable as a consultation source for severe health 
issues, while the acceptability was significantly higher for stigmatised health 
issues. No associations between participants' characteristics and acceptability 
were found.
CONCLUSIONS: Although healthcare professionals are perceived as the most desired 
sources of health information, chatbots may be useful for sensitive health 
issues in which disclosure of personal information is challenging. However, 
chatbots are less acceptable for health issues of higher severity and should not 
be recommended for use within that context. Policymakers and digital service 
designers need to recognise the limitations of health chatbots. Future research 
should establish a set of health topics most suitable for chatbot-led 
interventions and primary healthcare services.

Extensive sampling of neural activity during rich cognitive phenomena is 
critical for robust understanding of brain function. Here we present the Natural 
Scenes Dataset (NSD), in which high-resolution functional magnetic resonance 
imaging responses to tens of thousands of richly annotated natural scenes were 
measured while participants performed a continuous recognition task. To optimize 
data quality, we developed and applied novel estimation and denoising 
techniques. Simple visual inspections of the NSD data reveal clear 
representational transformations along the ventral visual pathway. Further 
exemplifying the inferential power of the dataset, we used NSD to build and 
train deep neural network models that predict brain activity more accurately 
than state-of-the-art models from computer vision. NSD also includes substantial 
resting-state and diffusion data, enabling network neuroscience perspectives to 
constrain and enhance models of perception and memory. Given its unprecedented 
scale, quality and breadth, NSD opens new avenues of inquiry in cognitive 
neuroscience and artificial intelligence.

Machine learning (ML) has demonstrated promise in predicting mortality; however, 
understanding spatial variation in risk factor contributions to mortality rate 
requires explainability. We applied explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) on 
a stack-ensemble machine learning model framework to explore and visualize the 
spatial distribution of the contributions of known risk factors to lung and 
bronchus cancer (LBC) mortality rates in the conterminous United States. We used 
five base-learners-generalized linear model (GLM), random forest (RF), Gradient 
boosting machine (GBM), extreme Gradient boosting machine (XGBoost), and Deep 
Neural Network (DNN) for developing stack-ensemble models. Then we applied 
several model-agnostic approaches to interpret and visualize the stack ensemble 
model's output in global and local scales (at the county level). The stack 
ensemble generally performs better than all the base learners and three spatial 
regression models. A permutation-based feature importance technique ranked 
smoking prevalence as the most important predictor, followed by poverty and 
elevation. However, the impact of these risk factors on LBC mortality rates 
varies spatially. This is the first study to use ensemble machine learning with 
explainable algorithms to explore and visualize the spatial heterogeneity of the 
relationships between LBC mortality and risk factors in the contiguous USA.

INTRODUCTION: Intravenous glucocorticoids pulse therapy is the first-line 
treatment for moderate-to-severe and active Graves' ophthalmopathy, with a large 
proportion of patients having poor efficacy and exposed to the risk of 
glucocorticoids adverse effects. We introduce a novel protocol to develop a 
prediction model designed to identify patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy who 
are not likely to benefit from intravenous glucocorticoids pulse therapy before 
administration, so that these patients can advance the time to receive 
appropriate treatment. Existing prediction models for prognosis of Graves' 
ophthalmopathy have usually focused on traditional clinical indicators without 
adequate consideration of orbital soft tissue changes. Our protocol for model 
development will address this limitation by using artificial intelligence models 
to quantify facial morphological changes.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study is a single-centre, prospective and 
observational study. A sample size of 278 patients with moderate-to-severe and 
active Graves' ophthalmopathy will be prospectively recruited at ophthalmology 
clinic of Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital to collect clinical and artificial 
intelligence model's baseline data as potential variables to develop the 
prediction model. They will receive 12-week intravenous glucocorticoids pulse 
therapy according to the 2021 European Group on Graves' Orbitopathy treatment 
guideline. After standard medication course and following 12-week observation, 
patients will be evaluated for the effectiveness of treatment in our 
ophthalmology clinic and divided into glucocorticoids-sensitive and 
glucocorticoids-insensitive groups. The model will be developed by means of 
multivariate logistic regression to select the best variables for the prediction 
of glucocorticoids treatment efficacy before administration. The result of the 
study will provide evidence for the use of a prediction model to personalise 
treatment options for patients with moderate-to-severe and active Graves' 
ophthalmopathy.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study received approval from the Ethics Committee 
of Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital (ethical approval number: SH9H-2020-T211-1. 
Findings will be disseminated via peer-reviewed publications and conference 
presentations.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of age at pediatric 
arterial ischemic stroke on long-term cognitive outcome in order to identify 
patients particularly at risk for the development of long-term cognitive 
sequelae.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study included patients in the chronic phase of 
stroke (>2 years after stroke) previously diagnosed with neonatal or childhood 
arterial ischemic stroke and a control group. Participants with active epilepsy, 
severe learning difficulties, or behavioral problems hindering the cognitive 
assessment were excluded. Several cognitive domains, including intelligence, 
executive functions (working memory, inhibition, and cognitive flexibility), 
processing speed, memory, letter fluency, and visual-motor skills were assessed 
with neuropsychological tests. Cognitive long-term outcome was compared across 
patients after neonatal stroke (stroke between 0 and 28 days of life), early 
childhood stroke (stroke between 29 days and <6 years), and late childhood 
stroke (stroke between ≥6 and <16 years).
RESULTS: Fifty-two patients after neonatal or childhood arterial ischemic stroke 
(median age 15.3 years, interquartile range [IQR] 10.6-18.7) and 49 healthy 
controls (median age 13.6 years, IQR 9.8-17.2) met the inclusion criteria. 
Cognitive outcome was significantly worse in the pediatric stroke group compared 
to the control group. A nonlinear effect of age at stroke (irrespective of 
lesion size and lesion location) was found for cognitive flexibility, processing 
speed, and verbal learning with early childhood stroke (29 days to <6 years), 
showing significantly worse cognitive outcome compared to neonatal or late 
childhood stroke (p < 0.05, false discovery rate-corrected).
DISCUSSION: Age at stroke is an important factor for poststroke recovery and 
modulates long-term cognitive outcome irrespective of lesion size and lesion 
location. Children after early childhood stroke are at particular risk for 
long-term alterations in cognitive functions.

AIMS: To develop a comprehensive three-dimensional analyses of segmental 
tomography (placido and optical coherence tomography) using artificial 
intelligence (AI).
METHODS: Preoperative imaging data (MS-39, CSO, Italy) of refractive surgery 
patients with stable outcomes and diagnosed with asymmetric or bilateral 
keratoconus (KC) were used. The curvature, wavefront aberrations and thickness 
distributions were analysed with Zernike polynomials (ZP) and a random forest 
(RF) AI model. For training and cross-validation, there were groups of healthy 
(n=527), very asymmetric ectasia (VAE; n=144) and KC (n=454). The VAE eyes were 
the fellow eyes of KC patients but no further manual segregation of these eyes 
into subclinical or forme-fruste was performed.
RESULTS: The AI achieved an excellent area under the curve (0.994), accuracy 
(95.6%), recall (98.5%) and precision (92.7%) for the healthy eyes. For the KC 
eyes, the same were 0.997, 99.1%, 98.7% and 99.1%, respectively. For the VAE 
eyes, the same were 0.976, 95.5%, 71.5% and 91.2%, respectively. Interestingly, 
the AI reclassified 36 (subclinical) of the VAE eyes as healthy though these 
eyes were distinct from healthy eyes. Most of the remaining VAE (n=104; forme 
fruste) eyes retained their classification, and were distinct from both KC and 
healthy eyes. Further, the posterior surface features were not among the highest 
ranked variables by the AI model.
CONCLUSIONS: A universal architecture of combining segmental tomography with ZP 
and AI was developed. It achieved an excellent classification of healthy and KC 
eyes. The AI efficiently classified the VAE eyes as 'subclinical' and 
'forme-fruste'.

AIM: To develop a nomogram based on computed tomography (CT) texture analysis 
for the preoperative prediction of visceral pleural invasion in patients with 
cT1N0M0 lung adenocarcinoma.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A dataset of chest CT containing lung nodules was 
collected from two institutions, and all surgically resected nodules were 
classified pathologically based on the presence of visceral pleural invasion. 
Each nodule on the CT image was segmented automatically by 
artificial-intelligence software and its CT texture features were extracted. The 
dataset was divided into training and external validation cohorts according to 
the institution, and a nomogram for predicting visceral pleural invasion was 
developed and validated.
RESULTS: Of a total of 313 patients enrolled from two independent institutions, 
63 were diagnosed with visceral pleural invasion. Three-dimensional (3D) CT long 
diameter, skewness, and sphericity, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
were identified as independent predictors for visceral pleural invasion by 
multivariable logistic regression. The nomogram based on multivariable logistic 
regression showed great discriminative ability, as indicated by a C-index of 
0.890 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.867-0.914) and 0.864 (95% CI: 
0.817-0.911) for the training and external validation cohorts, respectively. 
Additionally, calibration of the nomogram revealed good predictive ability, as 
indicated by the Brier score (0.108 and 0.100 for the training and external 
validation cohorts, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: A nomogram was developed that could compute the probability of 
visceral pleural invasion in patients with cT1N0M0 lung adenocarcinoma with good 
calibration and discrimination. The nomogram has potential as a reliable tool 
for clinical evaluation and decision-making.

The risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) clinical manifestations and patient 
management is estimated according to risk scores accounting multifactorial risk 
factors, thus failing to cover the individual cardiovascular risk. Technological 
improvements in the field of medical imaging, in particular, in cardiac computed 
tomography angiography and cardiac magnetic resonance protocols, laid the 
development of radiogenomics. Radiogenomics aims to integrate a huge number of 
imaging features and molecular profiles to identify optimal radiomic/biomarker 
signatures. In addition, supervised and unsupervised artificial intelligence 
algorithms have the potential to combine different layers of data (imaging 
parameters and features, clinical variables and biomarkers) and elaborate 
complex and specific CHD risk models allowing more accurate diagnosis and 
reliable prognosis prediction. Literature from the past 5 years was 
systematically collected from PubMed and Scopus databases, and 60 studies were 
selected. We speculated the applicability of radiogenomics and artificial 
intelligence through the application of machine learning algorithms to identify 
CHD and characterize atherosclerotic lesions and myocardial abnormalities. 
Radiomic features extracted by cardiac computed tomography angiography and 
cardiac magnetic resonance showed good diagnostic accuracy for the 
identification of coronary plaques and myocardium structure; on the other hand, 
few studies exploited radiogenomics integration, thus suggesting further 
research efforts in this field. Cardiac computed tomography angiography resulted 
the most used noninvasive imaging modality for artificial intelligence 
applications. Several studies provided high performance for CHD diagnosis, 
classification, and prognostic assessment even though several efforts are still 
needed to validate and standardize algorithms for CHD patient routine according 
to good medical practice.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: There is a consistent body of evidence on the association 
between single nutrients and cognition, but the role of a healthful dietary 
pattern on cognition in children has been seldomly studied. This study aims to 
assess the association between dietary patterns at 4 years (y) and cognitive 
abilities at 10-13y and examine whether adiposity mediated these associations.
METHODS: This study used data from a sub-sample of the population-based birth 
cohort Generation XXI, with complete information on diet and cognition 
(n = 3575). At 4y, data on dietary intake was collected by a validated food 
frequency questionnaire and dietary patterns were derived by latent class 
analysis, namely Energy-dense food (EDF) pattern, Snacking pattern and Healthier 
pattern (Reference). At 10-13y, the Portuguese Version of the Wechsler 
Intelligence Scale for Children®-Third Edition was administered by trained 
psychologists and age-adjusted composite scores were computed: a Full-Scale 
Intelligence Quotient (IQ), plus a Verbal IQ, Performance IQ and Processing 
Speed IQ. Age- and sex-specific body mass index (BMI) z-scores, body fat 
percentage from bioimpedance, and waist-to-weight ratio and waist-to-hip ratio 
were used as measures of adiposity. Regression coefficients and 95% confidence 
intervals (CI) were computed using linear regression models (adjusted for 
maternal age and education, pre-pregnancy BMI, smoking and alcohol intake during 
pregnancy, child's sex, birthweight, exclusive breastfeeding duration and having 
siblings at 4y). Mediation analysis was conducted using path analysis.
RESULTS: After adjustment, children classified in the EDF or a Snacking patterns 
at 4y were more likely to have lower scores on total IQ (β = -0.116; 
95%CI:-0.192,-0.039 and β = -0.148; 95%CI -0.252,-0.044, respectively), Verbal 
IQ (β = -0.104; 95%CI -0.177, -0.031 and β = -0.163; 95%CI -0.262,-0.064, 
respectively) and Performance IQ (β = -0.116 95%CI -0.193,-0.040 and β = -0.147; 
95%CI -0.250,-0.042, respectively) at 10-13y, when compared to those classified 
in the Healthier pattern. None of the adiposity measures seemed to explain the 
associations between dietary patterns and IQ.
CONCLUSION: This study supports that early unhealthy dietary patterns were 
associated with lower child's cognitive ability, but this effect did not seem to 
be mediated by adiposity.

It is suggested that Jumping To Conclusions (JTC) reasoning bias might 
contribute to the distortion of external reality. However, the association 
between psychotic manifestations and JTC is obscure, especially if general 
intelligence is considered as a mediator. The aim of this study is to 
investigate the relation between severity, early clinical improvement and 
remission of symptoms in First Episode Psychosis (FEP) with JTC as an 
explanatory factor. One hundred seventy-one FEP individuals were evaluated with 
the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) at baseline and one month after 
treatment initiation. Clinical improvement was ascribed as symptom change 
one-month post-baseline measurements. Symptomatic remission was assessed with 
the Andreasen severity criteria and JTC with the Beads Task, operationalized 
through Draws To Decision (DTD) (the lower the number of DTD, the higher the JTC 
bias). Regarding symptoms severity, total psychotic, total positive psychotic, 
and hallucinations-item PANSS scores showed a negative association with JTC 
after controlling for IQ. Regarding early clinical improvement, the association 
with JTC was non-significant. No significant association was detected between 
one month remission status of FEP and JTC. Our findings indicate that severity 
of positive symptoms is not associated with hastiness in decision-making, but 
rather with a heightened conservatism in terms of increased data gathering. 
Further research is required to replicate the results and clarify the cognitive 
processes involved.

In response to rising rates of melanoma worldwide, novel noninvasive melanoma 
detection techniques are emerging to facilitate the early detection of melanoma 
and decrease unnecessary biopsies of benign pigmented lesions. Because they 
often report similar study findings, it may be difficult to determine how best 
to incorporate these technologies into clinical practice based on their 
supporting studies alone. The first article in this continuing medical education 
series provides practical advice on how and when to use various noninvasive 
melanoma detection techniques in clinical practice.

Neonates and children in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) 
contribute to the highest number of sepsis-associated deaths globally. 
Interventions to prevent sepsis mortality are hampered by a lack of 
comprehensive epidemiological data and pathophysiological understanding of 
biological pathways. In this review, we discuss the challenges faced by LMICs in 
diagnosing sepsis in these age groups. We highlight a role for multi-omics and 
health care data to improve diagnostic accuracy of clinical algorithms, arguing 
that health-care systems urgently need precision medicine to avoid the pitfalls 
of missed diagnoses, misdiagnoses, and overdiagnoses, and associated 
antimicrobial resistance. We discuss ethical, regulatory, and systemic barriers 
related to the collection and use of big data in LMICs. Technologies such as 
cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and medical tricorders might help, but 
they require collaboration with local communities. Co-partnering (joint equal 
development of technology between producer and end-users) could facilitate 
integration of these technologies as part of future care-delivery systems, 
offering a chance to transform the global management and prevention of sepsis 
for neonates and children.

INTRODUCTION: Cervical cancer remains a major public health challenge in low- 
and middle-income countries (LMICs) due to financial and logistical issues. WHO 
recommendation for cervical cancer screening in LMICs includes HPV testing as 
primary screening followed by visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) and 
treatment. However, VIA is a subjective procedure dependent on the healthcare 
provider's experience. Its accuracy can be improved by computer-aided detection 
techniques. Our aim is to assess the performance of a smartphone-based Automated 
VIA Classifier (AVC) relying on Artificial Intelligence to discriminate 
precancerous and cancerous lesions from normal cervical tissue.
METHODS: The AVC study will be nested in an ongoing cervical cancer screening 
program called "3T-study" (for Test, Triage and Treat), including HPV 
self-sampling followed by VIA triage and treatment if needed. After application 
of acetic acid on the cervix, precancerous and cancerous cells whiten more 
rapidly than non-cancerous ones and their whiteness persists stronger overtime. 
The AVC relies on this key feature to determine whether the cervix is suspect 
for precancer or cancer. In order to train and validate the AVC, 6000 women aged 
30 to 49 years meeting the inclusion criteria will be recruited on a voluntary 
basis, with an estimated 100 CIN2+, calculated using a confidence level of 95% 
and an estimated sensitivity of 90% +/-7% precision on either side. Diagnostic 
test performance of AVC test and two current standard tests (VIA and cytology) 
used routinely for triage will be evaluated and compared. Histopathological 
examination will serve as reference standard. Participants' and providers' 
acceptability of the technology will also be assessed. The study protocol was 
registered under ClinicalTrials.gov (number NCT04859530).
EXPECTED RESULTS: The study will determine whether AVC test can be an effective 
method for cervical cancer screening in LMICs.

BACKGROUND: Over the last decade, mobile health applications (mHealth App) have 
evolved exponentially to assess and support our health and well-being.
OBJECTIVE: This paper presents an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled mHealth 
app rating tool, called ACCU3RATE, which takes multidimensional measures such as 
user star rating, user review and features declared by the developer to generate 
the rating of an app. However, currently, there is very little conceptual 
understanding on how user reviews affect app rating from a multi-dimensional 
perspective. This study applies AI-based text mining technique to develop more 
comprehensive understanding of user feedback based on several important factors, 
determining the mHealth app ratings.
METHOD: Based on the literature, six variables were identified that influence 
the mHealth app rating scale. These factors are user star rating, user text 
review, user interface (UI) design, functionality, security and privacy, and 
clinical approval. Natural Language Toolkit package is used for interpreting 
text and to identify the App users' sentiment. Additional considerations were 
accessibility, protection and privacy, UI design for people living with physical 
disability. Moreover, the details of clinical approval, if exists, were taken 
from the developer's statement. Finally, we fused all the inputs using fuzzy 
logic to calculate the new app rating score.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: ACCU3RATE concentrates on heart related Apps found in 
the play store and App gallery. The findings indicate the efficacy of the 
proposed method as opposed to the current device scale. This study has 
implications for both App developers and consumers who are using mHealth Apps to 
monitor and track their health. The performance evaluation shows that the 
proposed mHealth scale has shown excellent reliability as well as internal 
consistency of the scale, and high inter-rater reliability index. It has also 
been noticed that the fuzzy based rating scale, as in ACCU3RATE, matches more 
closely to the rating performed by experts.

BACKGROUND: Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the United States, 
with >47,000 deaths in 2019. Most people who died by suicide had contact with 
the health care system in the year before their death. Health care provider 
training is a top research priority identified by the National Action Alliance 
for Suicide Prevention; however, evidence-based approaches that target 
skill-building are resource intensive and difficult to implement. Advances in 
artificial intelligence technology hold promise for improving the scalability 
and sustainability of training methods, as it is now possible for computers to 
assess the intervention delivery skills of trainees and provide feedback to 
guide skill improvements. Much remains to be known about how best to integrate 
these novel technologies into continuing education for health care providers.
OBJECTIVE: In Project WISE (Workplace Integrated Support and Education), we aim 
to develop e-learning training in suicide safety planning, enhanced with novel 
skill-building technologies that can be integrated into the routine workflow of 
nurses serving patients hospitalized for medical or surgical reasons or 
traumatic injury. The research aims include identifying strategies for the 
implementation and workflow integration of both the training and safety planning 
with patients, adapting 2 existing technologies to enhance general counseling 
skills for use in suicide safety planning (a conversational agent and an 
artificial intelligence-based feedback system), observing training acceptability 
and nurse engagement with the training components, and assessing the feasibility 
of recruitment, retention, and collection of longitudinal self-report and 
electronic health record data for patients identified as at risk of suicide.
METHODS: Our developmental research includes qualitative and observational 
methods to explore the implementation context and technology usability, 
formative evaluation of the training paradigm, and pilot research to assess the 
feasibility of conducting a future cluster randomized pragmatic trial. The trial 
will examine whether patients hospitalized for medical or surgical reasons or 
traumatic injury who are at risk of suicide have better suicide-related 
postdischarge outcomes when admitted to a unit with nurses trained using the 
skill-building technology than those admitted to a unit with untrained nurses. 
The research takes place at a level 1 trauma center, which is also a safety-net 
hospital and academic medical center.
RESULTS: Project WISE was funded in July 2019. As of September 2021, we have 
completed focus groups and usability testing with 27 acute care and 3 acute and 
intensive care nurses. We began data collection for research aims 3 and 4 in 
November 2021. All research has been approved by the University of Washington 
institutional review board.
CONCLUSIONS: Project WISE aims to further the national agenda to improve suicide 
prevention in health care settings by training nurses in suicide prevention with 
medically hospitalized patients using novel e-learning technologies.

Licensed London taxi drivers have been found to show changes in the gray matter 
density of their hippocampus over the course of training and decades of 
navigation in London (UK). This has been linked to their learning and using of 
the "Knowledge of London," the names and layout of over 26,000 streets and 
thousands of points of interest in London. Here we review past behavioral and 
neuroimaging studies of London taxi drivers, covering the structural differences 
in hippocampal gray matter density and brain dynamics associated with navigating 
London. We examine the process by which they learn the layout of London, 
detailing the key learning steps: systematic study of maps, travel on selected 
overlapping routes, the mental visualization of places and the optimal use of 
subgoals. Our analysis provides the first map of the street network covered by 
the routes used to learn the network, allowing insight into where there are gaps 
in this network. The methods described could be widely applied to aid spatial 
learning in the general population and may provide insights for artificial 
intelligence systems to efficiently learn new environments.

Informal caregivers are key players in maintaining chronically ill patients at 
home but often experience negative consequences such as informal caregiver 
burnout. The processes by which determinants related to informal care and their 
personal and social resources affect the caregiver's risk of burnout remains 
little investigated. Recent theoretical works have suggested that two mediators 
could play an important role in understanding how these risks and resources 
influence informal caregiver burnout: by deteriorating how they view their role 
(caregiving appraisal) and by weakening the relationship with the care-recipient 
(relationship quality). The present study aimed at exploring the impact of the 
care-recipient's dependency (WHODAS), the caregiver's emotional intelligence 
(TEIQue-SF), and loneliness (UCLALS) on informal caregiver burnout (MBI-ICg). 
This association was explored both directly and through the mediation of 
caregiving appraisal (measured by subjective burden, ZBI) and relationship 
quality. To do so, a sample of 444 French-speaking informal caregivers completed 
online questionnaires from November 2017 to August 2018. Structural equation 
modelling (SEM) was performed to test the mediation model. As a result, the 
caregiving appraisal appears as a key mediator between determinants and informal 
caregiver burnout, whereas the relationship quality had a lower predictive 
value. Among the determinants, emotional intelligence was the strongest 
protective factor and the care-recipient's dependency was the strongest risk 
factor. But beyond this association, the perception informal caregivers have of 
their role (their caregiving appraisal) is a key mediator between these 
determinants and informal caregiver burnout, which emphasizes the importance of 
subjectivity in building risk and protective profiles.

Purpose: To gauge the level of interest in breast imaging (BI) and determine 
factors impacting trainees' decision to pursue this subspecialty. Methods: 
Canadian radiology residents and medical students were surveyed from November 
2020 to February 2021. Training level, actual vs preferred timing of breast 
rotations, fellowship choices, perceptions of BI, and how artificial 
intelligence (AI) will impact BI were collected. Chi-square, Fisher's exact 
tests and univariate logistic regression were performed to determine the impact 
of trainees' perceptions on interest in pursuing BI/women's imaging (WI) 
fellowships. Results: 157 responses from 80 radiology residents and 77 medical 
students were collected. The top 3 fellowship subspecialties desired by 
residents were BI/WI (36%), abdominal imaging (35%), and interventional 
radiology (25%). Twenty-five percent of the medical students were unsure due to 
lack of exposure. The most common reason that trainees found BI unappealing was 
repetitiveness (20%), which was associated with lack of interest in BI/WI 
fellowships (OR = 3.9, 95% CI: 1.6-9.5, P = .002). The most common reason 
residents found BI appealing was procedures (59%), which was associated with 
interest in BI/WI fellowships (OR, 3.2, 95% CI, 1.2-8.6, P = .02). Forty percent 
of residents reported an earlier start of their first breast rotation (PGY1-2) 
would affect their fellowship choice. Conclusion: This study assessed the 
current level of Canadian trainees' interest in BI and identified factors that 
influenced their decisions to pursue BI. Solutions for increased interest 
include earlier exposure to breast radiology and addressing inadequacies in 
residency training.

This paper combines echocardiographic signal processing and artificial 
intelligence technology to propose a deep neural network model adapted to 
echocardiographic signals to achieve left atrial volume measurement and 
automatic assessment of pulmonary veins efficiently and quickly. Based on the 
echocardiographic signal generation mechanism and detection method, an 
experimental scheme for the echocardiographic signal acquisition was designed. 
The echocardiographic signal data of healthy subjects were measured in four 
different experimental states, and a database of left atrial volume measurements 
and pulmonary veins was constructed. Combining the correspondence between ECG 
signals and echocardiographic signals in the time domain, a series of 
preprocessing such as denoising, feature point localization, and segmentation of 
the cardiac cycle was realized by wavelet transform and threshold method to 
complete the data collection. This paper proposes a comparative model based on 
artificial intelligence, adapts to the characteristics of one-dimensional 
time-series echocardiographic signals, automatically extracts the deep features 
of echocardiographic signals, effectively reduces the subjective influence of 
manual feature selection, and realizes the automatic classification and 
evaluation of human left atrial volume measurement and pulmonary veins under 
different states. The experimental results show that the proposed BP neural 
network model has good adaptability and classification performance in the tasks 
of LV volume measurement and pulmonary vein automatic classification evaluation 
and achieves an average test accuracy of over 96.58%. The average 
root-mean-square error percentage of signal compression is only 0.65% by 
extracting the coding features of the original echocardiographic signal through 
the convolutional autoencoder, which completes the signal compression with low 
loss. Comparing the training time and classification accuracy of the LSTM 
network with the original signal and encoded features, the experimental results 
show that the AI model can greatly reduce the model training time cost and 
achieve an average accuracy of 97.97% in the test set and increase the real-time 
performance of the left atrial volume measurement and pulmonary vein evaluation 
as well as the security of the data transmission process, which is very 
important for the comparison of left atrial volume measurement and pulmonary 
vein. It is of great practical importance to compare left atrial volume 
measurements with pulmonary veins.

With the development of artificial intelligence, big data classification 
technology provides the advantageous help for the medicine auxiliary diagnosis 
research. While due to the different conditions in the different sample 
collection, the medical big data is often imbalanced. The class-imbalance 
problem has been reported as a serious obstacle to the classification 
performance of many standard learning algorithms. SMOTE algorithm could be used 
to generate sample points randomly to improve imbalance rate, but its 
application is affected by the marginalization generation and blindness of 
parameter selection. Focusing on this problem, an improved SMOTE algorithm based 
on Normal distribution is proposed in this paper, so that the new sample points 
are distributed closer to the center of the minority sample with a higher 
probability to avoid the marginalization of the expanded data. Experiments show 
that the classification effect is better when use proposed algorithm to expand 
the imbalanced dataset of Pima, WDBC, WPBC, Ionosphere and 
Breast-cancer-wisconsin than the original SMOTE algorithm. In addition, the 
parameter selection of the proposed algorithm is analyzed and it is found that 
the classification effect is the best when the distribution characteristics of 
the original data was maintained best by selecting appropriate parameters in our 
designed experiments.

To accelerate cancer research that correlates biomarkers with clinical 
endpoints, methods are needed to ascertain outcomes from electronic health 
records at scale. Here, we train deep natural language processing (NLP) models 
to extract outcomes for participants with any of 7 solid tumors in a precision 
oncology study. Outcomes are extracted from 305,151 imaging reports for 13,130 
patients and 233,517 oncologist notes for 13,511 patients, including patients 
with 6 additional cancer types. NLP models recapitulate outcome annotation from 
these documents, including the presence of cancer, progression/worsening, 
response/improvement, and metastases, with excellent discrimination 
(AUROC > 0.90). Models generalize to cancers excluded from training and yield 
outcomes correlated with survival. Among patients receiving checkpoint 
inhibitors, we confirm that high tumor mutation burden is associated with 
superior progression-free survival ascertained using NLP. Here, we show that 
deep NLP can accelerate annotation of molecular cancer datasets with clinically 
meaningful endpoints to facilitate discovery.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether artificial intelligence (AI) can generate 
plausible and engaging titles for potential Christmas research articles in The 
BMJ.
DESIGN: Observational study.
SETTING: Europe, Australia, and Africa.
PARTICIPANTS: 1 AI technology (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3, GPT-3) and 
25 humans.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Plausibility, attractiveness, enjoyability, and 
educational value of titles for potential Christmas research articles in The BMJ 
generated by GPT-3 compared with historical controls.
RESULTS: AI generated titles were rated at least as enjoyable (159/250 responses 
(64%) v 346/500 responses (69%); odds ratio 0.9, 95% confidence interval 0.7 to 
1.2) and attractive (176/250 (70%) v 342/500 (68%); 1.1, 0.8 to 1.4) as real 
control titles, although the real titles were rated as more plausible (182/250 
(73%) v 238/500 (48%); 3.1, 2.3 to 4.1). The AI generated titles overall were 
rated as having less scientific or educational merit than the real controls 
(146/250 (58%) v 193/500 (39%); 2.0, 1.5 to 2.6); this difference, however, 
became non-significant when humans curated the AI output (146/250 (58%) v 
123/250 (49%); 1.3, 1.0 to 1.8). Of the AI generated titles, the most plausible 
was "The association between belief in conspiracy theories and the willingness 
to receive vaccinations," and the highest rated was "The effects of free gourmet 
coffee on emergency department waiting times: an observational study."
CONCLUSIONS: AI can generate plausible, entertaining, and scientifically 
interesting titles for potential Christmas research articles in The BMJ; as in 
other areas of medicine, performance was enhanced by human intervention.

Basic foundations of artificial intelligence (AI) include analyzing large 
amounts of data, recognizing patterns, and predicting outcomes. At the core of 
AI are well-defined areas, such as machine learning, natural language 
processing, artificial neural networks, and computer vision. Although research 
and development of AI in health care is being conducted in many medical 
subspecialties, only a few applications have been implemented in clinical 
practice. This is true in vascular surgery, where applications are mostly in the 
translational research stage. These AI applications are being evaluated in the 
realms of vascular diagnostics, perioperative medicine, risk stratification, and 
outcome prediction, among others. Apart from the technical challenges of AI and 
research outcomes on safe and beneficial use in patient care, ethical issues and 
policy surrounding AI will present future challenges for its successful 
implementation. This review will give a brief overview and a basic understanding 
of AI and summarize the currently available and used clinical AI applications in 
vascular surgery.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is the next great advance informing medical 
science. Several disciplines, including vascular surgery, use AI-based 
decision-making tools to improve clinical performance. Although applied widely, 
AI functions best when confronted with voluminous, accurate data. Consistent, 
predictable analytic technique selection also challenges researchers. This 
article contextualizes AI analyses within evidence-based medicine, focusing on 
"big data" and health services research, as well as discussing opportunities to 
improve data collection and realize AI's promise.

Vascular anastomoses typically involve a handsewn technique requiring 
significant surgical training, expertise, and time. The aim of our systematic 
review was to identify and describe sutureless vascular anastomosis techniques. 
We performed a systematic review of all sutureless vascular anastomosis 
technologies published in MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane, Web of 
Science, and Scopus Library databases and a patent review using US Patent and 
Trade Office Application, US Patent and Trademark Office Patent, Google Patents, 
Lens, Patent Quality Through Artificial Intelligence, SureChEMBL, and E-Space 
Net. Data from inclusion studies and patents published between January 1, 1980 
and July 15, 2021 were abstracted to describe their category, anastomosis type 
and configuration, study types, and advantages and disadvantages encountered 
with each technology. Two hundred eleven original studies and 475 patents 
describing sutureless vascular anastomosis technologies were identified. In the 
literature, stents/stent-grafts/grafts (n = 61), lasers (n = 53), and couplers 
(n = 27) were the predominant device categories. In the patent review, adhesive 
technologies (n = 103), stents/stent-grafts/grafts (n = 68), and mechanical 
connectors (n = 61) predominated. The majority of studies involved in vivo 
animal studies (n = 193); 32.2% (n = 68) of investigations involved human 
trials; and 17.9% (n = 85) of patent technologies were approved by the US Food 
and Drug Administration. The main advantages described for sutureless 
anastomosis technologies included faster procedure time and greater patency 
rates compared with handsewn anastomoses. The main disadvantages included 
reduced vessel compliance, stenosis, leakage, and device costs. The appeal of 
sutureless technology is substantiated by numerous animal trials, but their use 
in humans remains limited. This may be a reflection of strict regulatory 
criteria and/or vascular complications associated with currently available 
technologies.

The field of vascular surgery is constantly evolving and is unsurpassed in its 
innovation and adoption of new technologies. Endovascular therapy has 
fundamentally changed the treatment paradigms for aneurysm and occlusive 
disease. As we continue to make advances in not only endovascular therapy, but 
also robotic surgery, artificial intelligence, and minimally invasive surgery, 
it is important that the vascular community stay at the forefront. Topics 
include the advantages of laparoscopic and robotic surgery over open surgery for 
aortic procedures, robotic versus laparoscopic aortic surgery, patient candidacy 
for robotic-assisted aortic surgery, and how to increase training and adoption 
of robotic-assisted laparoscopic aortic surgery. Future growth includes the 
development of new platforms and technologies, creation and validation of 
curriculum and virtual simulators, and conduction of randomized clinical trials 
to determine the best applications of robotics in vascular surgery.

OBJECTIVES: To study the effect of levothyroxine sodium tablets on the growth 
and development and thyroid function in preterm infants with thyroid 
dysfunction.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed for 82 preterm infants who were 
born in the Department of Obstetrics of the First People's Hospital of Yunnan 
Province, from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2017, and these infants were 
hospitalized after birth in the Department of Neonatology of the hospital. They 
were regularly followed up to observe growth and development and thyroid 
function at the outpatient service of the Department of Neonatology. According 
to thyroid function test results, they were divided into an abnormal thyroid 
function group (observation group; n=31) and a normal thyroid function group 
(control group; n=51). The infants in the observation group were given oral 
administration of levothyroxine sodium tablets, while those in the control group 
were not given any treatment. The two groups were compared in terms of the 
physical and intelligence development and thyroid function of preterm infants 
with various gestational ages (28-<32 weeks, 32-<34 weeks, and 34-<37 weeks) 
after regular follow-up to the corrected age of 12 months.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in physical development indices 
(body length, body weight, and head circumference) between the observation and 
control groups at various gestational ages after follow-up to the corrected age 
of 12 months (P>0.05). There were no significant differences between the two 
groups in the scores of each functional area of the Gesell Developmental Scale 
among the preterm infants with a gestational age of 28-<32 weeks and 32-<34 
weeks after follow-up to the corrected age of 12 months (P>0.05). For the 
preterm infants with a gestational age of 34-<37 weeks, compared with the 
control group, the observation group had a significantly lower score of gross 
motor ability at the age of 3 and 12 months, significantly lower scores of fine 
motor ability, language ability, and adaptation ability at the age of 12 months 
(P<0.05), and a significantly lower score of personal-social ability at the age 
of 3 months (P<0.05). However, the score of personal-social ability in the 
observation group was not significantly different from the control group at the 
age of 12 months (P>0.05). After 2-4 weeks of treatment with levothyroxine 
sodium tablets, the thyroid function of the 31 preterm infants with thyroid 
dysfunction returned to normal. Among the 31 infants, 21 (68%) achieved complete 
drug withdrawal, with normal results of neonatal screening (100%); 10 infants 
(32%) failed to achieve drug withdrawal, and only 2 (20%) out of the 10 infants 
had normal neonatal screening results (P<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Early diagnosis and reasonable treatment can reduce the impact on 
growth and development in preterm infants with thyroid dysfunction. Most preterm 
infants tend to have transient thyroid dysfunction, while those with positive 
results of neonatal screening are more likely to develop permanent thyroid 
dysfunction.

BACKGROUND: Left atrial (LA) myopathy is common in patients with heart failure 
and preserved ejection fraction and leads to the development of atrial 
fibrillation (AF). We investigated whether the likelihood of LA remodeling, LA 
dysfunction, altered hemodynamics, and risk for incident AF could be identified 
from a single 12-lead ECG using a novel artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled ECG 
analysis.
METHODS: Patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction (n=613) 
underwent AI-enabled ECG analysis, echocardiography, and cardiac 
catheterization. Individuals were grouped by AI-enabled ECG probability of 
contemporaneous AF, taken as an indicator of underlying LA myopathy.
RESULTS: Structural heart disease was more severe in patients with higher 
AI-probability of AF, with more left ventricular hypertrophy, larger LA volumes, 
and lower LA reservoir and booster strain. Cardiac filling pressures and 
pulmonary artery pressures were higher in patients with higher AI-probability, 
while cardiac output reserve was more impaired during exercise. Among patients 
with sinus rhythm and no prior AF, each 10% increase in AI-probability was 
associated with a 31% greater risk of developing new-onset AF (hazard ratio, 
1.31 [95% CI, 1.20-1.42]; P<0.001). In the population as a whole, each 10% 
increase in AI-probability was associated with a 12% greater risk of death 
(hazard ratio, 1.12 [95% CI, 1.08-1.17]; P<0.001) during long-term follow-up, 
which was no longer significant after adjustments for baseline characteristics.
CONCLUSIONS: A novel AI-enabled score derived from a single 12-lead ECG 
identifies the presence of underlying LA myopathy in patients with heart failure 
and preserved ejection fraction as evidenced by structural, functional, and 
hemodynamic abnormalities, as well as long-term risk for incident AF. Further 
research is required to determine the role of the AI-enabled ECG in the 
evaluation and care of patients with heart failure and preserved ejection 
fraction.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term sequelae and 
cognitive profiles resulting from severe hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) 
with central nervous system (CNS) involvement.
METHODS: 294 HFMD cases were included in a retrospective follow-up study. 
Physical examinations were conducted. The Chinese Wechsler Preschool and Primary 
Scale of Intelligence, Fourth Edition (WPPSI-IV) was used to assess 
intelligence.
RESULTS: 58 mild HFMD cases and 99 severe HFMD cases with mild CNS involvement 
did not present any neurological sequelae. In comparison, the sequelae incidence 
for severe HFMD with more severe CNS complications was 50.0%. The proportion of 
full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) impairment was 45.0%. In the 2:6-3:11 
age group, severe HFMD with more severe CNS complications and lower maternal 
education level were risk factors for verbal comprehension disorder. Urban-rural 
residence and lower paternal education level were risk factors for FSIQ 
disorder. Furthermore, in the 4:0-6:11 age group, severe HFMD with more severe 
CNS complication was a risk factor for visual spatial disorder and fluid 
reasoning disorder. Lower paternal education level was a risk factor for FSIQ 
disorder.
CONCLUSION: Early assessment and intervention among severe HFMD patients with 
more severe CNS involvement at a very young age will prove beneficial for their 
future performance.

PURPOSE: There is a need for an improved understanding of clinical and biologic 
risk factors in pediatric cancer to improve patient outcomes. Machine learning 
(ML) represents the application of computational inference from advanced 
statistical methods that can be applied to increasing amount of data available 
for study in pediatric oncology. The goal of this systematic review was to 
systematically characterize the state of ML in pediatric oncology and highlight 
advances and opportunities in the field.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the Embase, Scopus, and MEDLINE 
databases for applications of ML in pediatric oncology. Query results from all 
three databases were aggregated and duplicate studies were removed.
RESULTS: A total of 42 unique articles that examined the applications of ML in 
pediatric oncology met inclusion criteria for review. We identified 20 studies 
of CNS tumors, 13 of solid tumors, and nine of leukemia. ML tasks included 
classification, prediction of treatment response, and dose optimization with a 
variety of methods being used including neural network, k-nearest neighbor, 
random forest, naive Bayes, and support vector machines. Strengths of the 
identified studies included matching or outperforming physician comparators via 
automated analysis and predicting therapeutic response. Common limitations 
included significant heterogeneity in reporting standards, clinical 
applicability, small sample sizes, and missing external validation cohorts.
CONCLUSION: We identified areas where ML can enhance clinical care in ways that 
may not otherwise be achievable. Although ML promises enormous potential in 
improving diagnostics, decision making, and monitoring for children with cancer, 
the field remains in early stages and future work will be aided by standards and 
guidelines to ensure rigorous methodologic design and maximizing clinical 
utility.

Archaea can produce special cellular components such as polyhydroxyalkanoates, 
carotenoids, rhodopsin, and ether lipids, which have valuable applications in 
medicine and green energy production. Most of the archaeal species are 
uncultivated, posing challenges to investigating their biomarker components and 
biochemical properties. In this study, we applied Raman spectroscopy to examine 
the biological characteristics of nine archaeal isolates, including halophilic 
archaea (Haloferax larsenii, Haloarcula argentinensis, Haloferax mediterranei, 
Halomicrobium mukohataei, Halomicrobium salinus, Halorussus sp., Natrinema 
gari), thermophilic archaea (Sulfolobus acidocaldarius), and marine group I 
(MGI) archaea (Nitrosopumilus maritimus). Linear discriminant analysis of the 
Raman spectra allowed visualization of significant separations among the nine 
archaeal isolates. Machine-learning classification models based on support 
vector machine achieved accuracies of 88-100% when classifying the nine archaeal 
species. The predicted results were validated by DNA sequencing analysis of 
cells isolated from the mixture by Raman-activated cell sorting. Raman spectra 
of uncultured archaea (MGII) were also obtained based on Raman spectroscopy and 
fluorescence in situ hybridization. The results combining multiple Raman-based 
techniques indicated that MGII may have the ability to produce lipids distinct 
from other archaeal species. Our study provides a valuable approach for 
investigating and classifying archaea, especially uncultured species, at the 
single-cell level.

PURPOSE: Computational approaches have been used at different stages of drug 
development with the purpose of decreasing the time and cost of conventional 
experimental procedures. Lately, techniques mainly developed and applied in the 
field of artificial intelligence (AI), have been transferred to different 
application domains such as biomedicine.
METHODS: In this study, we conducted an investigative analysis via data-driven 
evaluation of potential hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) therapeutics in the 
context of AI-assisted drug discovery/repurposing. First, we discussed basic 
concepts, computational approaches, databases, modeling approaches, and 
featurization techniques in drug discovery/repurposing. In the analysis part, we 
automatically integrated HCC-related biological entities such as genes/proteins, 
pathways, phenotypes, drugs/compounds, and other diseases with similar 
implications, and represented these heterogeneous relationships via a knowledge 
graph using the CROssBAR system.
RESULTS: Following the system-level evaluation and selection of critical 
genes/proteins and pathways to target, our deep learning-based 
drug/compound-target protein interaction predictors DEEPScreen and MDeePred have 
been employed for predicting new bioactive drugs and compounds for these 
critical targets. Finally, we embedded ligands of selected HCC-associated 
proteins which had a significant enrichment with the CROssBAR system into a 2-D 
space to identify and repurpose small molecule inhibitors as potential drug 
candidates based on their molecular similarities to known HCC drugs.
CONCLUSIONS: We expect that these series of data-driven analyses can be used as 
a roadmap to propose early-stage potential inhibitors (from database-scale sets 
of compounds) to both HCC and other complex diseases, which may subsequently be 
analyzed with more targeted in silico and experimental approaches.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new type of respiratory disease that 
has been announced as a pandemic. The COVID-19 outbreak has changed the way we 
live. It has also changed the food service industry. This study aimed to 
identify trends in the food and food service industry after the COVID-19 
outbreak and suggest research themes induced by industry trends. This study 
investigated the industry and academic information on the food and food service 
industry and societal trends resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak. The most 
noticeable changes in the food industry include the explosive increase in home 
meal replacement, meal-kit consumption, online orders, take-out, and 
drive-through. The adoption of technologies, including robots and artificial 
intelligence, has also been noted. Such industry trends are discussed in this 
paper from a research perspective, including consumer, employee, and 
organizational strategy perspectives. This study reviews the changes in the food 
service industry after COVID-19 and the implications that these changes have 
rendered to academia. The paper concludes with future expectations that would 
come in the era of COVID-19.

Newborn Eye Screening as an Application of AI.

Kumm J.

Artificial intelligence (AI) applications are diverse and serve varied functions 
in clinical practice. The most successful products today are clinical decision 
tools used by physicians, but autonomous AI is gaining traction. Widespread use 
of AI is limited in part because of concerns about bias, fault-tolerance, and 
specificity. Adoption of AI often depends on removing cost and complexity in 
clinical workflow integration, providing clear incentives for use, and providing 
clear demonstration of clinical outcome. Existing wide-angle photographic 
screening could be integrated into the clinical workflow based on prior 
implementations for premature babies and linked with AI interpretation with 
existing technology. Incidence of retinal abnormality, clinical considerations, 
AI performance, grading variation for AI-augmented human grading, and cost and 
policy aspects play a significant role. Improved outcomes for newborns and a 
relatively high estimated incidence of abnormality have been named as benefits 
to counterweigh costs in the long term. [Ophthalmic Surg Lasers Imaging Retina. 
2021;52:S17-S22.].

Numerous emerging applications in modern society require humidity sensors that 
are not only sensitive and specific but also durable and intelligent. However, 
conventional humidity sensors do not have all of these simultaneously because 
they require very different or even contradictory design principles. Here, 
inspired by camel noses, we develop a porous zwitterionic capacitive humidity 
sensor. Relying on the synergistic effect of a porous structure and good 
chemical and thermal stabilities of hygroscopic zwitterions, this sensor 
simultaneously exhibits high sensitivity, discriminability, excellent 
durability, and, in particular, the highest respond speed among reported 
capacitive humidity sensors, with demonstrated applications in the fast 
discrimination between fresh, stale, and dry leaves, high-resolution touchless 
human-machine interactive input devices, and the real-time monitoring humidity 
level of a hot industrial exhaust. More importantly, this sensor exhibits 
typical synapse behaviors such as paired-pulse facilitation due to the strong 
binding interactions between water and zwitterions. This leads to learning and 
forgetting features with a tunable memory, thus giving the sensor artificial 
intelligence and enabling the location of water sources. This work offers a 
general design principle expected to be applied to develop other 
high-performance biochemical sensors and the next-generation intelligent sensors 
with much broader applications.

Table2Vec-automated universal representation learning of enterprise data DNA for 
benchmarkable and explainable enterprise data science.

Enterprise data typically involves multiple heterogeneous data sources and 
external data that respectively record business activities, transactions, 
customer demographics, status, behaviors, interactions and communications with 
the enterprise, and the consumption and feedback of its products, services, 
production, marketing, operations, and management, etc. They involve enterprise 
DNA associated with domain-oriented transactions and master data, informational 
and operational metadata, and relevant external data. A critical challenge in 
enterprise data science is to enable an effective 'whole-of-enterprise' data 
understanding and data-driven discovery and decision-making on all-round 
enterprise DNA. Accordingly, here we introduce a neural encoder Table2Vec for 
automated universal representation learning of entities such as customers from 
all-round enterprise DNA with automated data characteristics analysis and data 
quality augmentation. The learned universal representations serve as 
representative and benchmarkable enterprise data genomes (similar to biological 
genomes and DNA in organisms) and can be used for enterprise-wide and 
domain-specific learning tasks. Table2Vec integrates automated universal 
representation learning on low-quality enterprise data and downstream learning 
tasks. Such automated universal enterprise representation and learning cannot be 
addressed by existing enterprise data warehouses (EDWs), business intelligence 
and corporate analytics systems, where 'enterprise big tables' are constructed 
with reporting and analytics conducted by specific analysts on respective domain 
subjects and goals. It addresses critical limitations and gaps of existing 
representation learning, enterprise analytics and cloud analytics, which are 
analytical subject, task and data-specific, creating analytical silos in an 
enterprise. We illustrate Table2Vec in characterizing all-round customer data 
DNA in an enterprise on complex heterogeneous multi-relational big tables to 
build universal customer vector representations. The learned universal 
representation of each customer is all-round, representative and benchmarkable 
to support both enterprise-wide and domain-specific learning goals and tasks in 
enterprise data science. Table2Vec significantly outperforms the existing 
shallow, boosting and deep learning methods typically used for enterprise 
analytics. We further discuss the research opportunities, directions and 
applications of automated universal enterprise representation and learning and 
the learned enterprise data DNA for automated, all-purpose, whole-of-enterprise 
and ethical machine learning and data science.

While active efforts are advancing medical artificial intelligence (AI) model 
development and clinical translation, safety issues of the AI models emerge, but 
little research has been done. We perform a study to investigate the behaviors 
of an AI diagnosis model under adversarial images generated by Generative 
Adversarial Network (GAN) models and to evaluate the effects on human experts 
when visually identifying potential adversarial images. Our GAN model makes 
intentional modifications to the diagnosis-sensitive contents of mammogram 
images in deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) of breast cancer. 
In our experiments the adversarial samples fool the AI-CAD model to output a 
wrong diagnosis on 69.1% of the cases that are initially correctly classified by 
the AI-CAD model. Five breast imaging radiologists visually identify 29%-71% of 
the adversarial samples. Our study suggests an imperative need for continuing 
research on medical AI model's safety issues and for developing potential 
defensive solutions against adversarial attacks.

INTRODUCTION: Sentiment analysis, by evaluating written wording and its context, 
is a growing tool used in computer science that can determine the level of 
support expressed in a body of text using artificial intelligence methodologies. 
The application of sentiment analysis to biomedical literature is a growing 
field and offers the potential to rapidly and economically explore large amounts 
of published research and characterize treatment efficacy.
METHODS: We compared the results of sentiment analysis of 115 article abstracts 
analyzed in a recently published meta-analysis of peripheral nerve block usage 
in primary hip and knee arthroplasty to the conclusions drawn by the authors of 
the original meta-analysis.
RESULTS: A moderately positive outlook supporting the utilization of regional 
anesthesia for hip and knee arthroplasty was found in the 115 articles that were 
included for analysis, with 46% expressing positive sentiment, 35% expressing 
neutral sentiment, and 19% of abstracts expressing negative sentiment. This was 
well aligned with the conclusions reached by a previous meta-analysis of the 
same articles.
DISCUSSION: Sentiment analysis applied to the medical literature can rapidly 
evaluate large collections of published data and generate an impression of 
overall findings that are aligned with the findings of a traditional 
meta-analysis.

Artificial intelligence in healthcare refers to the use of complex algorithms 
designed to conduct certain tasks in an automated manner. Artificial 
intelligence has a transformative power in radiation oncology to improve the 
quality and efficiency of patient care, given the increase in volume and 
complexity of digital data, as well as the multi-faceted and highly technical 
nature of this field of medicine. However, artificial intelligence alone will 
not be able to fix healthcare's problem, because new technologies bring 
unexpected and potentially underappreciated obstacles. The inclusion of 
multicentre datasets, the incorporation of time-varying data, the assessment of 
missing data as well as informative censoring and the addition of clinical 
utility could significantly improve artificial intelligence models. 
Standardisation plays a crucial, supportive and leading role in artificial 
intelligence. Clinical trials are the most reliable method of demonstrating the 
efficacy and safety of a treatment or clinical approach, as well as providing 
high-level evidence to justify artificial intelligence. The National Surgical 
Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project, the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group and the 
Gynecologic Oncology Group collaborated to form NRG Oncology (acronym NRG 
derived from the names of the parental groups). NRG Oncology is one of the adult 
cancer clinical trial groups containing radiotherapy specialty of the National 
Cancer Institute's Clinical Trials Network (NCTN). Standardisation from NRG/NCTN 
has the potential to reduce variation in clinical treatment and patient outcome 
by eliminating potential errors, enabling broader application of artificial 
intelligence tools. NCTN, NRG and Imaging and Radiation Oncology Core are in a 
unique position to help with standards development, advocacy and enforcement, 
all of which can benefit from artificial intelligence, as artificial 
intelligence has the ability to improve trial success rates by transforming 
crucial phases in clinical trial design, from study planning through to 
execution. Here we will examine: (i) how to conduct technical and clinical 
evaluations before adopting artificial intelligence technologies, (ii) how to 
obtain high-quality data for artificial intelligence, (iii) the NCTN 
infrastructure and standards, (iv) radiotherapy standardisation for clinical 
trials and (v) artificial intelligence applications in standardisation.

Computational chemistry and structure-based design have traditionally been 
viewed as a subset of tools that could aid acceleration of the drug discovery 
process, but were not commonly regarded as a driving force in small molecule 
drug discovery. In the last decade however, there have been dramatic advances in 
the field, including (1) development of physics-based computational approaches 
to accurately predict a broad variety of endpoints from potency to solubility, 
(2) improvements in artificial intelligence and deep learning methods and (3) 
dramatic increases in computational power with the advent of GPUs and cloud 
computing, resulting in the ability to explore and accurately profile vast 
amounts of drug-like chemical space in silico. There have also been simultaneous 
advancements in structural biology such as cryogenic electron microscopy 
(cryo-EM) and computational protein-structure prediction, allowing for access to 
many more high-resolution 3D structures of novel drug-receptor complexes. The 
convergence of these breakthroughs has positioned structurally-enabled 
computational methods to be a driving force behind the discovery of novel small 
molecule therapeutics. This review will give a broad overview of the synergies 
in recent advances in the fields of computational chemistry, machine learning 
and structural biology, in particular in the areas of hit identification, 
hit-to-lead, and lead optimization.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common medical problem in hospitalised patients 
worldwide that may result in negative physiological, social and economic 
consequences. Amongst patients admitted to ICU with AKI, over 40% have had 
either elective or emergency surgery prior to admission. Predicting outcomes 
after AKI is difficult and the decision on whom to initiate RRT with a goal of 
renal recovery or predict a long-term survival benefit still poses a challenge 
for acute care physicians. With the increasing use of electronic healthcare 
records, artificial intelligence may allow postoperative AKI prognostication and 
aid clinical management. Patients will benefit if the data can be 
readily accessed andregulatory, ethical and human factors challenges can be 
overcome.

This study reviews recent advances on the application of artificial intelligence 
for the early diagnosis of various maternal-fetal conditions such as preterm 
birth and abnormal fetal growth. It is found in this study that various machine 
learning methods have been successfully employed for different kinds of data 
capture with regard to early diagnosis of maternal-fetal conditions. With the 
more popular use of artificial intelligence, ethical issues should also be 
considered accordingly.

The electronic vaccine intelligence network (eVIN) was introduced by India's 
Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in 12 states and was implemented by the 
United Nations Development Programme through the Gavi health system 
strengthening support during 2014-17 to replace the traditional paper-based 
cold-chain management system with an electronic vaccine logistics management 
system. An economic assessment was conducted as part of the overall assessment 
of eVIN. The objective of the economic assessment was to conduct a return on 
investment analysis of eVIN implementation. Return on investment was defined as 
the ratio of total benefits (savings) from eVIN to total investment in eVIN. All 
costs were calculated in 2020 prices and reported in Indian rupees (1 US 
dollar = INR 74.132). A one-rupee investment in eVIN led to a return of INR 0.52 
for traditional vaccines. The highest cost savings from eVIN was from better 
vaccine stock management. When same percentage of savings from the new vaccines 
were incorporated into the analysis, one-rupee investment in eVIN led to a 
return of INR 1.41. In the future, when only recurrent costs will exist, the 
return from eVIN will be even higher: a one-rupee investment in eVIN will yield 
a return of INR 2.93. The assessment of eVIN showed promising results in 
streamlining the vaccine flow network and ensuring equity in vaccine stock 
management along with good return on investment; hence, there was a rapid 
expansion of eVIN in all 731 districts across 36 states and union territories in 
the country.

Chain and derivative of Gaussian.

The human vision system can extract a stable representation of the 
always-changing visual world. However, the mechanism underlying such perceptual 
continuity remains unclear. A possible candidate is the serial dependence: 
visual perception of an object is positively biased toward the visual input from 
the recent past. Does the visual system use one pattern of serial dependence for 
general purposes? Or different patterns of serial dependence for different 
visual tasks? Because different social facial traits (e.g., trustworthiness and 
dominance) are dissociable, it is reasonable to assume that the perception of 
different facial characteristics would require different patterns of serial 
dependences. In this study, we examine the existence and the similarities of the 
serial dependence(s) in the evaluation of seven facial characteristics (i.e., 
attractiveness, trustworthiness, confidence, dominance, intelligence, age, and 
aggressiveness). The convergent evidence from conventional Derivative of 
Gaussian fitting and Markov Chain modeling demonstrated that (1) serial 
dependence exists in judgments of all seven social facial characteristic, (2) 
the serial dependences of them are highly similar, and (3) the serial dependence 
follows the efficient coding. Thus it is highly possible that there exists a 
general serial dependence mechanism for (at least high-level) vision processing. 
Moreover, we used the Markov Chain modeling to better describe the transitional 
pattern of serial dependence, which is a kind of Markov process. These findings 
may shed light on future works regarding serial dependence, as well as face 
perception.

BACKGROUND: Interpretation of capsule endoscopy images or movies is 
operator-dependent and time-consuming. As a result, computer-aided diagnosis 
(CAD) has been applied to enhance the efficacy and accuracy of the review 
process. Two previous meta-analyses reported the diagnostic performance of CAD 
models for gastrointestinal ulcers or hemorrhage in capsule endoscopy. However, 
insufficient systematic reviews have been conducted, which cannot determine the 
real diagnostic validity of CAD models.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic test accuracy of CAD models for 
gastrointestinal ulcers or hemorrhage using wireless capsule endoscopic images.
METHODS: We conducted core databases searching for studies based on CAD models 
for the diagnosis of ulcers or hemorrhage using capsule endoscopy and presenting 
data on diagnostic performance. Systematic review and diagnostic test accuracy 
meta-analysis were performed.
RESULTS: Overall, 39 studies were included. The pooled area under the curve, 
sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio of CAD models for the 
diagnosis of ulcers (or erosions) were .97 (95% confidence interval, .95-.98), 
.93 (.89-.95), .92 (.89-.94), and 138 (79-243), respectively. The pooled area 
under the curve, sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio of CAD 
models for the diagnosis of hemorrhage (or angioectasia) were .99 (.98-.99), .96 
(.94-0.97), .97 (.95-.99), and 888 (343-2303), respectively. Subgroup analyses 
showed robust results. Meta-regression showed that published year, number of 
training images, and target disease (ulcers vs erosions, hemorrhage vs 
angioectasia) was found to be the source of heterogeneity. No publication bias 
was detected.
CONCLUSIONS: CAD models showed high performance for the optical diagnosis of 
gastrointestinal ulcer and hemorrhage in wireless capsule endoscopy.

Background Use of artificial intelligence (AI) as a stand-alone reader for 
digital mammography (DM) or digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) breast screening 
could ease radiologists' workload while maintaining quality. Purpose To 
retrospectively evaluate the stand-alone performance of an AI system as an 
independent reader of DM and DBT screening examinations. Materials and Methods 
Consecutive screening-paired and independently read DM and DBT images acquired 
between January 2015 and December 2016 were retrospectively collected from the 
Tomosynthesis Cordoba Screening Trial. An AI system computed a cancer risk score 
(range, 1-100) for DM and DBT examinations independently. AI stand-alone 
performance was measured using the area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUC) and sensitivity and recall rate at different 
operating points selected to have noninferior sensitivity compared with the 
human readings (noninferiority margin, 5%). The recall rate of AI and the human 
readings were compared using a McNemar test. Results A total of 15 999 DM and 
DBT examinations (113 breast cancers, including 98 screen-detected and 15 
interval cancers) from 15 998 women (mean age, 58 years ± 6 [standard 
deviation]) were evaluated. AI achieved an AUC of 0.93 (95% CI: 0.89, 0.96) for 
DM and 0.94 (95% CI: 0.91, 0.97) for DBT. For DM, AI achieved noninferior 
sensitivity as a single (58.4%; 66 of 113; 95% CI: 49.2, 67.1) or double (67.3%; 
76 of 113; 95% CI: 58.2, 75.2) reader, with a reduction in recall rate (P < 
.001) of up to 2% (95% CI: -2.4, -1.6). For DBT, AI achieved noninferior 
sensitivity as a single (77%; 87 of 113; 95% CI: 68.4, 83.8) or double (81.4%; 
92 of 113; 95% CI: 73.3, 87.5) reader, but with a higher recall rate (P < .001) 
of up to 12.3% (95% CI: 11.7, 12.9). Conclusion Artificial intelligence could 
replace radiologists' readings in breast screening, achieving a noninferior 
sensitivity, with a lower recall rate for digital mammography but a higher 
recall rate for digital breast tomosynthesis. Published under a CC BY 4.0

One important aspect of protein function is the binding of proteins to ligands, 
including small molecules, metal ions, and macromolecules such as DNA or RNA. 
Despite decades of experimental progress many binding sites remain obscure. 
Here, we proposed bindEmbed21, a method predicting whether a protein residue 
binds to metal ions, nucleic acids, or small molecules. The Artificial 
Intelligence (AI)-based method exclusively uses embeddings from the 
Transformer-based protein Language Model (pLM) ProtT5 as input. Using only 
single sequences without creating multiple sequence alignments (MSAs), 
bindEmbed21DL outperformed MSA-based predictions. Combination with 
homology-based inference increased performance to F1 = 48 ± 3% (95% CI) and 
MCC = 0.46 ± 0.04 when merging all three ligand classes into one. All results 
were confirmed by three independent data sets. Focusing on very reliably 
predicted residues could complement experimental evidence: For the 25% most 
strongly predicted binding residues, at least 73% were correctly predicted even 
when ignoring the problem of missing experimental annotations. The new method 
bindEmbed21 is fast, simple, and broadly applicable-neither using structure nor 
MSAs. Thereby, it found binding residues in over 42% of all human proteins not 
otherwise implied in binding and predicted about 6% of all residues as binding 
to metal ions, nucleic acids, or small molecules.

There have been few independent evaluations of computer-aided detection (CAD) 
software for tuberculosis (TB) screening, despite the rapidly expanding array of 
available CAD solutions. We developed a test library of chest X-ray (CXR) images 
which was blindly re-read by two TB clinicians with different levels of 
experience and then processed by 12 CAD software solutions. Using Xpert MTB/RIF 
results as the reference standard, we compared the performance characteristics 
of each CAD software against both an Expert and Intermediate Reader, using 
cut-off thresholds which were selected to match the sensitivity of each human 
reader. Six CAD systems performed on par with the Expert Reader (Qure.ai, 
DeepTek, Delft Imaging, JF Healthcare, OXIPIT, and Lunit) and one additional 
software (Infervision) performed on par with the Intermediate Reader only. 
Qure.ai, Delft Imaging and Lunit were the only software to perform significantly 
better than the Intermediate Reader. The majority of these CAD software showed 
significantly lower performance among participants with a past history of TB. 
The radiography equipment used to capture the CXR image was also shown to affect 
performance for some CAD software. TB program implementers now have a wide 
selection of quality CAD software solutions to utilize in their CXR screening 
initiatives.

to investigate their relation to markers of cardiometabolic risk. Non-contrast 
cardiac CT images from the SCAPIS study were used to train and test a 
convolutional neural network based model to quantify EAT by: segmenting the 
pericardium, suppressing noise-induced artifacts in the heart chambers, and, if 
image sets were incomplete, imputing missing EAT volumes. The model achieved a 
mean Dice coefficient of 0.90 when tested against expert manual segmentations on 
25 image sets. Tested on 1400 image sets, the model successfully segmented 99.4% 
of the cases. Automatic imputation of missing EAT volumes had an error of less 
than 3.1% with up to 20% of the slices in image sets missing. The most important 
predictors of EAT volumes were weight and waist, while EAT attenuation was 
predicted mainly by EAT volume. A model with excellent performance, capable of 
fully automatic handling of the most common challenges in large scale EAT 
quantification has been developed. In studies of the importance of EAT in 
disease development, the strong co-variation with anthropometric measures needs 
to be carefully considered.

OBJECTIVE: To compare cognitive testing scores in neurosurgeons and aerospace 
engineers to help settle the age old argument of which phrase-"It's not brain 
surgery" or "It's not rocket science"-is most deserved.
DESIGN: International prospective comparative study.
SETTING: United Kingdom, Europe, the United States, and Canada.
PARTICIPANTS: 748 people (600 aerospace engineers and 148 neurosurgeons). After 
data cleaning, 401 complete datasets were included in the final analysis (329 
aerospace engineers and 72 neurosurgeons).
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Validated online test (Cognitron's Great British 
Intelligence Test) measuring distinct aspects of cognition, spanning planning 
and reasoning, working memory, attention, and emotion processing abilities.
RESULTS: The neurosurgeons showed significantly higher scores than the aerospace 
engineers in semantic problem solving (difference 0.33, 95% confidence interval 
0.13 to 0.52). Aerospace engineers showed significantly higher scores in mental 
manipulation and attention (-0.29, -0.48 to -0.09). No difference was found 
between groups in domain scores for memory (-0.18, -0.40 to 0.03), spatial 
problem solving (-0.19, -0.39 to 0.01), problem solving speed (0.03, -0.20 to 
0.25), and memory recall speed (0.12, -0.10 to 0.35). When each group's scores 
for the six domains were compared with those in the general population, only two 
differences were significant: the neurosurgeons' problem solving speed was 
quicker (mean z score 0.24, 95% confidence interval 0.07 to 0.41) and their 
memory recall speed was slower (-0.19, -0.34 to -0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: In situations that do not require rapid problem solving, it might 
be more correct to use the phrase "It's not brain surgery." It is possible that 
both neurosurgeons and aerospace engineers are unnecessarily placed on a 
pedestal and that "It's a walk in the park" or another phrase unrelated to 
careers might be more appropriate. Other specialties might deserve to be on that 
pedestal, and future work should aim to determine the most deserving profession.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to identify treatable phenotypes, 
optimise ventilation strategies, and provide clinical decision support for 
patients who require mechanical ventilation. Gallifant and colleagues performed 
a systematic review to identify studies using AI to solve a diverse range of 
clinical problems in the ventilated patient. They identify 95 studies, the 
majority of which were reported in the last 5 yr. Their findings indicate that 
the majority of studies have significant methodological bias and are a long way 
from deployment.

BACKGROUND: For the association between time-lapse technology (TLT) and embryo 
ploidy status, there has not yet been fully understood. TLT has the 
characteristics of large amount of data and non-invasiveness. If we want to 
accurately predict embryo ploidy status from TLT, artificial intelligence (AI) 
technology is a good choice. However, the current work of AI in this field needs 
to be strengthened.
METHODS: A total of 469 preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) cycles and 1803 
blastocysts from April 2018 to November 2019 were included in the study. All 
embryo images are captured during 5 or 6 days after fertilization before biopsy 
by time-lapse microscope system. All euploid embryos or aneuploid embryos are 
used as data sets. The data set is divided into training set, validation set and 
test set. The training set is mainly used for model training, the validation set 
is mainly used to adjust the hyperparameters of the model and the preliminary 
evaluation of the model, and the test set is used to evaluate the generalization 
ability of the model. For better verification, we used data other than the 
training data for external verification. A total of 155 PGT cycles from December 
2019 to December 2020 and 523 blastocysts were included in the verification 
process.
RESULTS: The euploid prediction algorithm (EPA) was able to predict euploid on 
the testing dataset with an area under curve (AUC) of 0.80.
CONCLUSIONS: The TLT incubator has gradually become the choice of reproductive 
centers. Our AI model named EPA that can predict embryo ploidy well based on TLT 
data. We hope that this system can serve all in vitro fertilization and embryo 
transfer (IVF-ET) patients in the future, allowing embryologists to have more 
non-invasive aids when selecting the best embryo to transfer.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the existing evidence of a machine learning-based 
classification system that stratifies patients with stroke.
METHODS: The authors carried out a systematic review following the Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 
recommendations for a review article. PubMed, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and 
CINAHL Plus Full Text were searched from January 2015 to February 2021.
RESULTS: There are twelve studies included in this systematic review. Fifteen 
algorithms were used in the included studies. The most common forms of machine 
learning (ML) used to classify stroke patients were the support vector machine 
(SVM) (n = 8 studies), followed by random forest (RF) (n = 7 studies), decision 
tree (DT) (n = 4 studies), gradient boosting (GB) (n = 4 studies), neural 
networks (NNs) (n = 3 studies), deep learning (n = 2 studies), and k-nearest 
neighbor (k-NN) (n = 2 studies), respectively. Forty-four features of inputs 
were used in the included studies, and age and gender are the most common 
features in the ML model.
DISCUSSION: There is no single algorithm that performed better or worse than all 
others at classifying patients with stroke, in part because different input data 
require different algorithms to achieve optimal outcomes.

An increasing number of artificial intelligence (AI) systems are being proposed 
in ophthalmology, motivated by the variety and amount of clinical and imaging 
data, as well as their potential benefits at the different stages of patient 
care. Despite achieving close or even superior performance to that of experts, 
there is a critical gap between development and integration of AI systems in 
ophthalmic practice. This work focuses on the importance of trustworthy AI to 
close that gap. We identify the main aspects or challenges that need to be 
considered along the AI design pipeline so as to generate systems that meet the 
requirements to be deemed trustworthy, including those concerning accuracy, 
resiliency, reliability, safety, and accountability. We elaborate on mechanisms 
and considerations to address those aspects or challenges, and define the roles 
and responsibilities of the different stakeholders involved in AI for ophthalmic 
care, i.e., AI developers, reading centers, healthcare providers, healthcare 
institutions, ophthalmological societies and working groups or committees, 
patients, regulatory bodies, and payers. Generating trustworthy AI is not a 
responsibility of a sole stakeholder. There is an impending necessity for a 
collaborative approach where the different stakeholders are represented along 
the AI design pipeline, from the definition of the intended use to post-market 
surveillance after regulatory approval. This work contributes to establish such 
multi-stakeholder interaction and the main action points to be taken so that the 
potential benefits of AI reach real-world ophthalmic settings.

Upper gastrointestinal (GI) neoplasia account for 35% of GI cancers and 1.5 
million cancer-related deaths every year. Despite its efficacy in preventing 
cancer mortality, diagnostic upper GI endoscopy is affected by a substantial 
miss rate of neoplastic lesions due to failure to recognize a visible lesion or 
imperfect navigation. This may be offset by the real-time application of 
artificial intelligence (AI) for detection (computer-aided detection [CADe]) and 
characterization (computer-aided diagnosis [CADx]) of upper GI neoplasia. 
Stand-alone performance of CADe for esophageal squamous cell neoplasia, 
Barrett's esophagus-related neoplasia, and gastric cancer showed promising 
accuracy, sensitivity ranging between 83% and 93%. However, incorporation of 
CADe/CADx in clinical practice depends on several factors, such as possible bias 
in the training or validation phases of these algorithms, its interaction with 
human endoscopists, and clinical implications of false-positive results. The aim 
of this review is to guide the clinician across the multiple steps of AI 
development in clinical practice.

Community Solutions, Arizona State University, Phoenix, Arizona, USA.

With gun crime on the rise, efforts to curb this form of violence have captured 
the attention of government agencies and police departments alike. One form of 
such efforts is the proliferation of Crime Gun Intelligence Centers (CGICs) in 
police departments across the country. However, with only three 
non-peer-reviewed evaluations of these CGICs to date, our understanding of their 
effectiveness is limited. The present study aims to fill this gap by examining 
the impact of the Phoenix Police Department's (PPD) CGIC on clearance rates and 
prosecutorial outcomes for gun crimes. The data for this study come from PPD's 
Records Management System (RMS), computer-aided dispatch (CAD) system, impounded 
evidence, National Integrated Ballistics Information Network (NIBIN) lead data, 
and arrest data. Prosecutorial data were supplied by the Maricopa County 
Attorney's Office (MCAO). This study examined pretest and posttest differences 
that occurred over the study period. Difference-in-difference (DID) models were 
calculated to assess the impact of the CGIC on the outcome measures of interest. 
We found that from the year prior to the CGIC to 2 years post-CGIC, NIBIN inputs 
increased by 115%, NIBIN leads increased by 163%, timeliness of entry (of 
ballistics evidence) improved with 32% of processed items entered within 24-48 h 
in the second year of the CGIC compared with only 3% the year preceding the 
CGIC, and clearance rates for arrests increased significantly. These findings 
have implications for the continued adoption of CGIC, as well as the utility of 
NIBIN.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a microvascular complication of 
diabetes mellitus and a major cause of vision loss worldwide. The purpose of 
this review is to provide an update on the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy in 
youth, discuss risk factors, and review recent advances in diabetic retinopathy 
screening.
RECENT FINDINGS: While DR has long been considered a microvascular complication, 
recent data suggests that retinal neurodegeneration may precede the vascular 
changes associated with DR. The prevalence of DR has decreased in type 1 
diabetes (T1D) patients following the results of the Diabetes Control and 
Complications Trial and implementation of intensive insulin therapy, with 
prevalence ranging from 14-20% before the year 2000 to 3.7-6% after 2000. In 
contrast, the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy in pediatric type 2 diabetes 
(T2D) is higher, ranging from 9.1-50%. Risk factors for diabetic retinopathy are 
well established and include glycemic control, diabetes duration, hypertension, 
and hyperlipidemia, whereas diabetes technology use including insulin pumps and 
continuous glucose monitors has been shown to have protective effects. Screening 
for DR is recommended for youth with T1D once they are aged ≥ 11 years or 
puberty has started and diabetes duration of 3-5 years. Pediatric T2D patients 
are advised to undergo screening at or soon after diagnosis, and annually 
thereafter, due to the insidious nature of T2D. Recent advances in DR screening 
methods including point of care and artificial intelligence technology have 
increased access to DR screening, while being cost-saving to patients and 
cost-effective to healthcare systems. While the prevalence of diabetic 
retinopathy in youth with T1D has been declining over the last few decades, 
there has been a significant increase in the prevalence of DR in youth with T2D. 
Improving access to diabetic retinopathy screening using novel screening methods 
may help improve detection and early treatment of diabetic retinopathy.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Artificial intelligence (AI) can make advanced inferences 
based on a large amount of data. The mainstream technologies of the AI boom in 
2021 are machine learning (ML) and deep learning, which have made significant 
progress due to the increase in computational resources accompanied by the 
dramatic improvement in computer performance. In this review, we introduce 
AI/ML-based medical devices and prediction models regarding diabetes.
RECENT FINDINGS: In the field of diabetes, several AI-/ML-based medical devices 
and regarding automatic retinal screening, clinical diagnosis support, and 
patient self-management tool have already been approved by the US Food and Drug 
Administration. As for new-onset diabetes prediction using ML methods, its 
performance is not superior to conventional risk stratification models that use 
statistical approaches so far. Despite the current situation, it is expected 
that the predictive performance of AI will soon be maximized by a large amount 
of organized data and abundant computational resources, which will contribute to 
a dramatic improvement in the accuracy of disease prediction models for 
diabetes.

This paper describes an ongoing research project which explores the design and 
use of inexpensive robotics, artificial intelligence techniques, and 
human-computer interaction methods, to enrich assisted living environments. Such 
environments provide help to the inhabitants of a home or office, assisting them 
to perform daily activities, helping them to socialize and interact with others, 
and to provide enhanced levels of security and safeness. We present the 
development of an inexpensive robotic solution to help people with disabilities 
and/or older adults to perform their daily activities. It can be used as a 
remote controlled surveillance system, and also as a personal assistant. It is 
able to recognize each inhabitant, his/her emotions, and detect abnormal 
situations such as falls and health problems. The whole system is designed to 
operate solely within a local network and special attention is given to the 
privacy and data protection of the users.

Australia.

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing social restrictions has been 
profound, affecting the health, livelihoods, and wellbeing of populations 
worldwide. Studies have shown widespread effects on mental health, with an 
increase in stress, loneliness, and depression symptoms related to the pandemic. 
Media plays a critical role in containing and managing crises, by informing 
society and fostering positive behavior change. Social restrictions have led to 
a large increase in reliance on online media channels, and this can influence 
mental health and wellbeing. Anxiety levels, for instance, may be exacerbated by 
exposure to COVID-related content, contagion of negative sentiment among social 
networks, and "fake news." In some cases, this may trigger abstinence, leading 
to isolation and limited access to vital information. To be able to communicate 
distressing news during crises while protecting the wellbeing of individuals is 
not trivial; it requires a deeper understanding of people's emotional response 
to online and social media content. This paper selectively reviews research into 
consequences of social media usage and online news consumption for wellbeing and 
mental health, focusing on and discussing their effects in the context of the 
pandemic. Advances in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, for example, 
Natural Language Processing, Sentiment Analysis, and Emotion Recognition, are 
discussed as useful methods for investigating effects on population mental 
health as the pandemic situation evolves. We present suggestions for future 
research, and for using these advances to assess large data sets of users' 
online content, to potentially inform strategies that enhance the mental health 
of social media users going forward.

The study of sulfur solubility is of great significance to the safe development 
of sulfur-containing gas reservoirs. However, due to measurement difficulties, 
experimental research data on sulfur solubility thus far are limited. Under the 
research background of small samples and poor information, a weighted 
least-squares support vector machine (WLSSVM)-based machine learning model 
suitable for a wide temperature and pressure range is proposed to improve the 
prediction accuracy of sulfur solubility in sour gas. First, we use the 
comprehensive gray relational analysis method to extract important factors 
affecting sulfur solubility as the model input parameters. Then, we use the 
whale optimization algorithm (WOA) and gray wolf optimizer (GWO) intelligence 
algorithms to find the optimal solution of the penalty factor and kernel 
coefficient and bring them into three common kernel functions. The optimal 
kernel function is calculated, and the final WOA-WLSSVM and GWO-WLSSVM models 
are established. Finally, four evaluation indicators and an outlier diagnostic 
method are introduced to test the proposed model's performance. The empirical 
results show that the WOA-WLSSVM model has better performance and reliability; 
the average absolute relative deviation is as low as 3.45%, determination 
coefficient (R 2) is as high as 0.9987, and the prediction accuracy is much 
higher than that of other models.

and Technology, Gaithersburg, Maryland, 20899, United States.

Uncertainty quantification in artificial intelligence (AI)-based predictions of 
material properties is of immense importance for the success and reliability of 
AI applications in materials science. While confidence intervals are commonly 
reported for machine learning (ML) models, prediction intervals, i.e., the 
evaluation of the uncertainty on each prediction, are not as frequently 
available. In this work, we compare three different approaches to obtain such 
individual uncertainty, testing them on 12 ML-physical properties. Specifically, 
we investigated using the quantile loss function, machine learning the 
prediction intervals directly, and using Gaussian processes. We identify each 
approach's advantages and disadvantages and end up slightly favoring the 
modeling of the individual uncertainties directly, as it is the easiest to fit 
and, in most of the cases, minimizes over- and underestimation of the predicted 
errors. All data for training and testing were taken from the publicly available 
JARVIS-DFT database, and the codes developed for computing the prediction 
intervals are available through the JARVIS-tools package.

BACKGROUND: Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inherited error of metabolism, screened 
at 48-72 h of life since 1975 in Hungary. The patients have to keep a strict 
lifelong protein-restricted diet, resulting in PKU and its treatment can lead to 
social and financial burdens. The current study aimed to evaluate the 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of children living with PKU.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A single-centre, cross-sectional, observational study was 
conducted at the Center of Newborn Screening and Inherited Metabolic Disorders 
of Budapest, Hungary, using the PKU-quality of life (PKU-QoL) questionnaire. 
Responses of 59 parents and 11 teenagers were collected. Numerous aspects 
regarding HRQoL were analysed according to clinical compliance and severity. The 
patients were classified into groups with good or suboptimal adherence based on 
regular phenylalanine (Phe) values. The online officially translated versions of 
the adolescent or parental PKU-QoL questionnaire were used and analysed 
anonymously. Differences in HRQoL were compared - PKU vs. Hyperphenylalaninaemia 
(HPA) and good vs. suboptimal adherence.
RESULTS: Twenty-five of 32 examined parameters had no or little impact on HRQoL. 
The most frequently reported symptom was irritability. Food enjoyment was the 
most impacted domain, with a major severity score in the adolescent group 
(median 62,5, IQR: 25-75). The emotional impact was scored at moderate severity 
by both the adolescents and parents. Classical PKU patients with good metabolic 
control were more frequently tired than HPA patients (0,0027). The group with 
poor metabolic adherence showed more frequent tiredness (p = 0,03), slow 
thinking (p = 0,018) and anxiety (p = 0,015).
CONCLUSION: Overall, our patients showed an excellent HRQoL; most domains 
(29/36) were reported as little/no impacted. Worse QoL was found in patients 
with suboptimal metabolic control. Particular attention should be paid to the 
emotional health of PKU patients.

Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inborn error of metabolism caused by variants in the 
phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene and it is characterized by excessively high 
levels of phenylalanine in body fluids. PKU is a paradigm for a genetic disease 
that can be treated and majority of developed countries have a population-based 
newborn screening. Thus, the combination of early diagnosis and immediate 
initiation of treatment has resulted in normal intelligence for treated PKU 
patients. Although PKU is a monogenic disease, decades of research and clinical 
practice have shown that the correlation between the genotype and corresponding 
phenotype is not simple at all. Attempts have been made to discover modifier 
genes for PKU cognitive phenotype but without any success so far. We conducted 
whole genome sequencing of 4 subjects from unrelated non-consanguineous families 
who presented with pathogenic mutations in the PAH gene, high blood 
phenylalanine concentrations and near-normal cognitive development despite no 
treatment. We used cross sample analysis to select genes common for more than 
one patient. Thus, the SHANK gene family emerged as the only relevant gene 
family with variants detected in 3 of 4 analyzed patients. We detected two novel 
variants, p.Pro1591Ala in SHANK1 and p.Asp18Asn in SHANK2, as well as 
SHANK2:p.Gly46Ser, SHANK2:p.Pro1388_Phe1389insLeuPro and SHANK3:p.Pro1716Thr 
variants that were previously described. Computational analysis indicated that 
the identified variants do not abolish the function of SHANK proteins. However, 
changes in posttranslational modifications of SHANK proteins could influence 
functioning of the glutamatergic synapses, cytoskeleton regulation and 
contribute to maintaining optimal synaptic density and number of dendritic 
spines. Our findings are linking SHANK gene family and brain plasticity in PKU 
for the first time. We hypothesize that variant SHANK proteins maintain optimal 
synaptic density and number of dendritic spines under high concentrations of 
phenylalanine and could have protective modifying effect on cognitive 
development of PKU patients.

Application of Deep Learning Technology in Predicting the Risk of Inpatient 
Death in Intensive Care Unit.

Li M(1), Chen H(1), Yan S(1), Xu X(1), Xu H(1).

Author information:
(1)Shanghai Jiangong Hospital Intensive Care Unit (ICU), Shanghai 200083, China.

The Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is an important unit for the rescue of critically 
ill patients in hospitals, and patient mortality is an important indicator to 
measure the level of ICU treatment. Currently, a variety of clinical scoring 
systems are used to evaluate the patient's condition and predict survival, but 
these systems require a lot of resources. However, due to the rapid development 
of artificial intelligence and deep learning, machine learning based methods 
have been used to study the survival prediction of ICU patients. Additionally, 
these methods have made significant progress, but there is still a distance from 
clinical application, and equally metric interpretability of the deep learning 
method is not very mature. Therefore, in this paper, we have proposed a 
predicting model for the life and death of ICU patients, which is primarily 
based on the Fuzzy ARTMAP model. With a thorough analysis of the existing ICU 
patient condition assessment and life and death prediction methods, we have 
observed that patient's ICU monitoring information performs integrated analysis 
and extracts features according to the clinical characteristics of physiological 
indicators. Finally, fuzzy ARTMAP neural network is used to predict the life and 
death of patients. Likewise, prediction results are combined with the clinical 
scoring system and logistic regression, artificial neural network, support 
vector machine, and AdaBoost. Experimental results of these algorithms were 
compared, which verifies that the proposed method has outperformed the existing 
model. The main purpose of the proposed mode is to design a life and death 
prediction method for ICU patients, which has high predictive performance and is 
an acceptable method for clinical medical staff, where ICU monitoring data is 
used. Experimental results show that the method proposed has achieved better 
prediction performance and accuracy ratio, which provide theoretical reference 
for clinical application.

The emergence of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2), which is the etiologic agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19) pandemic, has dominated all aspects of life since of 2020. Research 
studies on the virus and exploration of therapeutic and preventive strategies 
has been moving at rapid rates to control the pandemic. In the field of 
bioinformatics or computational and structural biology, recent research 
strategies have used multiple disciplines to compile large datasets to uncover 
statistical correlations and significance, visualize and model proteins, perform 
molecular dynamics simulations, and employ the help of artificial intelligence 
and machine learning to harness computational processing power to further the 
research on COVID-19, including drug screening, drug design, vaccine 
development, prognosis prediction, and outbreak prediction. These recent 
developments should help us better understand the viral disease and develop the 
much-needed therapies and strategies for the management of COVID-19.

Sub-threshold autistic traits are common in the general population. Children 
with sub-threshold autistic traits have difficulties with social adaptation. 
Contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CNTNAP2) is associated with the development 
of Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and the single-nucleotide polymorphism 
rs2710102 (G/A) of CNTNAP2 is suggested to contribute to sub-threshold social 
impairments and intellectual disabilities. We recruited 67 children with 
Autistic disorder (AD) (49 boys, 18 girls, aged 38-98 months) and 57 typically 
developing (TD) children (34 boys, 23 girls, aged 53-90 months). We assessed the 
participants' intelligence and social reciprocity using the Kaufman Assessment 
Battery for Children (K-ABC) and the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), 
respectively. Genomic DNA was extracted from the buccal mucosa and genotyped for 
rs2710102. A chi-square test revealed a significant association between genotype 
and group [χ2(2) = 6.56, p = 0.038]. When a co-dominant model was assumed, the 
results from linear regression models demonstrated that TD children with 
A-carriers (AA + AG) presented higher SRS T-scores [t(55) = 2.11, p = 0.039] and 
lower simultaneous processing scale scores of K-ABC [t(55) = -2.19, p = 0.032] 
than those with GG homozygotes. These associations were not significant in 
children with ASD. TD children with the rs2710102 A-allele may have more 
sub-threshold autistic traits than those with GG homozygotes, reflected in 
higher SRS scores and lower simultaneous processing scale scores. These results 
support the use of genetic evidence to detect sub-threshold autistic traits.

BACKGROUND: Keratoconus is a disorder characterized by progressive thinning and 
distortion of the cornea. If detected at an early stage, corneal collagen 
cross-linking can prevent disease progression and further visual loss. Although 
advanced forms are easily detected, reliable identification of subclinical 
disease can be problematic. Several different machine learning algorithms have 
been used to improve the detection of subclinical keratoconus based on the 
analysis of multiple types of clinical measures, such as corneal imaging, 
aberrometry, or biomechanical measurements.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to survey and critically evaluate the 
literature on the algorithmic detection of subclinical keratoconus and 
equivalent definitions.
METHODS: For this systematic review, we performed a structured search of the 
following databases: MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science and Cochrane Library 
from January 1, 2010, to October 31, 2020. We included all full-text studies 
that have used algorithms for the detection of subclinical keratoconus and 
excluded studies that did not perform validation. This systematic review 
followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses) recommendations.
RESULTS: We compared the measured parameters and the design of the machine 
learning algorithms reported in 26 papers that met the inclusion criteria. All 
salient information required for detailed comparison, including diagnostic 
criteria, demographic data, sample size, acquisition system, validation details, 
parameter inputs, machine learning algorithm, and key results are reported in 
this study.
CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning has the potential to improve the detection of 
subclinical keratoconus or early keratoconus in routine ophthalmic practice. 
Currently, there is no consensus regarding the corneal parameters that should be 
included for assessment and the optimal design for the machine learning 
algorithm. We have identified avenues for further research to improve early 
detection and stratification of patients for early treatment to prevent disease 
progression.

BACKGROUND: As the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in health care 
increases, it will become increasingly crucial to involve health care 
professionals (HCPs) in developing, validating, and implementing AI-enabled 
technologies. However, because of a lack of AI literacy, most HCPs are not 
adequately prepared for this revolution. This is a significant barrier to 
adopting and implementing AI that will affect patients. In addition, the limited 
existing AI education programs face barriers to development and implementation 
at various levels of medical education.
OBJECTIVE: With a view to informing future AI education programs for HCPs, this 
scoping review aims to provide an overview of the types of current or past AI 
education programs that pertains to the programs' curricular content, modes of 
delivery, critical implementation factors for education delivery, and outcomes 
used to assess the programs' effectiveness.
METHODS: After the creation of a search strategy and keyword searches, a 2-stage 
screening process was conducted by 2 independent reviewers to determine study 
eligibility. When consensus was not reached, the conflict was resolved by 
consulting a third reviewer. This process consisted of a title and abstract scan 
and a full-text review. The articles were included if they discussed an actual 
training program or educational intervention, or a potential training program or 
educational intervention and the desired content to be covered, focused on AI, 
and were designed or intended for HCPs (at any stage of their career).
RESULTS: Of the 10,094 unique citations scanned, 41 (0.41%) studies relevant to 
our eligibility criteria were identified. Among the 41 included studies, 10 
(24%) described 13 unique programs and 31 (76%) discussed recommended curricular 
content. The curricular content of the unique programs ranged from AI use, AI 
interpretation, and cultivating skills to explain results derived from AI 
algorithms. The curricular topics were categorized into three main domains: 
cognitive, psychomotor, and affective.
CONCLUSIONS: This review provides an overview of the current landscape of AI in 
medical education and highlights the skills and competencies required by HCPs to 
effectively use AI in enhancing the quality of care and optimizing patient 
outcomes. Future education efforts should focus on the development of regulatory 
strategies, a multidisciplinary approach to curriculum redesign, a 
competency-based curriculum, and patient-clinician interaction.

Intelligence in Health Care: Choice-Based Conjoint Survey.

BACKGROUND: Certain types of artificial intelligence (AI), that is, deep 
learning models, can outperform health care professionals in particular domains. 
Such models hold considerable promise for improved diagnostics, treatment, and 
prevention, as well as more cost-efficient health care. They are, however, 
opaque in the sense that their exact reasoning cannot be fully explicated. 
Different stakeholders have emphasized the importance of the 
transparency/explainability of AI decision making. Transparency/explainability 
may come at the cost of performance. There is need for a public policy 
regulating the use of AI in health care that balances the societal interests in 
high performance as well as in transparency/explainability. A public policy 
should consider the wider public's interests in such features of AI.
OBJECTIVE: This study elicited the public's preferences for the performance and 
explainability of AI decision making in health care and determined whether these 
preferences depend on respondent characteristics, including trust in health and 
technology and fears and hopes regarding AI.
METHODS: We conducted a choice-based conjoint survey of public preferences for 
attributes of AI decision making in health care in a representative sample of 
the adult Danish population. Initial focus group interviews yielded 6 attributes 
playing a role in the respondents' views on the use of AI decision support in 
health care: (1) type of AI decision, (2) level of explanation, (3) 
performance/accuracy, (4) responsibility for the final decision, (5) possibility 
of discrimination, and (6) severity of the disease to which the AI is applied. 
In total, 100 unique choice sets were developed using fractional factorial 
design. In a 12-task survey, respondents were asked about their preference for 
AI system use in hospitals in relation to 3 different scenarios.
RESULTS: Of the 1678 potential respondents, 1027 (61.2%) participated. The 
respondents consider the physician having the final responsibility for treatment 
decisions the most important attribute, with 46.8% of the total weight of 
attributes, followed by explainability of the decision (27.3%) and whether the 
system has been tested for discrimination (14.8%). Other factors, such as 
gender, age, level of education, whether respondents live rurally or in towns, 
respondents' trust in health and technology, and respondents' fears and hopes 
regarding AI, do not play a significant role in the majority of cases.
CONCLUSIONS: The 3 factors that are most important to the public are, in 
descending order of importance, (1) that physicians are ultimately responsible 
for diagnostics and treatment planning, (2) that the AI decision support is 
explainable, and (3) that the AI system has been tested for discrimination. 
Public policy on AI system use in health care should give priority to such AI 
system use and ensure that patients are provided with information.

BACKGROUND: Critical care research in Canada is conducted primarily in 
academically-affiliated intensive care units with established research 
infrastructure, including research coordinators (RCs). Recently, efforts have 
been made to engage community hospital ICUs in research albeit with barriers. 
Automation or artificial intelligence (AI) could aid the performance of routine 
research tasks. It is unclear which research study processes might be improved 
through AI automation.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of Canadian ICU research 
personnel. The survey contained items characterizing opinions regarding research 
processes that may be amenable to AI automation. We distributed the 
questionnaire via email distribution lists of 3 Canadian research societies. 
Open-ended questions were analyzed using a thematic content analysis approach.
RESULTS: A total of 49 survey responses were received (response rate: 8%). Tasks 
that respondents felt were time-consuming/tedious/tiresome included: screening 
for potentially eligible patients (74%), inputting data into case report forms 
(65%), and preparing internal tracking logs (53%). Tasks that respondents felt 
could be performed by AI automation included: screening for eligible patients 
(59%), inputting data into case report forms (55%), preparing internal tracking 
logs (51%), and randomizing patients into studies (45%). Open-ended questions 
identified enthusiasm for AI automation to improve information accuracy and 
efficiency while freeing up RCs to perform tasks that require human interaction. 
This enthusiasm was tempered by the need for proper AI education and oversight.
CONCLUSIONS: There were balanced supportive (increased efficiency and 
re-allocation of tasks) and challenges (informational accuracy and oversight) 
with regards to AI automation in ICU research.

scRNA-seq is on track for use as a routine measurement of clinical biochemistry 
and to assist in clinical decision-making and guide the performance of molecular 
medicine, but there are still a large number of challenges to be overcome. In 
conclusion, scRNA-seq-based clusters and differentiation of circulating blood 
cells have been examined and informative in patients with various diseases, 
although the information generated from scRNA-seq varies between different 
conditions, technologies, and diseases. Most of the clinical studies published 
have focused on the landscape of circulating immune cells, disease-specific 
patterns of new clusters, understanding of potential mechanisms, and potential 
correlation between cell clusters, differentiations, cell interactions, and 
circulating and migrated cells. It is clear that the information from scRNA-seq 
advances the understanding of the disease, identifies disease-specific target 
panels, and suggests new therapeutic strategies. The adaptation of scRNA-seq as 
a routine clinical measurement will require standardization and normalization of 
scRNA-seq-based comprehensive information and validation in a large population 
of healthy and diseased patients. The integration of public databases on human 
circulating cell clusters and differentiations with an application of artificial 
intelligence and computational science will accelerate the application of 
scRNA-seq for clinical practice. Thus, we call special attention from scientists 
and clinicians to the clinical and translational discovery, validation, and 
medicine opportunities of scRNA-seq development.

The use of deep learning in medical imaging has increased rapidly over the past 
few years, finding applications throughout the entire radiology pipeline, from 
improved scanner performance to automatic disease detection and diagnosis. These 
advancements have resulted in a wide variety of deep learning approaches being 
developed, solving unique challenges for various imaging modalities. This paper 
provides a review on these developments from a technical point of view, 
categorizing the different methodologies and summarizing their implementation. 
We provide an introduction to the design of neural networks and their training 
procedure, after which we take an extended look at their uses in medical 
imaging. We cover the different sections of the radiology pipeline, highlighting 
some influential works and discussing the merits and limitations of deep 
learning approaches compared to other traditional methods. As such, this review 
is intended to provide a broad yet concise overview for the interested reader, 
facilitating adoption and interdisciplinary research of deep learning in the 
field of medical imaging.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop and compare the use of deep neural 
networks (DNN) and support vector machines (SVM) to clinical prognostic scores 
for prognosticating 30-day mortality and 90-day poor functional outcome (PFO) in 
spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage (SICH).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 297 SICH 
patients between December 2014 and May 2016. Clinical data was collected from 
electronic medical records using standardized data collection forms. The machine 
learning workflow included imputation of missing data, dimensionality reduction, 
imbalanced-class correction, and evaluation using cross-validation and 
comparison of accuracy against clinical prognostic scores.
RESULTS: 32 (11%) patients had 30-day mortality while 177 (63%) patients had 
90-day PFO. For prognosticating 30-day mortality, the class-balanced accuracies 
for DNN (0.875; 95% CI 0.800-0.950; McNemar's p-value 1.000) and SVM (0.848; 95% 
CI 0.767-0.930; McNemar's p-value 0.791) were comparable to that of the original 
ICH score (0.833; 95% CI 0.748-0.918). The c-statistics for DNN (0.895; DeLong's 
p-value 0.715), and SVM (0.900; DeLong's p-value 0.619), though greater than 
that of the original ICH score (0.862), were not significantly different. For 
prognosticating 90-day PFO, the class-balanced accuracies for DNN (0.853; 95% CI 
0.772-0.934; McNemar's p-value 0.003) and SVM (0.860; 95% CI 0.781-0.939; 
McNemar's p-value 0.004) were better than that of the ICH-Grading Scale (0.706; 
95% CI 0.600-0.812). The c-statistic for SVM (0.883; DeLong's p-value 0.022) was 
significantly greater than that of the ICH-Grading Scale (0.778), while the 
c-statistic for DNN was 0.864 (DeLong's p-value 0.055).
CONCLUSION: We showed that the SVM model performs significantly better than 
clinical prognostic scores in predicting 90-day PFO in SICH.

Glucocorticoids and inflammatory markers can influence cognitive function. Hair 
cortisol concentrations (HCC) reflect longer-term hypothalamic pituitary adrenal 
(HPA) axis function and combined with immune markers can provide insights into 
how HPA-axis and immune pathways interact to influence cognition. We examined 
the association between HCC and high sensitivity c-reactive protein (hsCRP) 
levels, as well as the interaction between HCC and hsCRP, and cognitive function 
in a sample of 153 females, aged between 18 and 79 years, from a cross-sectional 
case-control study (SHARED ROOTS), conducted in Cape Town, South Africa from May 
2014 until June 2017. We examined whether HCC and hsCRP levels were associated 
with performance on neurocognitive tests in both unadjusted and adjusted linear 
regression models. HCC demonstrated a significant inverse association with 
verbal working memory in both unadjusted (p = 0.010) and adjusted (p = 0.016) 
analyses. There were significant interactions between HCC and hsCRP on verbal 
intelligence (p = 0.016), language (p = 0.023) and executive function 
(p = 0.008) scores, such that at low HCC hsCRP levels were positively associated 
with language (p = 0.020) and executive function (p = 0.006) scores and at high 
HCC hsCRP levels were inversely associated with verbal intelligence (p = 0.034) 
scores. Though the results did not survive correction for multiple comparisons, 
they suggest stress-related neuroendocrine effects on working memory impairment. 
Furthermore, under physiological conditions and low long-term HCC, there may be 
positive effects of peripheral inflammatory markers on cognitive performance, 
whereas there may be detrimental effects when the HPA-axis is dysregulated as 
reflected by high long-term cortisol output.

BACKGROUND: Optimal outcomes after large-vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke are 
highly dependent on prompt diagnosis, effective communication, and treatment, 
making LVO an attractive avenue for the application of artificial intelligence 
(AI), specifically machine learning (ML). Our objective is to conduct a 
systematic review to describe existing AI applications for LVO strokes, 
delineate its effectiveness, and identify areas for future AI applications in 
stroke treatment and prognostication.
METHODS: A systematic review was conducted by searching the PubMed, Embase, and 
Scopus databases. After deduplication, studies were screened by title and 
abstract. Full-text studies were screened for final inclusion based on 
prespecified inclusion and exclusion criteria. Relevant data were extracted from 
each study.
RESULTS: Of 11,512 resultant articles, 40 were included. Of 30 studies with 
reported ML algorithms, the most commonly used ML algorithms were convolutional 
neural networks in 10 (33.3%), support vector machines in 10 (33.0%), and random 
forests in 9 (30.0%). Studies examining triage favored direct transport to a 
stroke center and predicted improved outcomes. ML techniques proved vastly 
accurate in identifying LVO on computed tomography. Applications of AI to 
patient selection for thrombectomy are lacking, although some studies determine 
individual patient eligibility for endovascular treatment with high accuracy. ML 
algorithms have reasonable accuracy in predicting clinical and angiographic 
outcomes and associated factors.
CONCLUSIONS: AI has shown promise in the diagnosis and triage of patients with 
acute stroke. However, the role of AI in the management and prognostication 
remains limited and warrants further research to help in decision support.

We aimed to investigate the change patterns in corneal sub-basal nerve 
morphology and corneal intrinsic aberrations in dry eye disease (DED). Our study 
included 229 eyes of 155 patients with DED and 40 eyes of 20 healthy control. We 
used the Oculus keratograph and the ocular surface disease index questionnaire 
to assess their signs and symptoms. In vivo confocal microscopy was used to 
observe the corneal sub-basal nerves, corneal endothelial cells, and Langerhans 
cells (LCs). An artificial intelligence (AI) technique run by the deep learning 
model generated the sub-basal nerve fibre parameters. Furthermore, we used the 
Pentacam HR system to measure the corneal intrinsic aberrations and corneal 
surface regularity indices. DED patients more frequently had increased anterior 
and total corneal aberrations than controls (P < 0.05). In addition, DED had 
decreased average density and maximum length of corneal nerve. (Both P < 0.01) 
The LC number was significantly correlated with maximum length (CC = -0.19, 
P = 0.01) of the sub-basal nerve fibre. Furthermore, the corneal nerve average 
density was negatively correlated with IHD, and anterior, posterior, and total 
corneal aberrations (All P < 0.05) especially the higher-order aberrations. 
Significant correlations were seen between corneal nerve morphology changes, 
analysed by AI and corneal intrinsic aberrations, particularly higher-order 
aberrations.

BACKGROUND: Developmental language disorder (DLD) often remains undetected until 
children shift from 'learning to read' to 'reading to learn,' around 9 years of 
age. Mono- and bilingual children with DLD frequently have co-occurring reading, 
attention, and related difficulties, compared to children with typical language 
development (TLD). Data for mono- and bilingual children with DLD and TLD would 
aid differentiation of language differences versus disorders in bilingual 
children.
OBJECTIVE: We conducted a scoping review of descriptive research on mono-and 
bilingual children < and >= 9 years old with DLD versus TLD, and related skills 
(auditory processing, attention, cognition, executive function, and reading).
DATA SOURCES: We searched PubMed for the terms "bilingual" and "language 
disorders" or "impairment" and "child[ren]" from August 1, 1979 through October 
1, 2018.
CHARTING METHODS: Two abstracters charted all search results. Main exclusions 
were: secondary data/reviews, special populations, intervention studies, and 
case studies/series. Abstracted data included age, related skills measures', and 
four language groups of participants: monolingual DLD, monolingual TLD, 
bilingual DLD, and bilingual TLD.
RESULTS: Of 366 articles, 159 (43%) met inclusion criteria. Relatively few (14%, 
n = 22) included all 4 language groups, co-occurring difficulties other than 
nonverbal intelligence (n = 49, 31%) or reading (n = 51, 32%) or any 9-18 
year-olds (31%, n = 48). Just 5 (3%) included only 9-18 year-olds. Among studies 
with any 9 to 18 year olds, just 4 (8%, 4/48) included 4 language groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Future research should include mono- and bilingual children with 
both DLD and TLD, beyond 8 years of age, along with data about their related 
skills.

OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this scoping review are to identify the reliability 
and validity of the available tools, their limitations and any recommendations 
to further improve the use of these tools.
STUDY DESIGN: A scoping review methodology was followed to map the literature 
published on the challenges and solutions of conducting evidence synthesis using 
the JBI scoping review methodology.
RESULTS: A total of 47 publications were included in the review. The current 
scoping review identified that LitSuggest, Rayyan, Abstractr, BIBOT, R software, 
RobotAnalyst, DistillerSR, ExaCT and NetMetaXL have potential to be used for the 
automation of systematic reviews. However, they are not without limitations. The 
review also identified other studies that employed algorithms that have not yet 
been developed into user friendly tools. Some of these algorithms showed high 
validity and reliability but their use is conditional on user knowledge of 
computer science and algorithms.
CONCLUSION: Abstract screening has reached maturity; data extraction is still an 
active area. Developing methods to semi-automate different steps of evidence 
synthesis via machine learning remains an important research direction. Also, it 
is important to move from the research prototypes currently available to 
professionally maintained platforms.

ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Tongue coating has been used as an effective 
signature of health in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). The level of greasy 
coating closely relates to the strength of dampness or pathogenic qi in TCM 
theory. Previous empirical studies and our systematic review have shown the 
relation between greasy coating and various diseases, including 
gastroenteropathy, coronary heart disease, and coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19). However, the objective and intelligent greasy coating and related 
diseases recognition methods are still lacking. The construction of the 
artificial intelligent tongue recognition models may provide important syndrome 
diagnosis and efficacy evaluation methods, and contribute to the understanding 
of ethnopharmacological mechanisms based on TCM theory.
AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study aimed to develop an artificial intelligent 
model for greasy tongue coating recognition and explore its application in 
COVID-19.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Herein, we developed greasy tongue coating recognition 
networks (GreasyCoatNet) using convolutional neural network technique and a 
relatively large (N = 1486) set of tongue images from standard devices. Tests 
were performed using both cross-validation procedures and a new dataset (N = 50) 
captured by common cameras. Besides, the accuracy and time efficiency 
comparisons between the GreasyCoatNet and doctors were also conducted. Finally, 
the model was transferred to recognize the greasy coating level of COVID-19.
RESULTS: The overall accuracy in 3-level greasy coating classification with 
cross-validation was 88.8% and accuracy on new dataset was 82.0%, indicating 
that GreasyCoatNet can obtain robust greasy coating estimates from diverse 
datasets. In addition, we conducted user study to confirm that our GreasyCoatNet 
outperforms TCM practitioners, yet only consuming roughly 1% of doctors' 
examination time. Critically, we demonstrated that GreasyCoatNet, along with 
transfer learning, can construct more proper classifier of COVID-19, compared to 
directly training classifier on patient versus control datasets. We, therefore, 
derived a disease-specific deep learning network by finetuning the generic 
GreasyCoatNet.
CONCLUSIONS: Our framework may provide an important research paradigm for 
differentiating tongue characteristics, diagnosing TCM syndrome, tracking 
disease progression, and evaluating intervention efficacy, exhibiting its unique 
potential in clinical applications.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Endoscopy is a pivotal method for detecting early gastric 
cancer (EGC). However, skill among endoscopists varies greatly. Here, we 
proposed a deep learning-based system named ENDOANGEL-ME to diagnose EGC in 
magnifying image-enhanced endoscopy (M-IEE).
METHODS: M-IEE images were retrospectively obtained from 6 hospitals in China, 
including 4667 images for training and validation, 1324 images for internal 
tests, and 4702 images for external tests. One hundred eighty-seven stored 
videos from 2 hospitals were used to evaluate the performance of ENDOANGEL-ME 
and endoscopists and to assess the effect of ENDOANGEL-ME on improving the 
performance of endoscopists. Prospective consecutive patients undergoing M-IEE 
were enrolled from August 17, 2020 to August 2, 2021 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan 
University to assess the applicability of ENDOANGEL-ME in clinical practice.
RESULTS: A total of 3099 patients undergoing M-IEE were enrolled in this study. 
The diagnostic accuracy of ENDOANGEL-ME for diagnosing EGC was 88.44% and 90.49% 
in internal and external images, respectively. In 93 internal videos, 
ENDOANGEL-ME achieved an accuracy of 90.32% for diagnosing EGC, significantly 
superior to that of senior endoscopists (70.16% ± 8.78%). In 94 external videos, 
with the assistance of ENDOANGEL-ME, endoscopists showed improved accuracy and 
sensitivity (85.64% vs 80.32% and 82.03% vs 67.19%, respectively). In 194 
prospective consecutive patients with 251 lesions, ENDOANGEL-ME achieved a 
sensitivity of 92.59% (25/27) and an accuracy of 83.67% (210/251) in real 
clinical practice.
CONCLUSIONS: This multicenter diagnostic study showed that ENDOANGEL-ME can be 
well applied in the clinical setting. (Clinical trial registration number: 
ChiCTR2000035116.).

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A reliable assessment of bowel preparation is important to 
ensure high-quality colonoscopy. Current bowel preparation scoring systems are 
limited by interobserver variability. This study aimed to demonstrate objective 
assessment of bowel preparation adequacy using an artificial intelligence 
(AI)/convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm developed from colonoscopy 
videos.
METHODS: Two CNNs were developed using a training set of 73,304 images from 200 
colonoscopies. First, a binary CNN was developed and trained to distinguish 
video frames that were appropriate versus inappropriate for scoring with the 
Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS). A second multiclass CNN was developed and 
trained on 26,950 appropriate frames that were expertly annotated with BBPS 
segment scores (0-3). We validated the algorithm using 252 10-second video clips 
that were assigned BBPS segment scores by 2 experts. The algorithm provided mean 
BBPS scores based on the algorithm (AI-BBPS) by calculating mean BBPS based on 
each frame's scoring. We maximized the algorithm's performance by choosing a 
dichotomized AI-BBPS score that closely matched dichotomized BBPS scores (ie, 
adequate vs inadequate). We tested the mean BBPS score based on the algorithm 
AI-BBPS against human rating using 30 independent 10-second video clips (test 
set 1) and 10 full withdrawal colonoscopy videos (test set 2).
RESULTS: In the validation set, the algorithm demonstrated an area under the 
curve of .918 and accuracy of 85.3% for detection of inadequate bowel 
cleanliness. In test set 1, sensitivity for inadequate bowel preparation was 
100% and agreement between raters and AI was 76.7% to 83.3%. In test set 2, 
sensitivity for inadequate bowel preparation for each segment was 100% and 
agreement between raters and AI was 68.9% to 89.7%. Agreement between raters 
alone versus raters and AI were similar (κ = .694 and .649, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: The algorithm assessment of bowel cleanliness as measured with the 
BBPS showed good performance and agreement with experts including full 
withdrawal colonoscopies.

The development of artificial intelligence (AI) began in the mid-20th century 
but has been rapidly accelerating in the past decade. Reflecting the development 
of digital health over the past few years, this trend is also seen in medicine. 
The field of cardiovascular medicine uses a wide variety and a large amount of 
biosignals, so there are many situations where AI can contribute. The 
development of AI is in progress for all aspects of the healthcare system, 
including the prevention, screening, and treatment of diseases and the 
prediction of the prognosis. AI is expected to be used to provide 
specialist-level medical care, even in a situation where medical resources are 
scarce. However, like other medical devices, the concept and mechanism of AI 
must be fully understood when used; otherwise, it may be used inappropriately, 
resulting in detriment to the patient. Therefore, it is important to understand 
what we need to know as a cardiologist handling AI. This review introduces the 
basics and principles of AI, then shows how far the current development of AI 
has come, and finally gives a brief introduction of how to start the AI 
development for those who want to develop their own AI.

RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To explore the value of an artificial intelligence 
(AI)-based application for identifying plaque-specific stenosis and obstructive 
coronary artery disease from monoenergetic spectral reconstructions on coronary 
computed tomography angiography (CTA).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled 71 consecutive patients 
(52 men, 19 women; 63.3 ± 10.7 years) who underwent coronary CTA and invasive 
coronary angiography for diagnosing coronary artery disease. The conventional 
120 kVp images and eight different virtual monoenergetic images (VMIs) (from 40 
keV to 140 keV at increment of 10 keV) were reconstructed. An AI system 
automatically detected plaques from the conventional 120 kVp images and VMIs and 
calculated the degree of stenosis, which was further compared to invasive 
coronary angiography. The assessment was performed at a segment, vessel, and 
patient level.
RESULTS: Vessel and segment-based analyses showed comparable diagnostic 
performance between conventional CTA images and VMIs from 50 keV to 90 keV. For 
vessel-based analysis, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, 
negative predictive value and diagnostic accuracy of conventional CTA were 74.3% 
(95% CI: 64.9%-82.0%), 85.6% (95% CI: 77.0%-91.4%), 84.3% (95% CI: 75.2%-90.7%), 
76.1% (95% CI: 67.1%-83.3%) and 79.8% (95% CI: 73.7%-84.9%), respectively; the 
average sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive 
value and diagnostic accuracy values of the VMIs ranging from 50 keV to 90 keV 
were 71.6%, 90.7%, 87.5%, 64.1% and 81.6%, respectively. For plaque-based 
assessment, diagnostic performance of the average VMIs ranging from 50 keV to 
100 keV showed no significant statistical difference in diagnostic accuracy 
compared to those of conventional CTA images in detecting calcified (91.4% vs. 
93.8%, p > 0.05), noncalcified (92.6% vs. 85.2%, p > 0.05) or mixed (80.2% vs. 
81.2%, p > 0.05) stenosis, although the specificity was slightly higher (53.4% 
vs. 40.0%, p > 0.05) in detecting stenosis caused by mixed plaques. For VMIs 
above 100 keV, the diagnostic accuracy dropped significantly.
CONCLUSION: Our study showed that the performance of an AI-based application 
employed to detect significant coronary stenosis in virtual monoenergetic 
reconstructions ranging from 50 keV to 90 keV was comparable to conventional 120 
kVp reconstructions.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Supporting clinician mental health and well-being must 
start in the learning environment, especially as health profession students have 
been shown to have higher rates of mental illness than their peers pursuing 
other careers. This project aimed to support positive mental health in pharmacy 
students through small changes that faculty implemented both inside and outside 
of the classroom.
EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITY AND SETTING: In partnership with the Counseling and Mental 
Health Center, faculty received training, resources, and (in some cases) 
classroom observation and feedback on how to incorporate small changes that 
support student well-being. Assessments were performed each semester beginning 
in spring 2018 and ending in spring 2020. These included the Mental Health 
Continuum - Short Form (measuring positive mental health and well-being), the 
Theories of Intelligence Scale - Self Form for Adults (measuring growth 
mindset), the Sense of Belonging Scale (measuring five domains of social 
connectedness), and the Brief Resilience Scale (measuring resilience). 
Participating faculty were surveyed regarding how frequently selected activities 
were incorporated into their practice and how comfortable they felt supporting 
student mental health.
FINDINGS: Positive trends were seen throughout the project on the scales 
assessing growth mindset and sense of belonging.
SUMMARY: Supporting positive mental health in pharmacy students in the learning 
environment is important for both students and the quality and safety of the 
health care system. Future efforts should expand on this work by refining the 
measurements used, identifying more interventions, and evaluating the impact 
these efforts have as students become pharmacists.

BACKGROUND: HIV incidence is increasing in eastern Europe and central Asia, 
primarily driven by injecting drug use. Coverage of antiretroviral therapy (ART) 
and opioid agonist therapy are suboptimal, with many people who inject drugs 
(PWID) being incarcerated. We aimed to assess whether use of monies saved as a 
result of decriminalisation of drug use or possession to scale up ART and opioid 
agonist therapy could control HIV transmission among PWID in eastern Europe and 
central Asia.
METHODS: A dynamic HIV transmission model among PWID incorporating 
incarceration, ART, and opioid agonist therapy was calibrated to Belarus, 
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and St Petersburg (Russia). Country-specific costs for 
opioid agonist therapy, ART, and incarceration were collated or estimated. 
Compared with baseline, the model prospectively projected the life-years gained, 
incremental costs (2018 euros), and infections prevented over 2020-40 for three 
scenarios. The decriminalisation scenario removed incarceration resulting from 
drug use or possession for personal use, reducing incarceration among PWID by 
24·8% in Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan and 46·4% in St Petersburg; the 
public health approach scenario used savings from decriminalisation to scale up 
ART and opioid agonist therapy; and the full scale-up scenario included the 
decriminalisation scenario plus investment of additional resources to scale up 
ART to the UNAIDS 90-90-90 target of 81% coverage and opioid agonist therapy to 
the WHO target of 40% coverage. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios per 
life-year gained for each scenario were calculated and compared with 
country-specific gross domestic product per-capita willingness-to-pay 
thresholds. Costs and life-years gained were discounted 3% annually.
FINDINGS: Current levels of incarceration, opioid agonist therapy, and ART were 
estimated to cost from €198 million (95% credibility interval 173-224) in 
Kyrgyzstan to €4129 million (3897-4358) in Kazakhstan over 2020-40; 74·8-95·8% 
of these total costs were incarceration costs. Decriminalisation resulted in 
cost savings (€38-773 million due to reduced prison costs; 16·9-26·1% reduction 
in overall costs) but modest life-years gained (745-1694). The public health 
approach was cost saving, allowing each setting to reach 81% ART coverage and 
29·7-41·8% coverage of opioid agonist therapy, resulting in 17 768-148 464 
life-years gained and 58·9-83·7% of infections prevented. Results were similar 
for the full scale-up scenario.
INTERPRETATION: Cost savings from decriminalisation of drug use could greatly 
reduce HIV transmission through increased coverage of opioid agonist therapy and 
ART among PWID in eastern Europe and central Asia.

BACKGROUND: This systematic review aimed to evaluate AI chatbot characteristics, 
functions, and core conversational capacities and investigate whether AI chatbot 
interventions were effective in changing physical activity, healthy eating, 
weight management behaviors, and other related health outcomes.
METHODS: In collaboration with a medical librarian, six electronic bibliographic 
databases (PubMed, EMBASE, ACM Digital Library, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and 
IEEE) were searched to identify relevant studies. Only randomized controlled 
trials or quasi-experimental studies were included. Studies were screened by two 
independent reviewers, and any discrepancy was resolved by a third reviewer. The 
National Institutes of Health quality assessment tools were used to assess risk 
of bias in individual studies. We applied the AI Chatbot Behavior Change Model 
to characterize components of chatbot interventions, including chatbot 
characteristics, persuasive and relational capacity, and evaluation of outcomes.
RESULTS: The database search retrieved 1692 citations, and 9 studies met the 
inclusion criteria. Of the 9 studies, 4 were randomized controlled trials and 5 
were quasi-experimental studies. Five out of the seven studies suggest chatbot 
interventions are promising strategies in increasing physical activity. In 
contrast, the number of studies focusing on changing diet and weight status was 
limited. Outcome assessments, however, were reported inconsistently across the 
studies. Eighty-nine and thirty-three percent of the studies specified a name 
and gender (i.e., woman) of the chatbot, respectively. Over half (56%) of the 
studies used a constrained chatbot (i.e., rule-based), while the remaining 
studies used unconstrained chatbots that resemble human-to-human communication.
CONCLUSION: Chatbots may improve physical activity, but we were not able to make 
definitive conclusions regarding the efficacy of chatbot interventions on 
physical activity, diet, and weight management/loss. Application of AI chatbots 
is an emerging field of research in lifestyle modification programs and is 
expected to grow exponentially. Thus, standardization of designing and reporting 
chatbot interventions is warranted in the near future.

BACKGROUND: There is no satisfactory indicator for monitoring recurrence after 
resection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This retrospective study aimed to 
design and validate an HCC monitor recurrence (HMR) model for patients without 
metastasis after hepatectomy.
METHODS: A training cohort was recruited from 1179 patients with HCC without 
metastasis after hepatectomy between February 2012 and December 2015. An HMR 
model was developed using an AdaBoost classifier algorithm. The factors included 
patient age, TNM staging, tumor size, and pre/postoperative dynamic variations 
of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). The diagnostic efficacy of the model was evaluated 
based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs). The 
model was validated using a cohort of 695 patients.
RESULTS: In preoperative patients with positive or negative AFP, the AUC of the 
validation cohort in the HMR model was .8877, which indicated better diagnostic 
efficacy than that of serum AFP (AUC, .7348). The HMR model predicted recurrence 
earlier than computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging did by 191.58 ± 165 
days. In addition, the HMR model can predict the prognosis of patients with HCC 
after resection.
CONCLUSIONS: The HMR model established in this study is more accurate than serum 
AFP for monitoring recurrence after hepatectomy for HCC and can be used for 
real-time monitoring of the postoperative status in patients with HCC without 
metastasis.

The origins of human cumulative culture: from the foraging niche to collective 
intelligence.

Migliano AB(1), Vinicius L(1).

Various studies have investigated cognitive mechanisms underlying culture in 
humans and other great apes. However, the adaptive reasons for the evolution of 
uniquely sophisticated cumulative culture in our species remain unclear. We 
propose that the cultural capabilities of humans are the evolutionary result of 
a stepwise transition from the ape-like lifestyle of earlier hominins to the 
foraging niche still observed in extant hunter-gatherers. Recent ethnographic, 
archaeological and genetic studies have provided compelling evidence that the 
components of the foraging niche (social egalitarianism, sexual and social 
division of labour, extensive co-residence and cooperation with unrelated 
individuals, multilocality, fluid sociality and high between-camp mobility) 
engendered a unique multilevel social structure where the cognitive mechanisms 
underlying cultural evolution (high-fidelity transmission, innovation, teaching, 
recombination, ratcheting) evolved as adaptations. Therefore, multilevel 
sociality underlies a 'social ratchet' or irreversible task specialization 
splitting the burden of cultural knowledge across individuals, which may explain 
why human collective intelligence is uniquely able to produce sophisticated 
cumulative culture. The foraging niche perspective may explain why a complex 
gene-culture dual inheritance system evolved uniquely in humans and interprets 
the cultural, morphological and genetic origins of Homo sapiens as a process of 
recombination of innovations appearing in differentiated but interconnected 
populations. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'The emergence 
of collective knowledge and cumulative culture in animals, humans and machines'.

Human societies are collective brains. People within every society have cultural 
brains-brains that have evolved to selectively seek out adaptive knowledge and 
socially transmit solutions. Innovations emerge at a population level through 
the transmission of serendipitous mistakes, incremental improvements and novel 
recombinations. The rate of innovation through these mechanisms is a function of 
(1) a society's size and interconnectedness (sociality), which affects the 
number of models available for learning; (2) fidelity of information 
transmission, which affects how much information is lost during social learning; 
and (3) cultural trait diversity, which affects the range of possible solutions 
available for recombination. In general, and perhaps surprisingly, all three 
levers can increase and harm innovation by creating challenges around 
coordination, conformity and communication. Here, we focus on the 'paradox of 
diversity'-that cultural trait diversity offers the largest potential for 
empowering innovation, but also poses difficult challenges at both an 
organizational and societal level. We introduce 'cultural evolvability' as a 
framework for tackling these challenges, with implications for entrepreneurship, 
polarization and a nuanced understanding of the effects of diversity. This 
framework can guide researchers and practitioners in how to reap the benefits of 
diversity by reducing costs. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 
'The emergence of collective knowledge and cumulative culture in animals, humans 
and machines'.

Ethics as attention to context: recommendations for the ethics of artificial 
intelligence.

This article shows that current ethics guidance documents and initiatives for 
artificial intelligence (AI) tend to be dominated by a principled approach to 
ethics. Although this brings value to the field, it also entails some risks, 
especially in relation to the abstraction of this form of ethics that makes it 
poorly equipped to engage with and address deep socio-political issues and the 
material impacts of AI. This is particularly problematic considering the risk 
for AI to further entrench already existing social inequalities and injustices 
and contribute to environmental damage. To respond to this challenge posed by AI 
ethics today, this article proposes to complement the existing principled 
approach with an approach to ethics as attention to context and relations. It 
does so by drawing from alternative ethical theories to the dominant principled 
one, especially the ethics of care or other feminist approaches to ethics. 
Related to this, it encourages the inclusion of social sciences and humanities 
in the development, deployment and use of AI, as well as in AI ethics 
discussions and initiatives. This article presents this proposal for an ethics 
as attention to context and formulates a series of practical recommendations to 
implement this proposal concretely.

Artificial intelligence (AI) as an emerging technology is gaining momentum in 
medical imaging. Recently, deep learning-based AI techniques have been actively 
investigated in medical imaging, and its potential applications range from data 
acquisition and image reconstruction to image analysis and understanding. In 
this review, we focus on the use of deep learning in image reconstruction for 
advanced medical imaging modalities including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 
computed tomography (CT), and positron emission tomography (PET). Particularly, 
recent deep learning-based methods for image reconstruction will be emphasized, 
in accordance with their methodology designs and performances in handling 
volumetric imaging data. It is expected that this review can help relevant 
researchers understand how to adapt AI for medical imaging and which advantages 
can be achieved with the assistance of AI.

Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) is used to study inherent uncertainties using the 
Basic DRASTIC Framework (BDF) for assessing the groundwater vulnerability in a 
study area related to Lake Urmia. BMA is naturally an Inclusive Multiple 
Modelling (IMM) strategy at two levels; at Level 1 multiple models are 
constructed and the paper constructs three AI (Artificial Intelligence) models, 
which comprise ANN (Artificial Neural Network), GEP (Gene Expression 
Programming), and SVM (Support Vector Machines) but their outputs are fed to the 
next level model; at Level 2, BMA combines ANN, GEP and SVM (the Level 1 models) 
to quantify their inherent uncertainty in terms of within and in-between model 
errors. The model performance is tested by using the nitrate-N concentrations 
measured for the aquifer. The results show that in this particular study area, 
Level 1 models, even BDF, are quite accurate, but the above modelling strategy 
maximises the extracted information from the local data and BMA reveals that the 
higher uncertainties occur at areas with higher vulnerability; whereas lower 
uncertainties are observed at areas with lower vulnerabilities.

BACKGROUND: Neuropsychological assessment is considered a valid tool in the 
diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders. However, there is an important overlap 
in cognitive profiles between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and behavioural variant 
frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), and the usefulness in diagnosis is uncertain. 
We aimed to develop machine learning-based models for the diagnosis using 
cognitive tests.
METHODS: Three hundred and twenty-nine participants (170 AD, 72 bvFTD, 87 
healthy control [HC]) were enrolled. Evolutionary algorithms, inspired by the 
process of natural selection, were applied for both mono-objective and 
multi-objective classification and feature selection. Classical algorithms 
(NativeBayes, Support Vector Machines, among others) were also used, and a 
meta-model strategy.
RESULTS: Accuracies for the diagnosis of AD, bvFTD and the differential 
diagnosis between them were higher than 84%. Algorithms were able to 
significantly reduce the number of tests and scores needed. Free and Cued 
Selective Reminding Test, verbal fluency and Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination 
were amongst the most meaningful tests.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study found high levels of accuracy for diagnosis using 
exclusively neuropsychological tests, which supports the usefulness of cognitive 
assessment in diagnosis. Machine learning may have a role in improving the 
interpretation and test selection.

PURPOSE: This single-center study aimed to develop a convolutional neural 
network to segment multiple consecutive axial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
slices of the lumbar spinal muscles of patients with lower back pain and 
automatically classify fatty muscle degeneration.
METHODS: We developed a fully connected deep convolutional neural network (CNN) 
with a pre-trained U-Net model trained on a dataset of 3,650 axial T2-weighted 
MRI images from 100 patients with lower back pain. We included all qualities of 
MRI; the exclusion criteria were fractures, tumors, infection, or spine 
implants. The training was performed using k-fold cross-validation (k = 10), and 
performance was evaluated using the dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and 
cross-sectional area error (CSA error). For clinical correlation, we used a 
simplified Goutallier classification (SGC) system with three classes.
RESULTS: The mean DSC was high for overall muscle (0.91) and muscle tissue 
segmentation (0.83) but showed deficiencies in fatty tissue segmentation (0.51). 
The CSA error was small for the overall muscle area of 8.42%, and fatty tissue 
segmentation showed a high mean CSA error of 40.74%. The SGC classification was 
correctly predicted in 75% of the patients.
CONCLUSION: Our fully connected CNN segmented overall muscle and muscle tissue 
with high precision and recall, as well as good DSC values. The mean predicted 
SGC values of all available patient axial slices showed promising results. With 
an overall Error of 25%, further development is needed for clinical 
implementation. Larger datasets and training of other model architectures are 
required to segment fatty tissue more accurately.

Will Artificial Intelligence (AI) re-humanize or de-humanize medicine? As AI 
becomes pervasive in clinical medicine, we argue that the ethical framework that 
sustains a responsible implementation of such technologies should be 
reconsidered. The emergence of AI in the clinical setting will challenge our 
traditional moral boundaries surrounding discussions of patient care since it is 
unclear how the implementation of AI will promote and enhance the humanistic 
dimensions of medical practice. There are reasons for concern regarding 1) the 
anthropological implications of AI in the clinical context; 2) the method(s) and 
framework(s) used to address ethical issues in medicine; and 3) the impact of AI 
on clinical practice, particularly in the nature of clinical judgment. These 
three concerns are examined in hopes of providing pointers for subsequent and 
more in-depth discussions regarding clinical practice but the training of future 
health professionals.

Our aim was to assess the tomographic presence of diabetic macular edema in type 
2 diabetes patients screened for diabetic retinopathy with color fundus 
photographs and an artificial intelligence algorithm. Color fundus photographs 
obtained with a low-cost smartphone-based handheld retinal camera were analyzed 
by the algorithm; patients with suspected macular lesions underwent ocular 
coherence tomography. A total of 366 patients were screened; diabetic macular 
edema was suspected in 34 and confirmed in 29 individuals, with average age 
60.5 ± 10.9 years and glycated hemoglobin 9.8 ± 2.4%; use of insulin, statins, 
and aspirin were reported in 44.8%, 37.9%, and 34.5% of individuals, 
respectively; systemic blood hypertension, dyslipidemia, abdominal obesity, 
chronic kidney disease, and risk for diabetic foot ulcers were present in 100%, 
58.6%, 62.1%, 48.3%, and 27.5% of individuals, respectively. Proliferative 
diabetic retinopathy was present in 31% of patients with macular edema; severity 
level was associated with albuminuria (p = 0.028). Eyes with macular edema had 
average central macular thickness 329.89 ± 80.98 m[Formula: see text]; 
intraretinal cysts, sub retinal fluid, hyper-reflective foci, epiretinal 
membrane, and vitreomacular traction were found in 87.2%, 6.4%, 85.1%, 10.6%, 
and 6.4% of eyes, respectively. Diabetic retinopathy screening overwhelms health 
systems and is typically based on color fundus photographs, with high 
false-positive rates for the detection of diabetic macular edema. The present, 
semi-automated strategy comprising artificial intelligence algorithms integrated 
with smartphone-based retinal cameras could improve screening in low-resource 
settings with limited availability of ocular coherence tomography, allowing 
increased access rates and ultimately contributing to tackle preventable 
blindness.

Artificial intelligence (AI) systems have increasingly achieved expert-level 
performance in medical imaging applications. However, there is growing concern 
that such AI systems may reflect and amplify human bias, and reduce the quality 
of their performance in historically under-served populations such as female 
patients, Black patients, or patients of low socioeconomic status. Such biases 
are especially troubling in the context of underdiagnosis, whereby the AI 
algorithm would inaccurately label an individual with a disease as healthy, 
potentially delaying access to care. Here, we examine algorithmic underdiagnosis 
in chest X-ray pathology classification across three large chest X-ray datasets, 
as well as one multi-source dataset. We find that classifiers produced using 
state-of-the-art computer vision techniques consistently and selectively 
underdiagnosed under-served patient populations and that the underdiagnosis rate 
was higher for intersectional under-served subpopulations, for example, Hispanic 
female patients. Deployment of AI systems using medical imaging for disease 
diagnosis with such biases risks exacerbation of existing care biases and can 
potentially lead to unequal access to medical treatment, thereby raising ethical 
concerns for the use of these models in the clinic.

Objective. To determine the impact of telehealth-based simulations on students' 
social and emotional development.Methods. First-year pharmacy students enrolled 
in a professional skills course were eligible to participate in the study. 
Before and after the course, students completed the Personal-Interpersonal 
Competence Assessment, which codes onto eight subcategories: situation 
monitoring, inspire others, intimacy, awareness of one's aptitude, initiative to 
pursue leadership, empathy, sociability, and awareness of one's emotions. 
Students participated in seven telehealth-based simulations. Prior to each 
simulation, students watched a role modeling video highlighting social and 
emotional competence techniques used by a pharmacist during a consultation. 
Students then participated in simulated consultations that occurred in Zoom 
breakout rooms. Each student completed one consult while a teaching assistant 
completed a rubric derived from the Personal-Interpersonal Competence 
Assessment. Teaching assistants then provided formative feedback related to the 
student's social and emotional competence. At the semester midpoint, students 
completed a video log reflecting on their social and emotional development. 
Statistical analyses compared different time points of students' scores on the 
Personal-Interpersonal Competence Assessment and scores given by teaching 
assistants, while qualitative analysis was used for the video logs.Results. At 
the end of the course, improvement was noted on all factors of the 
Personal-Interpersonal Competence Assessment. Scores given by teaching 
assistants showed significant improvement over the semester, with the highest 
improvement noted on the subcategories inspiration and situation monitoring. On 
the video log, 80% of students noted improvements in their consideration of 
others.Conclusion. These findings suggest value in using role modeling, 
telehealth-based simulations, and teaching assistant feedback on pharmacy 
students' social and emotional development.

Bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) are highly evolved and sophisticated systems 
that produce bioenergy via exoelectrogenic microbes. Artificial intelligence 
(AI) helps to understand, relate, model, and predict both process parameters and 
microbial diversity, resulting in higher performance. This approach has 
revolutionized BESs through highly advanced computational algorithms that best 
suit the systems' architecture.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a useful aid in numerous clinical 
applications for diagnosis and treatment decisions. Deep neural networks have 
shown the same or better performance than clinicians in many tasks owing to the 
rapid increase in the available data and computational power. In order to 
conform to the principles of trustworthy AI, it is essential that the AI system 
be transparent, robust, fair, and ensure accountability. Current deep neural 
solutions are referred to as black-boxes due to a lack of understanding of the 
specifics concerning the decision-making process. Therefore, there is a need to 
ensure the interpretability of deep neural networks before they can be 
incorporated into the routine clinical workflow. In this narrative review, we 
utilized systematic keyword searches and domain expertise to identify nine 
different types of interpretability methods that have been used for 
understanding deep learning models for medical image analysis applications based 
on the type of generated explanations and technical similarities. Furthermore, 
we report the progress made towards evaluating the explanations produced by 
various interpretability methods. Finally, we discuss limitations, provide 
guidelines for using interpretability methods and future directions concerning 
the interpretability of deep neural networks for medical imaging analysis.

PURPOSE: Changes in cerebral cortical regions occur in HIV-infected patients, 
even in those with mild neurocognitive disorders. Working memory / attention is 
one of the most affected cognitive domain in these patients, worsening their 
quality of life. Our objective was to assess whether cortical thickness differs 
between HIV-infected patients with and without working memory deficit.
METHODS: Forty-one adult HIV-infected patients with and without working memory 
deficit were imaged on a 1.5 T scanner. Working memory deficit was classified by 
composite Z scores for performance on the Digits and Letter-Number Sequencing 
subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (third edition; WAIS-III). 
Cortical thickness was determined using FreeSurfer software. Differences in mean 
cortical thickness between groups, corrected for multiple comparisons using 
Monte-Carlo simulation, were examined using the query design estimate contrast 
tool of the FreeSurfer software.
RESULTS: Greater cortical thickness in left pars opercularis of the inferior 
frontal gyrus, and rostral and caudal portions of the left middle frontal gyrus 
(cluster 1; p = .004), and left superior frontal gyrus (cluster 2; p = .004) was 
observed in HIV-infected patients with working memory deficit compared with 
those without such deficit. Negative correlations were found between 
WAIS-III-based Z scores and cortical thickness in the two clusters (cluster 1: ρ 
= -0.59; cluster 2: ρ = -0.47).
CONCLUSION: HIV-infected patients with working memory deficit have regions of 
greater thickness in the left frontal cortices compared with those without such 
deficit, which may reflect increased synaptic contacts and/or an inflammatory 
response related to the damage caused by HIV infection.

Research using artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine is expected to 
significantly influence the practice of medicine and the delivery of health care 
in the near future. However, for successful deployment, the results must be 
transported across health care facilities. We present a cross-facilities 
application of an AI model that predicts the need for an emergency caesarean 
during birth. The transported model showed benefit; however, there can be 
challenges associated with interfacility variation in reporting practices.

INTRODUCTION: Although the management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has improved 
in major way over the last decades, this disease still leads to an important 
burden for patients and society, and there is a need to develop more 
personalized approaches. Machine learning (ML) methods are more and more used in 
health-related studies and can be applied to different sorts of data (clinical, 
radiological, or 'omics' data). Such approaches may improve the management of 
patients with RA.
AREAS COVERED: In this paper, we propose a review regarding ML approaches 
applied to RA. A scoping literature search was performed in PubMed, in September 
2021 using the following MeSH terms: 'arthritis, rheumatoid' and 'machine 
learning'. Based on this search, the usefulness of ML methods for RA diagnosis, 
monitoring, and prediction of response to treatment and RA outcomes, is 
discussed.
EXPERT OPINION: ML methods have the potential to revolutionize RA-related 
research and improve disease management and patient care. Nevertheless, these 
models are not yet ready to contribute fully to rheumatologists' daily practice. 
Indeed, these methods raise technical, methodological, and ethical issues, which 
should be addressed properly to allow their implementation. Collaboration 
between data scientists, clinical researchers, and physicians is therefore 
required to move this field forward.

In living organisms, sensory and motor processes are distributed, locally 
merged, and capable of forming dynamic sensorimotor associations. We introduce a 
simple and efficient organic neuromorphic circuit for local sensorimotor merging 
and processing on a robot that is placed in a maze. While the robot is exposed 
to external environmental stimuli, visuomotor associations are formed on the 
adaptable neuromorphic circuit. With this on-chip sensorimotor integration, the 
robot learns to follow a path to the exit of a maze, while being guided by 
visually indicated paths. The ease of processability of organic neuromorphic 
electronics and their unconventional form factors, in combination with 
education-purpose robotics, showcase a promising approach of an affordable, 
versatile, and readily accessible platform for exploring, designing, and 
evaluating behavioral intelligence through decentralized sensorimotor 
integration.

Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, United States.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the way we perform advanced 
imaging. From high-resolution image reconstruction to predicting functional 
response from clinically acquired data, AI is promising to revolutionize 
clinical evaluation of lung performance, pushing the boundary in pulmonary 
functional imaging for patients suffering from respiratory conditions. In this 
review, we overview the current developments and expound on some of the 
encouraging new frontiers. We focus on the recent advances in machine learning 
and deep learning that enable reconstructing images, quantitating, and 
predicting functional responses of the lung. Finally, we shed light on the 
potential opportunities and challenges ahead in adopting AI for functional lung 
imaging in clinical settings.

IMPORTANCE: The proposed MOLEM (Management of Lesion to Exclude Melanoma) schema 
is more clinically relevant than Melanocytic Pathology Assessment Tool and 
Hierarchy for Diagnosis (MATH-Dx) for the management classification of 
melanocytic and nonmelanocytic lesions excised to exclude melanoma. A more 
standardized way of establishing diagnostic criteria will be crucial in the 
training of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms.
OBJECTIVE: To examine pathologists' variability, reliability, and confidence in 
reporting melanocytic and nonmelanocytic lesions excised to exclude melanoma 
using the MOLEM schema in a population of higher-risk patients.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study enrolled higher-risk 
patients referred to a primary care skin clinic in New South Wales, Australia, 
between April 2019 and December 2019. Baseline demographic characteristics 
including age, sex, and related clinical details (eg, history of melanoma) were 
collected. Patients with lesions suspicious for melanoma assessed by a primary 
care physician underwent clinical evaluation, dermoscopy imaging, and subsequent 
excision biopsy of the suspected lesion(s). A total of 217 lesions removed and 
prepared by conventional histologic method and stained with hematoxylin-eosin 
were reviewed by up to 9 independent pathologists for diagnosis using the MOLEM 
reporting schema. Pathologists evaluating for MOLEM schema were masked to the 
original histopathologic diagnosis.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Characteristics of the lesions were described and 
the concordance of cases per MOLEM class was assessed. Interrater agreement and 
the agreement between pathologists' ratings and the majority MOLEM diagnosis 
were calculated by Gwet AC1 with quadratic weighting applied. The diagnostic 
confidence of pathologists was then assessed.
RESULTS: A total of 197 patients were included in the study (102 [51.8%] male; 
95 [48.2%] female); mean (SD) age was 64.2 (15.8) years (range, 24-93 years). 
Overall, 217 index lesions were assessed with a total of 1516 histological 
diagnoses. Of 1516 diagnoses, 677 (44.7%) were classified as MOLEM class I; 120 
(7.9%) as MOLEM class II; 564 (37.2%) as MOLEM class III; 114 (7.5%) as MOLEM 
class IV; and 55 (3.6%) as MOLEM class V. Concordance rates per MOLEM class were 
88.6% (class I), 50.8% (class II), 76.2% (class III), 77.2% (class IV), and 
74.2% (class V). The quadratic weighted interrater agreement was 91.3%, with a 
Gwet AC1 coefficient of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.72-0.81). The quadratic weighted 
agreement between pathologists' ratings and majority MOLEM was 94.7%, with a 
Gwet AC1 coefficient of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.84-0.88). The confidence in diagnosis 
data showed a relatively high level of confidence (between 1.0 and 1.5) when 
diagnosing classes I (mean [SD], 1.3 [0.3]), IV (1.3 [0.3]) and V (1.1 [0.1]); 
while classes II (1.8 [0.2]) and III (1.5 [0.4]) were diagnosed with a lower 
level of pathologist confidence (≥1.5). The quadratic weighted interrater 
confidence rating agreement was 95.2%, with a Gwet AC1 coefficient of 0.92 (95% 
CI, 0.90-0.94) for the 1314 confidence ratings collected. The confidence 
agreement for each MOLEM class was 95.0% (class I), 93.5% (class II), 95.3% 
(class III), 96.5% (class IV), and 97.5% (class V).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The proposed MOLEM schema better reflects clinical 
practice than the MPATH-Dx schema in lesions excised to exclude melanoma by 
combining diagnoses with similar prognostic outcomes for melanocytic and 
nonmelanocytic lesions into standardized classification categories. 
Pathologists' level of confidence appeared to follow the MOLEM schema diagnostic 
concordance trend, ie, atypical naevi and melanoma in situ diagnoses were the 
least agreed upon and the most challenging for pathologists to confidently 
diagnose.

Currently, there are no internationally accepted consensus guidelines for 
pathologic evaluation of posttherapy pancreatectomy specimens. The Neoadjuvant 
Therapy Working Group of Pancreatobiliary Pathology Society was formed in 2018 
to review grossing protocols, literature, and major issues and to develop 
recommendations for pathologic evaluation of posttherapy pancreatectomy 
specimens. The working group generated the following recommendations: (1) 
Systematic and standardized grossing and sampling protocols should be adopted 
for pancreatectomy specimens for treated pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma 
(PDAC). (2) Consecutive mapping sections along the largest gross tumor dimension 
are recommended to validate tumor size by histology as required by the College 
of American Pathologists (CAP) cancer protocol. (3) Tumor size of treated PDACs 
should be measured microscopically as the largest dimension of tumor outer 
limits that is bound by viable tumor cells, including intervening stroma. (4) 
The MD Anderson grading system for tumor response has a better correlation with 
prognosis and better interobserver concordance among pathologists than does the 
CAP system. (5) A case should not be classified as a complete response unless 
the entire pancreas, peripancreatic tissues, ampulla of Vater, common bile duct, 
and duodenum adjacent to the pancreas are submitted for microscopic examination. 
(6) Future studies on tumor response of lymph node metastases, molecular and/or 
immunohistochemical markers, as well as application of artificial intelligence 
in grading tumor response of treated PDAC are needed. In summary, systematic, 
standardized pathologic evaluation, accurate tumor size measurement, and 
reproducible tumor response grading to neoadjuvant therapy are needed for 
optimal patient care. The criteria and discussions provided here may provide 
guidance towards these goals.

BACKGROUND: Deep learning (DL)-based artificial intelligence may have different 
diagnostic characteristics than human experts in medical diagnosis. As a 
data-driven knowledge system, heterogeneous population incidence in the clinical 
world is considered to cause more bias to DL than clinicians. Conversely, by 
experiencing limited numbers of cases, human experts may exhibit large 
interindividual variability. Thus, understanding how the 2 groups classify given 
data differently is an essential step for the cooperative usage of DL in 
clinical application.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate and compare the differential effects of 
clinical experience in otoendoscopic image diagnosis in both computers and 
physicians exemplified by the class imbalance problem and guide clinicians when 
utilizing decision support systems.
METHODS: We used digital otoendoscopic images of patients who visited the 
outpatient clinic in the Department of Otorhinolaryngology at Severance 
Hospital, Seoul, South Korea, from January 2013 to June 2019, for a total of 
22,707 otoendoscopic images. We excluded similar images, and 7500 otoendoscopic 
images were selected for labeling. We built a DL-based image classification 
model to classify the given image into 6 disease categories. Two test sets of 
300 images were populated: balanced and imbalanced test sets. We included 14 
clinicians (otolaryngologists and nonotolaryngology specialists including 
general practitioners) and 13 DL-based models. We used accuracy (overall and 
per-class) and kappa statistics to compare the results of individual physicians 
and the ML models.
RESULTS: Our ML models had consistently high accuracies (balanced test set: mean 
77.14%, SD 1.83%; imbalanced test set: mean 82.03%, SD 3.06%), equivalent to 
those of otolaryngologists (balanced: mean 71.17%, SD 3.37%; imbalanced: mean 
72.84%, SD 6.41%) and far better than those of nonotolaryngologists (balanced: 
mean 45.63%, SD 7.89%; imbalanced: mean 44.08%, SD 15.83%). However, ML models 
suffered from class imbalance problems (balanced test set: mean 77.14%, SD 
1.83%; imbalanced test set: mean 82.03%, SD 3.06%). This was mitigated by data 
augmentation, particularly for low incidence classes, but rare disease classes 
still had low per-class accuracies. Human physicians, despite being less 
affected by prevalence, showed high interphysician variability (ML models: 
kappa=0.83, SD 0.02; otolaryngologists: kappa=0.60, SD 0.07).
CONCLUSIONS: Even though ML models deliver excellent performance in classifying 
ear disease, physicians and ML models have their own strengths. ML models have 
consistent and high accuracy while considering only the given image and show 
bias toward prevalence, whereas human physicians have varying performance but do 
not show bias toward prevalence and may also consider extra information that is 
not images. To deliver the best patient care in the shortage of 
otolaryngologists, our ML model can serve a cooperative role for clinicians with 
diverse expertise, as long as it is kept in mind that models consider only 
images and could be biased toward prevalent diseases even after data 
augmentation.

Variants within the Neurotrophic Tyrosine Kinase Receptor Type 2 (NTRK2) gene 
have been discovered to play a role in developmental and epileptic 
encephalopathies, a group of debilitating conditions for which little is known 
about cause or treatment. Here, we determine the functional consequences of two 
variants: p.Tyr434Cys (Y434C) (located in the transmembrane domain) and 
p.Thr720Ile (T720I) (located in the catalytic domain). Wild-type and variant 
cDNAs were constructed and transfected into HEK293 cells. In cell culture, 
variant Y434C exhibited ligand-independent activation of tropomyosin-related 
kinase B (TRKB) signaling with an associated abnormal response to brain-derived 
neurotrophic factor (BDNF) stimulation and increased levels of phosphorylated 
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and ETS like-1 protein (ELK1) 
activity. Expression of variant T720I resulted in decreased TRKB signaling with 
reduced mTor activity as determined by decreased levels of phosphorylated S6. 
With the deleterious mechanisms characterized, we utilized mediKanren (a novel 
artificial intelligence tool) to identify therapeutics to compensate for the 
pathological effects. Downregulation of TRKB through inhibition with 
mediKanren-predicted compound 1NM-PP1 led to decreased MEK activity. 
Upregulation of TRKB signaling by mediKanren-predicted valproic acid led to 
subsequent increase of mTor activity. Overall, our results provide further 
characterization of the pathogenicity of these two variants in the NTRK2 gene. 
Indeed, Y434C is the first patient-specific NTRK2 variant with demonstrated 
hypermorphic activity. Furthermore, we observed that variants Y434C and T720I 
result in distinct functional consequences that require distinct therapeutic 
strategies. These data suggest the possibility that unique mutations within 
different regions of the NTRK2 gene results in separate clinical presentations, 
representing distinct genetic disorders requiring unique therapeutics.

Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is a highly complex, 
costly procedure for patients with oncologic, hematologic, genetic, and 
immunologic diseases. Demographics and socioeconomic status as well as donor 
availability and type of health care system are important factors that influence 
access to and outcomes following allo-HCT. The last decade has seen an increase 
in the numbers of allo-HCTs and teams all over the world, with no signs of 
saturation. More than 80 000 procedures are being performed annually, with 1 
million allo-HCTs estimated to take place by the end of 2024. Many factors have 
contributed to this, including increased numbers of eligible patients (older 
adults with or without comorbidities) and available donors (unrelated and 
haploidentical), improved supportive care, and decreased early and late post-HCT 
mortalities. This increase is also directly linked to macro- and microeconomic 
indicators that affect health care both regionally and globally. Despite this 
global increase in the number of allo-HCTs and transplant centers, there is an 
enormous need for increased access to and improved outcomes following allo-HCT 
in resource-constrained countries. The reduction of poverty, global economic 
changes, greater access to information, exchange of technologies, and use of 
artificial intelligence, mobile health, and telehealth are certainly creating 
unprecedented opportunities to establish collaborations and share experiences 
and thus increase patient access to allo-HCT. A specific research agenda to 
address issues of allo-HCT in resource-constrained settings is urgently 
warranted.

Vito, 89124, Reggio Calabria, Italy.

An explainable Artificial Intelligence (xAI) approach is proposed to 
longitudinally monitor subjects affected by Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) by 
using high-density electroencephalography (HD-EEG). To this end, a group of MCI 
patients was enrolled at IRCCS Centro Neurolesi Bonino Pulejo of Messina (Italy) 
within a follow-up protocol that included two evaluations steps: T0 (first 
evaluation) and T1 (three months later). At T1, four MCI patients converted to 
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and were included in the analysis as the goal of this 
work was to use xAI to detect individual changes in EEGs possibly related to the 
degeneration from MCI to AD. The proposed methodology consists in mapping 
segments of HD-EEG into channel-frequency maps by means of the power spectral 
density. Such maps are used as input to a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), 
trained to label the maps as "T0" (MCI state) or "T1" (AD state). Experimental 
results reported high intra-subject classification performance (accuracy rate up 
to 98.97% (95% confidence interval: 98.68-99.26)). Subsequently, the 
explainability of the proposed CNN is explored via a Grad-CAM approach. The 
procedure detected which EEG-channels (i.e., head region) and range of 
frequencies (i.e., sub-bands) were more active in the progression to AD. The xAI 
analysis showed that the main information is included in the delta sub-band and 
that, limited to the analyzed dataset, the highest relevant areas are: the 
left-temporal and central-frontal lobe for Sb01, the parietal lobe for Sb02, the 
left-frontal lobe for Sb03 and the left-frontotemporal region for Sb04.

Patients with schizophrenia can exhibit intelligence decline, which is an 
important element of cognitive impairment. Previous magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) studies have demonstrated that patients with schizophrenia have altered 
gray matter structures and functional connectivity associated with intelligence 
decline defined by a difference between premorbid and current intelligence 
quotients (IQs). However, it has remained unclear whether white matter 
microstructures are related to intelligence decline. In the present study, the 
indices of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) obtained from 138 patients with 
schizophrenia and 554 healthy controls were analyzed. The patients were 
classified into three subgroups based on intelligence decline: deteriorated (94 
patients), preserved (42 patients), and compromised IQ (2 patients) groups. 
Given that the DTI of each subject was acquired using either one of two 
different MRI scanners, we analyzed DTI indices separately for each scanner 
group. In the comparison between the deteriorated IQ group and the healthy 
controls, differences in some DTI indices were noted in three regions of 
interest irrespective of the MRI scanners, whereas differences in only one 
region of interest were noted between the preserved IQ group and the healthy 
controls. However, the comparisons between the deteriorated and preserved IQ 
groups did not show any reproducible differences. Together with the previous 
findings, it is thought that gray matter structures and functional connectivity 
are more promising as markers of intelligence decline in schizophrenia than 
white matter microstructures.

Emerging nonvolatile resistive switching, also known as the memristor, works 
with a distinct concept that relies mainly on the change in the composition of 
the active materials, rather than to store the charge. Particularly for 
oxide-based memristors, the switching is often governed by the random and 
unpredicted temporal/spatial migration of oxygen defects, resulting in 
possessing limitations in terms of control over conduction channel formation and 
inability to regulate hysteresis loop opening. Therefore, site specific dynamic 
control of defect concentration in the active materials can offer a unique 
opportunity to realize on-demand regulation of memory storage and artificial 
intelligence capabilities. Here, high-performance, site-specific spatially 
scalable memristor devices are fabricated by stabilizing the conduction channel 
via manipulation of oxygen defects using electron-beam irradiation. 
Specifically, the memristors exhibit highly stable and electron-beam 
dose-regulated multilevel analog hysteresis loop opening with adjustable 
switching ratios even higher than 104 . Additionally, broad modulation of neural 
activities, including short- and long-term plasticity, paired-pulse 
facilitation, spike-timing-dependent plasticity, and dynamic multipattern memory 
processing, are demonstrated. The work opens a new possibility to regulate the 
resistive switching behavior and control mimicking of neural activities, 
providing a hitherto unseen tunability in two-terminal oxide-based memristors.

Medical image registration is a vital component of many medical procedures, such 
as image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT), as it allows for more accurate 
dose-delivery and better management of side effects. Recently, the successful 
implementation of deep learning (DL) in various fields has prompted many 
research groups to apply DL to three-dimensional (3D) medical image 
registration. Several of these efforts have led to promising results. This 
review summarized the progress made in DL-based 3D image registration over the 
past 5 years and identify existing challenges and potential avenues for further 
research. The collected studies were statistically analyzed based on the region 
of interest (ROI), image modality, supervision method, and registration 
evaluation metrics. The studies were classified into three categories: deep 
iterative registration, supervised registration, and unsupervised registration. 
The studies are thoroughly reviewed and their unique contributions are 
highlighted. A summary is presented following a review of each category of 
study, discussing its advantages, challenges, and trends. Finally, the common 
challenges for all categories are discussed, and potential future research 
topics are identified.

Modern conformal beam delivery techniques require image-guidance to ensure the 
prescribed dose to be delivered as planned. Recent advances in artificial 
intelligence (AI) have greatly augmented our ability to accurately localize the 
treatment target while sparing the normal tissues. In this paper, we review the 
applications of AI-based algorithms in image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT), and 
discuss the indications of these applications to the future of clinical practice 
of radiotherapy. The benefits, limitations and some important trends in research 
and development of the AI-based IGRT techniques are also discussed. AI-based 
IGRT techniques have the potential to monitor tumor motion, reduce treatment 
uncertainty and improve treatment precision. Particularly, these techniques also 
allow more healthy tissue to be spared while keeping tumor coverage the same or 
even better.

Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to methods that improve and automate 
challenging human tasks by systematically capturing and applying relevant 
knowledge in these tasks. Over the past decades, a number of approaches have 
been developed to address different types and needs of system intelligence 
ranging from search strategies to knowledge representation and inference to 
robotic planning. In the context of radiation treatment planning, multiple AI 
approaches may be adopted to improve the planning quality and efficiency. For 
example, knowledge representation and inference methods may improve dose 
prescription by integrating and reasoning about the domain knowledge described 
in many clinical guidelines and clinical trials reports. In this review, we will 
focus on the most studied AI approach in intensity modulated radiation therapy 
(IMRT)/volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT)-machine learning (ML) and 
describe our recent efforts in applying ML to improve the quality, consistency, 
and efficiency of IMRT/VMAT planning. With the available high-quality data, we 
can build models to accurately predict critical variables for each step of the 
planning process and thus automate and improve its outcomes. Specific to the 
IMRT/VMAT planning process, we can build models for each of the four critical 
components in the process: dose-volume histogram (DVH), Dose, Fluence, and Human 
Planner. These models can be divided into two general groups. The first group 
focuses on encoding prior experience and knowledge through ML and more recently 
deep learning (DL) from prior clinical plans and using these models to predict 
the optimal DVH (DVH prediction model), or 3D dose distribution (dose prediction 
model), or fluence map (fluence map model). The goal of these models is to 
reduce or remove the trial-and-error process and guarantee consistently 
high-quality plans. The second group of models focuses on mimicking human 
planners' decision-making process (planning strategy model) during the iterative 
adjustments/guidance of the optimization engine. Each critical step of the 
IMRT/VMAT treatment planning process can be improved and automated by AI 
methods. As more training data becomes available and more sophisticated models 
are developed, we can expect that the AI methods in treatment planning will 
continue to improve accuracy, efficiency, and robustness.

BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) based radiotherapy treatment planning 
tools have gained interest in automating the treatment planning process. It is 
essential to understand their overall robustness in various clinical scenarios. 
This is an existing gap between many AI based tools and their actual clinical 
deployment. This study works to fill the gap for AI based treatment planning by 
investigating a clinical robustness assessment (CRA) tool for the AI based 
planning methods using a phantom simulation approach.
METHODS: A cylindrical phantom was created in the treatment planning system 
(TPS) with the axial dimension of 30 cm by 18 cm. Key structures involved in 
pancreas stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) including PTV25, PTV33, 
C-Loop, stomach, bowel and liver were created within the phantom. Several 
simulation scenarios were created to mimic multiple scenarios of anatomical 
changes, including displacement, expansion, rotation and combination of three. 
The goal of treatment planning was to deliver 25 Gy to PTV25 and 33 Gy to PTV33 
in 5 fractions in simultaneous integral boost (SIB) manner while limiting 
luminal organ-at-risk (OAR) max dose to be under 29 Gy. A previously developed 
deep learning based AI treatment planning tool for pancreas SBRT was identified 
as the validation object. For each scenario, the anatomy information was fed 
into the AI tool and the final fluence map associated to the plan was generated, 
which was subsequently sent to TPS for leaf sequencing and dose calculation. The 
final auto plan's quality was analyzed against the treatment planning 
constraint. The final plans' quality was further analyzed to evaluate potential 
correlation with anatomical changes using the Manhattan plot.
RESULTS: A total of 32 scenarios were simulated in this study. For all 
scenarios, the mean PTV25 V25Gy of the AI based auto plans was 96.7% while mean 
PTV33 V33Gy was 82.2%. Large variation (16.3%) in PTV33 V33Gy was observed due 
to anatomical variations, a.k.a. proximity of luminal structure to PTV33. Mean 
max dose was 28.55, 27.68 and 24.63 Gy for C-Loop, bowel and stomach, 
respectively. Using D0.03cc as max dose surrogate, the value was 28.03, 27.12 
and 23.84 Gy for C-Loop, bowel and stomach, respectively. Max dose constraint of 
29 Gy was achieved for 81.3% cases for C-Loop and stomach, and 78.1% for bowel. 
Using D0.03cc as max dose surrogate, the passing rate was 90.6% for C-Loop, and 
81.3% for bowel and stomach. Manhattan plot revealed high correlation between 
the OAR over dose and the minimal distance between the PTV33 and OAR.
CONCLUSIONS: The results showed promising robustness of the pancreas SBRT AI 
tool, providing important evidence of its readiness for clinical implementation. 
The established workflow could guide the process of assuring clinical readiness 
of future AI based treatment planning tools.

BACKGROUND: Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for liver cancer has 
shown promising therapeutic effects. Effective treatment relies not only on the 
precise delivery provided by image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) but also high 
dose gradient formed around the treatment volume to spare functional liver 
tissue, which is highly dependent on the beam/arc angle selection. In this 
study, we aim to develop a decision support model to learn human planner's beam 
navigation approach for beam angle/arc angle selection for liver SBRT.
METHODS: A total of 27 liver SBRT/HIGRT patients (10 IMRT, 17 VMAT/DCA) were 
included in this study. A dosimetric budget index was defined for each beam 
angle/control point considering dose penetration through the patient body and 
liver tissue. Optimal beam angle setting (beam angles for IMRT and 
start/terminal angle for VMAT/DCA) was determined by minimizing the loss 
function defined as the sum of total dosimetric budget index and beam span 
penalty function. Leave-one-out validation was exercised on all 27 cases while 
weighting coefficients in the loss function was tuned in nested cross 
validation. To compare the efficacy of the model, a model plan was generated 
using automatically generated beam setting while retaining the original 
optimization constraints in the clinical plan. Model plan was normalized to the 
same planning target volume (PTV) V100% as the clinical plans. Dosimetric 
endpoints including PTV D98%, D2%, liver V20Gy and total MU were compared 
between two plan groups. Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test was performed with the null 
hypothesis being that no difference exists between two plan groups.
RESULTS: Beam setting prediction was instantaneous. Mean PTV D98% was 91.3% and 
91.3% (P=0.566), while mean PTV D2% was 107.9% and 108.1% (P=0.164) for clinical 
plan and model plan respectively. Liver V20Gy showed no significant difference 
(P=0.590) with 23.3% for clinical plan and 23.4% for the model plan. Total MU is 
comparable (P=0.256) between the clinical plan (avg. 2,389.6) and model plan 
(avg. 2,319.6).
CONCLUSIONS: The evidence driven beam setting model yielded similar plan quality 
as hand-crafted clinical plan. It is capable of capturing human's knowledge in 
beam selection decision making. This model could facilitate decision making for 
beam angle selection while eliminating lengthy trial-and-error process of 
adjusting beam setting during liver SBRT treatment planning.

BACKGROUND: In the radiotherapy of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) is widely used to delineate tumor area more accurately. 
While MRI offers the higher soft tissue contrast, patient positioning and couch 
correction based on bony image fusion of computed tomography (CT) is also 
necessary. There is thus an urgent need to obtain a high image contrast between 
bone and soft tissue to facilitate target delineation and patient positioning 
for NPC radiotherapy. In this paper, our aim is to develop a novel image 
conversion between the CT and MRI modalities to obtain clear bone and soft 
tissue images simultaneously, here called bone-enhanced MRI (BeMRI).
METHODS: Thirty-five patients were retrospectively selected for this study. All 
patients underwent clinical CT simulation and 1.5T MRI within the same week in 
Shenzhen Second People's Hospital. To synthesize BeMRI, two deep learning 
networks, U-Net and CycleGAN, were constructed to transform MRI to synthetic CT 
(sCT) images. Each network used 28 patients' images as the training set, while 
the remaining 7 patients were used as the test set (~1/5 of all datasets). The 
bone structure from the sCT was then extracted by the threshold-based method and 
embedded in the corresponding part of the MRI image to generate the BeMRI image. 
To evaluate the performance of these networks, the following metrics were 
applied: mean absolute error (MAE), structural similarity index (SSIM), and peak 
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR).
RESULTS: In our experiments, both deep learning models achieved good performance 
and were able to effectively extract bone structure from MRI. Specifically, the 
supervised U-Net model achieved the best results with the lowest overall average 
MAE of 125.55 (P<0.05) and produced the highest SSIM of 0.89 and PSNR of 23.84. 
These results indicate that BeMRI can display bone structure in higher contrast 
than conventional MRI.
CONCLUSIONS: A new image modality BeMRI, which is a composite image of CT and 
MRI, was proposed. With high image contrast of both bone structure and soft 
tissues, BeMRI will facilitate tumor localization and patient positioning and 
eliminate the need to frequently check between separate MRI and CT images during 
NPC radiotherapy.

Anesthesiologists commonly use video bronchoscopy to facilitate intubation or 
confirm the location of the endotracheal tube; however, depth and orientation in 
the bronchial tree can often be confused because anesthesiologists cannot trace 
the airway from the oropharynx when it is performed using an endotracheal tube. 
Moreover, the decubitus position is often used in certain surgeries. Although it 
occurs rarely, the misinterpretation of tube location can cause accidental 
extubation or endobronchial intubation, which can lead to hyperinflation. Thus, 
video bronchoscopy with a decision supporting system using artificial 
intelligence would be useful in the anesthesiologic process. In this study, we 
aimed to develop an artificial intelligence model robust to rotation and 
covering using video bronchoscopy images. We collected video bronchoscopic 
images from an institutional database. Collected images were automatically 
labeled by an optical character recognition engine as the carina and left/right 
main bronchus. Except 180 images for the evaluation dataset, 80% were randomly 
allocated to the training dataset. The remaining images were assigned to the 
validation and test datasets in a 7:3 ratio. Random image rotation and circular 
cropping were applied. Ten kinds of pretrained models with < 25 million 
parameters were trained on the training and validation datasets. The model 
showing the best prediction accuracy for the test dataset was selected as the 
final model. Six human experts reviewed the evaluation dataset for the inference 
of anatomical locations to compare its performance with that of the final model. 
In the experiments, 8688 images were prepared and assigned to the evaluation 
(180), training (6806), validation (1191), and test (511) datasets. The 
EfficientNetB1 model showed the highest accuracy (0.86) and was selected as the 
final model. For the evaluation dataset, the final model showed better 
performance (accuracy, 0.84) than almost all human experts (0.38, 0.44, 0.51, 
0.68, and 0.63), and only the most-experienced pulmonologist showed performance 
comparable (0.82) with that of the final model. The performance of human experts 
was generally proportional to their experiences. The performance difference 
between anesthesiologists and pulmonologists was marked in discrimination of the 
right main bronchus. Using bronchoscopic images, our model could distinguish 
anatomical locations among the carina and both main bronchi under random 
rotation and covering. The performance was comparable with that of the 
most-experienced human expert. This model can be a basis for designing a 
clinical decision support system with video bronchoscopy.

Physical activity (PA) has numerous health benefits. Personalized coaching may 
increase adherence to PA recommendations, but it is challenging to deliver 
personalized coaching in a scalable manner. The objective of our study was to 
determine whether novel artificially intelligent (AI) coaching interventions 
increase PA among overweight or obese, physically inactive cancer survivors 
compared to a control arm that receives health information. We conducted a 
single-center, three-arm randomized trial with equal allocation to (1) 
voice-assisted AI coaching delivered by smart speaker (MyCoach), (2) autonomous 
AI coaching delivered by text message (SmartText), and (3) control. Data 
collection was automated via sensors and voice technology, effectively masking 
outcome ascertainment. The primary outcome was change in mean steps per day from 
baseline to the end of follow-up at 4 weeks. Of the 42 randomized participants, 
91% were female, and 36% were Black; mean age was 62.1 years, and mean BMI was 
32.9 kg/m2. The majority were breast cancer survivors (85.7%). At the end of 4 
weeks follow-up, steps increased in the MyCoach arm by an average of 3618.2 
steps/day; the net gain in this arm was significantly greater [net 
difference = 3568.9 steps/day (95% CI: 1483-5655), P value <0.001] compared to 
control arm, and [net difference = 2160.6 steps/day (95% CI: 11-4310), P value 
0.049] compared to SmartText. In conclusion, AI-based voice-assisted coaching 
shows promise as a practical method of delivering scalable, individualized 
coaching to increase physical activity in sedentary cancer survivors. Additional 
research is needed to replicate these findings in a broader population of cancer 
survivors and to investigate the effects of these interventions in the general 
population.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03212079, July 11, 2017,

Education is central to the acquisition of knowledge, such as when children 
learn new concepts. It is unknown, however, whether educational differences 
impact not only what concepts children learn, but how those concepts come to be 
represented in semantic memory-a system that supports higher cognitive 
functions, such as creative thinking. Here we leverage computational network 
science tools to study hidden knowledge structures of 67 Swiss schoolchildren 
from two distinct educational backgrounds-Montessori and traditional, matched on 
socioeconomic factors and nonverbal intelligence-to examine how educational 
experience shape semantic memory and creative thinking. We find that children 
experiencing Montessori education show a more flexible semantic network 
structure (high connectivity/short paths between concepts, less modularity) 
alongside higher scores on creative thinking tests. The findings indicate that 
education impacts how children represent concepts in semantic memory and suggest 
that different educational experiences can affect higher cognitive functions, 
including creative thinking.

OBJECTIVES: Different stakeholders may hold varying attitudes towards artificial 
intelligence (AI) applications in healthcare, which may constrain their 
acceptance if AI developers fail to take them into account. We set out to 
ascertain evidence of the attitudes of clinicians, consumers, managers, 
researchers, regulators and industry towards AI applications in healthcare.
METHODS: We undertook an exploratory analysis of articles whose titles or 
abstracts contained the terms 'artificial intelligence' or 'AI' and 'medical' or 
'healthcare' and 'attitudes', 'perceptions', 'opinions', 'views', 
'expectations'. Using a snowballing strategy, we searched PubMed and Google 
Scholar for articles published 1 January 2010 through 31 May 2021. We selected 
articles relating to non-robotic clinician-facing AI applications used to 
support healthcare-related tasks or decision-making.
RESULTS: Across 27 studies, attitudes towards AI applications in healthcare, in 
general, were positive, more so for those with direct experience of AI, but 
provided certain safeguards were met. AI applications which automated data 
interpretation and synthesis were regarded more favourably by clinicians and 
consumers than those that directly influenced clinical decisions or potentially 
impacted clinician-patient relationships. Privacy breaches and personal 
liability for AI-related error worried clinicians, while loss of clinician 
oversight and inability to fully share in decision-making worried consumers. 
Both clinicians and consumers wanted AI-generated advice to be trustworthy, 
while industry groups emphasised AI benefits and wanted more data, funding and 
regulatory certainty.
DISCUSSION: Certain expectations of AI applications were common to many 
stakeholder groups from which a set of dependencies can be defined.
CONCLUSION: Stakeholders differ in some but not all of their attitudes towards 
AI. Those developing and implementing applications should consider policies and 
processes that bridge attitudinal disconnects between different stakeholders.

Radiation therapy is a complex process involving multiple professionals and 
steps from simulation to treatment planning to delivery, and these procedures 
are prone to error. Additionally, the imaging and treatment delivery equipment 
in radiotherapy is highly complex and interconnected and represents another risk 
point in the quality of care. Numerous quality assurance tasks are carried out 
to ensure quality and to detect and prevent potential errors in the process of 
care. Recent developments in artificial intelligence provide potential tools to 
the radiation oncology community to improve the efficiency and performance of 
quality assurance efforts. Targets for artificial intelligence enhancement 
include the quality assurance of treatment plans, target and tissue structure 
delineation used in the plans, delivery of the plans and the radiotherapy 
delivery equipment itself. Here we review recent developments of artificial 
intelligence applications that aim to improve quality assurance processes in 
radiation therapy and discuss some of the challenges and limitations that 
require further development work to realise the potential of artificial 
intelligence for quality assurance.

BACKGROUND: Wide-ranging concerns exist regarding the use of black-box modelling 
methods in sensitive contexts such as healthcare. Despite performance gains and 
hype, uptake of artificial intelligence (AI) is hindered by these concerns. 
Explainable AI is thought to help alleviate these concerns. However, existing 
definitions for explainable are not forming a solid foundation for this work.
METHODS: We critique recent reviews on the literature regarding: the agency of 
an AI within a team; mental models, especially as they apply to healthcare, and 
the practical aspects of their elicitation; and existing and current definitions 
of explainability, especially from the perspective of AI researchers. On the 
basis of this literature, we create a new definition of explainable, and 
supporting terms, providing definitions that can be objectively evaluated. 
Finally, we apply the new definition of explainable to three existing models, 
demonstrating how it can apply to previous research, and providing guidance for 
future research on the basis of this definition.
RESULTS: Existing definitions of explanation are premised on global 
applicability and don't address the question 'understandable by whom?'. 
Eliciting mental models can be likened to creating explainable AI if one 
considers the AI as a member of a team. On this basis, we define explainability 
in terms of the context of the model, comprising the purpose, audience, and 
language of the model and explanation. As examples, this definition is applied 
to regression models, neural nets, and human mental models in operating-room 
teams.
CONCLUSIONS: Existing definitions of explanation have limitations for ensuring 
that the concerns for practical applications are resolved. Defining 
explainability in terms of the context of their application forces evaluations 
to be aligned with the practical goals of the model. Further, it will allow 
researchers to explicitly distinguish between explanations for technical and lay 
audiences, allowing different evaluations to be applied to each.

BACKGROUND: Deficits in cognitive performance are reported in patients with 
anxiety disorders, but research is limited and inconsistent. We aimed to 
investigate cross-sectional associations between cognitive function, with focus 
on executive function, and anxiety severity in primary care patients diagnosed 
with anxiety disorders.
METHODS: 189 Swedish patients aged 18-65 years (31% men) with anxiety disorders 
diagnosed according to Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview were 
included. Severity of anxiety was assessed using Beck Anxiety Inventory 
self-assessment scale. Digit span, block design and matrix reasoning tests from 
the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale IV, and the design fluency test from the 
Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System were used. Multivariable linear 
regression models were applied to investigate the relationship of anxiety 
severity and cognitive functioning. Comparisons were also performed to a normed 
non-clinical population, using the Wilcoxon signed rank test.
RESULTS: More severe anxiety was associated with lower digit span test scores 
(R2 = 0.109, B = -0.040, p = 0.018), but not with block design, matrix reasoning 
or design fluency tests scores, after adjustment for comorbid major depression 
in a multivariable model. When compared to a normed population, patients with 
anxiety performed significantly lower on the block design, digit span forward, 
digit span sequencing and matrix reasoning tests.
CONCLUSIONS: Severity of anxiety among patients with anxiety disorder was 
associated with executive functions related to working memory, independently of 
comorbid major depression, but not with lower fluid intelligence. A further 
understanding of the executive behavioral control in patients with anxiety could 
allow for more tailored treatment strategies including medication, therapy and 
interventions targeted to improve specific cognitive domains.

Review.

Personality is one of the most crucial aspects of human life, since it 
influences all human behaviours in both personal and social life, and might also 
trigger important conflicts with a person's surroundings in the setting of 
incompatible traits and characteristics. It is true that 'one must be born' for 
a certain medical specialty, but several components of personality might be 
educated with proper training. Increased levels of Conscientiousness, 
Agreeableness, and Openness associated with lower levels of Neuroticism might 
represent the key combination for achieving professional satisfaction in the 
medical profession. Medical students should receive proper interprofessional 
education, since effective interprofessional relationships among healthcare 
providers definitely improve patients' safety. Empathy contributes to effective 
patient-physician communication, improving patient trust, compliance, and 
satisfaction, being positively correlated with Openness, Agreeableness, 
Conscientiousness and Extraversion. Emotional intelligence-the capacity to 
respond to one's own and others' emotions-was proven to contribute, in a 
synergistic way with empathy, to increasing empathic ability. Clinical 
communication skills represent a key component in medical students in order to 
achieve the best patient care, and they are certainly related and/or influenced 
by empathy, interprofessional collaboration skills, emotional intelligence and, 
especially, personality traits. Taking into account the complex interactions 
mentioned above, the implementation of effective courses based on these concepts 
in medical students, intending to promote the development of clinical 
communication skills, represents a real emergency, since it might result in a 
reduction in medical errors and subsequent related deaths. A thorough 
understanding of students' personality is mandatory before designing these 
courses in order to provide a training tailored to their personality styles.

This study aimed to examine relationships and group differences among adult 
people's (aged 18-74) physical activity (PA), expression of stress, depression, 
emotional intelligence (EI), logical thinking (LT), and overall health 
assessment. Two hypotheses were formulated before the study. The first 
hypothesis is that overweight and obesity in young adults (18 to 34 years) 
females and males, in particular, should increase sharply and this should be 
associated with decreased PA, abruptly deteriorating subject health, increased 
stress, depression, and poorer emotion management and EI. Second hypothesis: We 
further thought that the better people's reflective thinking, the more they 
should live a healthier life (e.g., exercise more and eat healthier), their 
overweight and obesity should be small or none. We aimed to confirm or reject 
these two hypotheses. We applied a quantitative cross-sectional study design. 
The study results revealed that during the lifespan of 18-24 and 25-34 years 
(young adults) there was a sharp increase in overweight and obesity, a decrease 
in PA (and especially vigorous physical activity (VPA)) (and this was 
particularly evident in the male), while research participants felt less stress 
and depression, subjective assessment of health did not change, and EI increased 
steadily with age (18-24 to 65-74 years). The higher the EI of the research 
participants from 18-24 to 65-74 years of age the higher their 
moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), the less stress and depression 
they felt. Based on the results, it can be said that both females and males 
prefer PA "with a hot heart rather than a cold mind." We base this conclusion on 
the fact that females and males who have the highest EI also have the highest 
MVPA while LT is not associated with MVPA.

hGLUTEN is a technological solution capable of detecting gluten and spoiled 
food. We measured the social impact of the hGLUTEN tool using two Likert scale 
surveys with two groups: professionals (engineers/chefs) and end-users. These 
data have been assessed in accordance with the social impact indicators defined 
for the Key Impact Pathways introduced by the European Commission for Horizon 
Europe and the criteria of the Social Impact Open Repository (SIOR). A total of 
85% of users, 100% of engineers and 68% of professional chefs consider it very 
relevant to participate and give their opinion in research projects, which shows 
the increasingly high level of involvement of the general population. A total of 
88% of users were unaware of other applications that detect gluten and were more 
dependent on guidelines provided by allergy associations and expiry dates of 
foodstuffs. In addition, only 5% of professional chefs said they were aware of 
other technology capable of detecting gluten in food, which may indicate a large 
economic market and good commercialisation possibilities for the tool in the 
future. Finally, the inclusion of tools to motivate users to promote it has been 
identified as an area for improvement, which could mean that it should be made 
more visible in the media to increase its impact and influence.

Denmark.

Although the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare is still in its 
early stages, it is important to understand the factors influencing its 
adoption. Using a qualitative multi-case study of three hospitals in China, we 
explored the research of factors affecting AI adoption from a social power 
perspective with consideration of the learning algorithm abilities of AI 
systems. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews, participative 
observations, and document analysis, and analyzed using NVivo 11. We classified 
six social powers into knowledge-based and non-knowledge-based power structures, 
revealing a social power pattern related to the learning algorithm ability of 
AI.

Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) of the prostate is used by 
radiologists to identify, score, and stage abnormalities that may correspond to 
clinically significant prostate cancer (CSPCa). Automatic assessment of prostate 
mpMRI using artificial intelligence algorithms may facilitate a reduction in 
missed cancers and unnecessary biopsies, an increase in inter-observer agreement 
between radiologists, and an improvement in reporting quality. In this work, we 
introduce AutoProstate, a deep learning-powered framework for automatic 
MRI-based prostate cancer assessment. AutoProstate comprises of three modules: 
Zone-Segmenter, CSPCa-Segmenter, and Report-Generator. Zone-Segmenter segments 
the prostatic zones on T2-weighted imaging, CSPCa-Segmenter detects and segments 
CSPCa lesions using biparametric MRI, and Report-Generator generates an 
automatic web-based report containing four sections: Patient Details, Prostate 
Size and PSA Density, Clinically Significant Lesion Candidates, and Findings 
Summary. In our experiment, AutoProstate was trained using the publicly 
available PROSTATEx dataset, and externally validated using the PICTURE dataset. 
Moreover, the performance of AutoProstate was compared to the performance of an 
experienced radiologist who prospectively read PICTURE dataset cases. In 
comparison to the radiologist, AutoProstate showed statistically significant 
improvements in prostate volume and prostate-specific antigen density 
estimation. Furthermore, AutoProstate matched the CSPCa lesion detection 
sensitivity of the radiologist, which is paramount, but produced more false 
positive detections.

Machine-intelligence platforms for the prediction of the probability of 
malignant transformation of oral potentially malignant disorders are required as 
adjunctive decision-making platforms in contemporary clinical practice. This 
study utilized time-to-event learning models to predict malignant transformation 
in oral leukoplakia and oral lichenoid lesions. A total of 1098 patients with 
oral white lesions from two institutions were included in this study. In all, 26 
features available from electronic health records were used to train four 
learning algorithms-Cox-Time, DeepHit, DeepSurv, random survival forest 
(RSF)-and one standard statistical method-Cox proportional hazards model. 
Discriminatory performance, calibration of survival estimates, and model 
stability were assessed using a concordance index (c-index), integrated Brier 
score (IBS), and standard deviation of the averaged c-index and IBS following 
training cross-validation. This study found that DeepSurv (c-index: 0.95, IBS: 
0.04) and RSF (c-index: 0.91, IBS: 0.03) were the two outperforming models based 
on discrimination and calibration following internal validation. However, 
DeepSurv was more stable than RSF upon cross-validation. External validation 
confirmed the utility of DeepSurv for discrimination (c-index-0.82 vs. 0.73) and 
RSF for individual survival estimates (0.18 vs. 0.03). We deployed the DeepSurv 
model to encourage incipient application in clinical practice. Overall, 
time-to-event models are successful in predicting the malignant transformation 
of oral leukoplakia and oral lichenoid lesions.

The future of healthcare is an organic blend of technology, innovation, and 
human connection. As artificial intelligence (AI) is gradually becoming a go-to 
technology in healthcare to improve efficiency and outcomes, we must understand 
our limitations. We should realize that our goal is not only to provide faster 
and more efficient care, but also to deliver an integrated solution to ensure 
that the care is fair and not biased to a group of sub-population. In this 
context, the field of cardio-cerebrovascular diseases, which encompasses a wide 
range of conditions-from heart failure to stroke-has made some advances to 
provide assistive tools to care providers. This article aimed to provide an 
overall thematic review of recent development focusing on various AI 
applications in cardio-cerebrovascular diseases to identify gaps and potential 
areas of improvement. If well designed, technological engines have the potential 
to improve healthcare access and equitability while reducing overall costs, 
diagnostic errors, and disparity in a system that affects patients and providers 
and strives for efficiency.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown promising results in digestive endoscopy, 
especially in capsule endoscopy (CE). However, some physicians still have some 
difficulties and fear the advent of this technology. We aimed to evaluate the 
perceptions and current sentiments toward the use of AI in CE. An online survey 
questionnaire was sent to an audience of gastroenterologists. In addition, 
several European national leaders of the International CApsule endoscopy 
REsearch (I CARE) Group were asked to disseminate an online survey among their 
national communities of CE readers (CER). The survey included 32 questions 
regarding general information, perceptions of AI, and its use in daily life, 
medicine, endoscopy, and CE. Among 380 European gastroenterologists who answered 
this survey, 333 (88%) were CERs. The mean average time length of experience in 
CE reading was 9.9 years (0.5-22). A majority of CERs agreed that AI would 
positively impact CE, shorten CE reading time, and help standardize reporting in 
CE and characterize lesions seen in CE. Nevertheless, in the foreseeable future, 
a majority of CERs disagreed with the complete replacement all CE reading by AI. 
Most CERs believed in the high potential of AI for becoming a valuable tool for 
automated diagnosis and for shortening the reading time. Currently, the 
perception is that AI will not replace CE reading.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major cause of heart failure and stroke. The early 
maintenance of sinus rhythm has been shown to reduce major cardiovascular 
endpoints, yet is difficult to achieve. For instance, it is unclear how 
discoveries at the genetic and cellular level can be used to tailor 
pharmacotherapy. For non-pharmacologic therapy, pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) 
remains the cornerstone of rhythm control, yet has suboptimal success. Improving 
these therapies will likely require a multifaceted approach that personalizes 
therapy based on mechanisms measured in individuals across biological scales. We 
review AF mechanisms from cell-to-organ-to-patient from this perspective of 
personalized medicine, linking them to potential clinical indices and 
biomarkers, and discuss how these data could influence therapy. We conclude by 
describing approaches to improve ablation, including the emergence of several 
mapping systems that are in use today.

One of the major health concerns for human society is skin cancer. When the 
pigments producing skin color turn carcinogenic, this disease gets contracted. A 
skin cancer diagnosis is a challenging process for dermatologists as many skin 
cancer pigments may appear similar in appearance. Hence, early detection of 
lesions (which form the base of skin cancer) is definitely critical and useful 
to completely cure the patients suffering from skin cancer. Significant progress 
has been made in developing automated tools for the diagnosis of skin cancer to 
assist dermatologists. The worldwide acceptance of artificial 
intelligence-supported tools has permitted usage of the enormous collection of 
images of lesions and benevolent sores approved by histopathology. This paper 
performs a comparative analysis of six different transfer learning nets for 
multi-class skin cancer classification by taking the HAM10000 dataset. We used 
replication of images of classes with low frequencies to counter the imbalance 
in the dataset. The transfer learning nets that were used in the analysis were 
VGG19, InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2, ResNet50, Xception, and MobileNet. 
Results demonstrate that replication is suitable for this task, achieving high 
classification accuracies and F-measures with lower false negatives. It is 
inferred that Xception Net outperforms the rest of the transfer learning nets 
used for the study, with an accuracy of 90.48. It also has the highest recall, 
precision, and F-Measure values.

Current Internet of Things (IoT) stacks are frequently focused on handling an 
increasing volume of data that require a sophisticated interpretation through 
analytics to improve decision making and thus generate business value. In this 
paper, a cognitive IoT architecture based on FIWARE IoT principles is presented. 
The architecture incorporates a new cognitive component that enables the 
incorporation of intelligent services to the FIWARE framework, allowing to 
modernize IoT infrastructures with Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies. 
This allows to extend the effective life of the legacy system, using existing 
assets and reducing costs. Using the architecture, a cognitive service capable 
of predicting with high accuracy the vessel port arrival is developed and 
integrated in a legacy sea traffic management solution. The cognitive service 
uses automatic identification system (AIS) and maritime oceanographic data to 
predict time of arrival of ships. The validation has been carried out using the 
port of Valencia. The results indicate that the incorporation of AI into the 
legacy system allows to predict the arrival time with higher accuracy, thus 
improving the efficiency of port operations. Moreover, the architecture is 
generic, allowing an easy integration of the cognitive services in other 
domains.

Recent scientific and technological advancements driven by the Internet of 
Things (IoT), Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), 
distributed computing and data communication technologies have opened up a vast 
range of opportunities in many scientific fields-spanning from fast, reliable 
and efficient data communication to large-scale cloud/edge computing and 
intelligent big data analytics. Technological innovations and developments in 
these areas have also enabled many opportunities in the space industry. The 
successful Mars landing of NASA's Perseverance rover on 18 February 2021 
represents another giant leap for humankind in space exploration. Emerging 
research and developments of connectivity and computing technologies in IoT for 
space/non-terrestrial environments is expected to yield significant benefits in 
the near future. This survey paper presents a broad overview of the area and 
provides a look-ahead of the opportunities made possible by IoT and space-based 
technologies. We first survey the current developments of IoT and space 
industry, and identify key challenges and opportunities in these areas. We then 
review the state-of-the-art and discuss future opportunities for IoT 
developments, deployment and integration to support future endeavors in space 
exploration.

The Internet of Things (IoT) allows the sharing of information among devices in 
a network. Hardware evolutions have enabled the employment of cognitive agents 
on top of such devices, which could help to adopt pro-active and autonomous IoT 
systems. Agents are autonomous entities from Artificial Intelligence capable of 
sensing (perceiving) the environment where they are situated. Then, with these 
captured perceptions, they can reason and act pro-actively. However, some agent 
approaches are created for a specific domain or application when dealing with 
embedded systems and hardware interfacing. In addition, the agent architecture 
can compromise the system's performance because of the number of perceptions 
that agents can access. This paper presents three engineering approaches for 
creating IoT Objects using Embedded Multi-agent systems (MAS)-as cognitive 
systems at the edge of an IoT network-connecting, acting, and sharing 
information with a re-engineered IoT architecture based on the Sensor as a 
Service model. These engineering approaches use Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) 
agents and the JaCaMo framework. In addition, it is expected to diversify the 
designers' choice in applying embedded MAS in IoT systems. We also present a 
case study to validate the whole re-engineered architecture and the approaches. 
Moreover, some performance tests and comparisons are also presented. The study 
case shows that each approach is more or less suitable depending on the domain 
tackled. The performance tests show that the re-engineered IoT architecture is 
scalable and that there are some trade-offs in adopting one or another approach. 
The contributions of this paper are an architecture for sharing resources in an 
IoT network, the use of embedded MAS on top IoT Objects, and three engineering 
approaches considering agent and artifacts dimensions.

Ultrasonic guided waves are sensitive to many different types of defects and 
have been studied for defect recognition in rail. However, most fault 
recognition algorithms need to extract features from the time domain, frequency 
domain, or time-frequency domain based on experience or professional knowledge. 
This paper proposes a new method for identifying many different types of rail 
defects. The segment principal components analysis (S-PCA) is developed to 
extract characteristics from signals collected by sensors located at different 
positions. Then, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model is used to identify 
different defects depending on the features extracted. Combining simulations and 
experiments of the rails with different kinds of defects are established to 
verify the effectiveness of the proposed defect identification techniques, such 
as crack, corrosion, and transverse crack under the shelling. There are nine 
channels of the excitation-reception to acquire guided wave detection signals. 
The results show that the defect classification accuracy rates are 96.29% and 
96.15% for combining multiple signals, such as the method of single-point 
excitation and multi-point reception, or the method of multi-point excitation 
and reception at a single point.

Currently, the target detection based on convolutional neural network plays an 
important role in image recognition, speech recognition and other fields. 
However, the current network model features a complex structure, a huge number 
of parameters and resources. These conditions make it difficult to apply in 
embedded devices with limited computational capabilities and extreme sensitivity 
to power consumption. In this regard, the application scenarios of deep learning 
are limited. This paper proposes a real-time detection scheme for cook assistant 
overalls based on the Hi3559A embedded processor. With YOLOv3 as the benchmark 
network, this scheme fully mobilizes the hardware acceleration resources through 
the network model optimization and the parallel processing technology of the 
processor, and improves the network reasoning speed, so that the embedded device 
can complete the task of real-time detection on the local device. The 
experimental results show that through the purposeful cropping, segmentation and 
in-depth optimization of the neural network according to the specific processor, 
the neural network can recognize the image accurately. In an application 
environment where the power consumption is only 5.5 W, the recognition speed of 
the neural network on the embedded end is increased to about 28 frames (the 
design requirement was to achieve a recognition speed of 25 frames or more), so 
that the optimized network can be effectively applied in the back kitchen 
overalls identification scene.

Operational modes of a process are described by a number of relevant features 
that are indicative of the state of the process. Hundreds of sensors 
continuously collect data in industrial systems, which shows how the 
relationship between different variables changes over time and identifies 
different modes of operation. Gas turbines' operational modes are usually 
defined regarding their expected energy production, and most research works 
either are focused a priori on obtaining these modes solely based on one 
variable, the active load, or assume a fixed number of states and build up 
predictive models to classify new situations as belonging to the predefined 
operational modes. However, in this work, we take into account all available 
parameters based on sensors' data because other factors can influence the system 
status, leading to the identification of a priori unknown operational modes. 
Furthermore, for gas turbine management, a key issue is to detect these modes 
using a real-time monitoring system. Our approach is based on using unsupervised 
machine learning techniques, specifically an ensemble of clusters to discover 
consistent clusters, which group data into similar groups, and to generate in an 
automatic way their description. This description, upon interpretation by 
experts, becomes identified and characterized as operational modes of an 
industrial process without any kind of a priori bias of what should be the 
operational modes obtained. Our proposed methodology can discover and identify 
unknown operational modes through data-driven models. The methodology was tested 
in our case study with Siemens gas turbine data. From available sensors' data, 
clusters descriptions were obtained in an automatic way from aggregated 
clusters. They improved the quality of partitions tuning one consistency 
parameter and excluding outlier clusters by defining filtering thresholds. 
Finally, operational modes and/or sub-operational modes were identified with the 
interpretation of the clusters description by process experts, who evaluated the 
results very positively.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the revolutionary paradigm to empower sixth 
generation (6G) edge computing based e-healthcare for everyone. Thus, this 
research aims to promote an AI-based cost-effective and efficient healthcare 
application. The cyber physical system (CPS) is a key player in the internet 
world where humans and their personal devices such as cell phones, laptops, 
wearables, etc., facilitate the healthcare environment. The data extracting, 
examining and monitoring strategies from sensors and actuators in the entire 
medical landscape are facilitated by cloud-enabled technologies for absorbing 
and accepting the entire emerging wave of revolution. The efficient and accurate 
examination of voluminous data from the sensor devices poses restrictions in 
terms of bandwidth, delay and energy. Due to the heterogeneous nature of the 
Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), the driven healthcare system must be smart, 
interoperable, convergent, and reliable to provide pervasive and cost-effective 
healthcare platforms. Unfortunately, because of higher power consumption and 
lesser packet delivery rate, achieving interoperable, convergent, and reliable 
transmission is challenging in connected healthcare. In such a scenario, this 
paper has fourfold major contributions. The first contribution is the 
development of a single chip wearable electrocardiogram (ECG) with the support 
of an analog front end (AFE) chip model (i.e., ADS1292R) for gathering the ECG 
data to examine the health status of elderly or chronic patients with the 
IoT-based cyber physical system (CPS). The second proposes a fuzzy-based 
sustainable, interoperable, and reliable algorithm (FSIRA), which is an 
intelligent and self-adaptive decision-making approach to prioritize emergency 
and critical patients in association with the selected parameters for improving 
healthcare quality at reasonable costs. The third is the proposal of a specific 
cloud-based architecture for mobile and connected healthcare. The fourth is the 
identification of the right balance between reliability, packet loss ratio, 
convergence, latency, interoperability, and throughput to support an adaptive 
IoMT driven connected healthcare. It is examined and observed that our proposed 
approaches outperform the conventional techniques by providing high reliability, 
high convergence, interoperability, and a better foundation to analyze and 
interpret the accuracy in systems from a medical health aspect. As for the IoMT, 
an enabled healthcare cloud is the key ingredient on which to focus, as it also 
faces the big hurdle of less bandwidth, more delay and energy drain. Thus, we 
propose the mathematical trade-offs between bandwidth, interoperability, 
reliability, delay, and energy dissipation for IoMT-oriented smart healthcare 
over a 6G platform.

The global pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused millions of 
deaths and affected the livelihood of many more people. Early and rapid 
detection of COVID-19 is a challenging task for the medical community, but it is 
also crucial in stopping the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Prior 
substantiation of artificial intelligence (AI) in various fields of science has 
encouraged researchers to further address this problem. Various medical imaging 
modalities including X-ray, computed tomography (CT) and ultrasound (US) using 
AI techniques have greatly helped to curb the COVID-19 outbreak by assisting 
with early diagnosis. We carried out a systematic review on state-of-the-art AI 
techniques applied with X-ray, CT, and US images to detect COVID-19. In this 
paper, we discuss approaches used by various authors and the significance of 
these research efforts, the potential challenges, and future trends related to 
the implementation of an AI system for disease detection during the COVID-19 
pandemic.

Exploiting Smart Meter Power Consumption Measurements for Human Activity 
Recognition (HAR) with a Motif-Detection-Based Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring 
(NILM) Approach.

Numerous approaches exist for disaggregating power consumption data, referred to 
as non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM). Whereas NILM is primarily used for 
energy monitoring, we intend to disaggregate a household's power consumption to 
detect human activity in the residence. Therefore, this paper presents a novel 
approach for NILM, which uses pattern recognition on the raw power waveform of 
the smart meter measurements to recognize individual household appliance 
actions. The presented NILM approach is capable of (near) real-time appliance 
action detection in a streaming setting, using edge computing. It is unique in 
our approach that we quantify the disaggregating uncertainty using continuous 
pattern correlation instead of binary device activity states. Further, we 
outline using the disaggregated appliance activity data for human activity 
recognition (HAR). To evaluate our approach, we use a dataset collected from 
actual households. We show that the developed NILM approach works, and the 
disaggregation quality depends on the pattern selection and the appliance type. 
In summary, we demonstrate that it is possible to detect human activity within 
the residence using a motif-detection-based NILM approach applied to smart meter 
measurements.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is the most common cancer in children, and its 
diagnosis mainly includes microscopic blood tests of the bone marrow. Therefore, 
there is a need for a correct classification of white blood cells. The approach 
developed in this article is based on an optimized and small IoT-friendly neural 
network architecture. The application of learning transfer in hybrid artificial 
intelligence systems is offered. The hybrid system consisted of a MobileNet v2 
encoder pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset and machine learning algorithms 
performing the role of the head. These were the XGBoost, Random Forest, and 
Decision Tree algorithms. In this work, the average accuracy was over 90%, 
reaching 97.4%. This work proves that using hybrid artificial intelligence 
systems for tasks with a low computational complexity of the processing units 
demonstrates a high classification accuracy. The methods used in this study, 
confirmed by the promising results, can be an effective tool in diagnosing other 
blood diseases, facilitating the work of a network of medical institutions to 
carry out the correct treatment schedule.

Management of Industrial Assets Based on Preferred Reporting Items for 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses.

Surveys on explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) are related to biology, 
clinical trials, fintech management, medicine, neurorobotics, and psychology, 
among others. Prognostics and health management (PHM) is the discipline that 
links the studies of failure mechanisms to system lifecycle management. There is 
a need, which is still absent, to produce an analytical compilation of PHM-XAI 
works. In this paper, we use preferred reporting items for systematic reviews 
and meta-analyses (PRISMA) to present a state of the art on XAI applied to PHM 
of industrial assets. This work provides an overview of the trend of XAI in PHM 
and answers the question of accuracy versus explainability, considering the 
extent of human involvement, explanation assessment, and uncertainty 
quantification in this topic. Research articles associated with the subject, 
since 2015 to 2021, were selected from five databases following the PRISMA 
methodology, several of them related to sensors. The data were extracted from 
selected articles and examined obtaining diverse findings that were synthesized 
as follows. First, while the discipline is still young, the analysis indicates a 
growing acceptance of XAI in PHM. Second, XAI offers dual advantages, where it 
is assimilated as a tool to execute PHM tasks and explain diagnostic and anomaly 
detection activities, implying a real need for XAI in PHM. Third, the review 
shows that PHM-XAI papers provide interesting results, suggesting that the PHM 
performance is unaffected by the XAI. Fourth, human role, evaluation metrics, 
and uncertainty management are areas requiring further attention by the PHM 
community. Adequate assessment metrics to cater to PHM needs are requested. 
Finally, most case studies featured in the considered articles are based on real 
industrial data, and some of them are related to sensors, showing that the 
available PHM-XAI blends solve real-world challenges, increasing the confidence 
in the artificial intelligence models' adoption in the industry.

OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the dynamic and long-term efficacy of vagus 
nerve stimulation (VNS) in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) induced 
by tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). In addition, the impact of VNS on cognition 
and emotion after a one-year follow-up was evaluated.
METHODS: A total of 17 patients diagnosed with DRE induced by TSC were 
retrospectively recruited between 2008 and 2019. Dynamic changes in seizure 
frequency were observed in the responders (≥50% reduction of seizure frequency 
at last follow-up) and non-responders. Clinical characteristics and seizure 
outcomes were comprehensively analyzed to determine factors associated with 
seizure outcomes. The Wechsler intelligence scale was applied in a subgroup of 
six pediatric patients, whereas the Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and 
Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) were assessed in a subgroup of nine patients 
to determine the impact of VNS therapy on cognitive performance and emotional 
state.
RESULTS: The follow-up duration for the 17 patients who underwent VNS treatment 
ranged from 0.5 to 10 years (mean ± SD: 4.1 ± 3.2 years). Monthly seizures 
decreased significantly from three months to four years post-treatment 
(p < 0.05). At the last follow-up, 70.6% of the patients achieved at least a 50% 
reduction in seizure frequency, and three patients were completely seizure free. 
Comparatively, non-responder patients experienced deterioration of seizure 
frequency after the first year. Notably, after one-year follow-up the mean 
standard score of full-scale intelligence quotient increased from 67.33 to 69.5 
(p = 0.078) while the mean, standard score of SDS decreased from 49.22 to 45.67 
(p = 0.003) compared to preoperative neuropsychological evaluation results.
CONCLUSION: VNS is a safe and effective treatment for patients with DRE caused 
by TSC. Although early outcomes were encouraging, a follow-up of at least 
one-year was required to predict long-term outcomes in patients receiving VNS 
treatment. Moreover, VNS may improve depressive mood in patients with DRE caused 
by TSC. Further investigations are needed to validate the present results.

Across species and ages, planning multi-step actions is a hallmark of 
intelligence and critical for survival. Traditionally, researchers adopt a 
"top-down" approach to action planning by focusing on the ability to create an 
internal representation of the world that guides the next step in a multi-step 
action. However, a top-down approach does not inform on underlying mechanisms, 
so researchers can only speculate about how and why improvements in planning 
occur. The current study takes a "bottom-up" approach by testing developmental 
changes in the real-time, moment-to-moment interplay among perceptual, neural, 
and motor components of action planning using simultaneous video, 
motion-tracking, head-mounted eye tracking, and electroencephalography (EEG). 
Preschoolers (n = 32) and adults (n = 22) grasped a hammer with their dominant 
hand to pound a peg when the hammer handle pointed in different directions. When 
the handle pointed toward their non-dominant hand, younger children 
("nonadaptive planners") used a habitual overhand grip that interfered with 
wielding the hammer, whereas adults and older children ("adaptive planners") 
used an adaptive underhand grip. Adaptive and nonadaptive children differed in 
when and where they directed their gaze to obtain visual information, neural 
activation of the motor system before reaching, and straightness of their reach 
trajectories. Nonadaptive children immediately used a habitual overhand grip 
before gathering visual information, leaving insufficient time to form a plan 
before acting. Our novel bottom-up approach transcends mere speculation by 
providing converging evidence that the development of action planning depends on 
a real-time "tug of war" between habits and information gathering and 
processing.

Artificial Intelligence Is Safer for My Privacy: Interplay Between Types of 
Personal Information and Agents on Perceived Privacy Risk and Concerns.

The development of novel technologies has increasingly complicated the issue of 
users' privacy. This study aimed to investigate the impact that the types of 
information as well as agents have on perceptions of privacy risks and concerns. 
The results showed that participants perceived privacy risk and were most 
concerned when they were asked to provide digital life information, followed by 
being asked for digital footprint information, and even more so when they were 
asked to provide this information to a human agent instead of an artificial 
intelligence agent. However, there were no differences in the perception of 
privacy risks and concerns with respect to self-expression and demographic 
information. The implications of these findings are also discussed.

Canarias, Spain.

BACKGROUND: There is a clear predominance of programmes aimed at improving 
aspects related to language production in pupils with developmental language 
disorder (DLD). However, programmes aimed at improving their receptive skills 
are limited.
AIMS: The main aim was to assess the effectiveness of an intervention programme 
for oral language comprehension skills in preschoolers with typical development 
(TD) and pupils with DLD.
METHODS & PROCEDURES: Participants were 99 five-year-old pupils, with and 
without DLD, divided into four groups: two control groups (TD-C = 25; DLD-C = 
25) and two experimental groups (TD-T = 24; DLD-T = 25), from schools on the 
Spanish island of Tenerife. The study used, as pre- and post-measures, the 
receptive language subtests of the CELF-4-Spanish: Concepts and Following 
Directions, Word Classes-Receptive and Sentence Structure, as well as two tasks 
assessing comprehension of paragraphs and narratives. Due to the strong link 
between oral comprehension skills and executive functions, working memory and 
semantic fluency are included in this research. The Backward Digit Span subtest 
of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-IV) and Semantic Fluency 
subtest of the Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT) were used to assess 
working memory and semantic fluency, respectively. The intervention programme 
followed a multitiered system of support (MTSS) model, with 95 sessions lasting 
60 min each delivered jointly by teachers and speech and language therapists, 
and focused on lexical-semantic, morphological, syntactic and narrative skills; 
inferences; verbal working memory; and semantic fluency.
OUTCOMES & RESULTS: The results showed, as expected, that pupils diagnosed with 
DLD initially performed worse on oral language comprehension and executive 
functions than pupils with TD. Further, the DLD-T and TD-T groups showed greater 
gains following the programme, especially in word classes-receptive, sentence 
structure, verbal working memory and semantic fluency. Finally, a significant 
positive correlation was found between the gains obtained by the participants in 
verbal working memory and semantic fluency, with the gains obtained in the three 
CELF-4-Spanish subtests.
CONCLUSIONS & IMPLICATIONS: An intervention programme applied at an early age 
fosters oral language comprehension skills and executive functions in pupils 
with DLD and TD. The intervention organized at different levels of support, 
following an MTSS model, showed clear progress of the DLD and TD groups in oral 
language comprehension and executive functions.
WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Pupils with DLD present deficits in linguistic 
comprehension and executive functions. There are many intervention programs 
focused on improving language production skills. It is also necessary to 
consider the skills underlying language problems in pupils with DLD. Oral 
language, inference, working memory and semantic fluency activities improve 
comprehension. A collaborative and inclusive intervention of teachers and speech 
language therapists. Psycholinguistic and neuropsychological skills training 
should become part of the academic curriculum as early as preschool age. What is 
already known on the subject Pupils with DLD show problems related to both 
comprehension and production language. However, there is a clear predominance of 
programs just aimed at improving aspects related to language production. 
Clinical implications of this study An intervention program applied at an early 
age fosters oral language comprehension skills and executive function in pupils 
with DLD. The intervention organized at different levels of support, following 
an adaptation of the Response Tier Intervention models, showed clear progress of 
the DLD in comprehension oral language and executive functions.

The present study investigated the Danish secular trend of intelligence test 
scores among young men born between 1940 and 2000, as well as the possible 
associations of birth cohort changes in family size, nutrition, education, and 
intelligence test score variability with the increasing secular trend. The study 
population included all men born from 1940 to 2000 who appeared before a draft 
board before 2020 (N = 1,556,770). At the mandatory draft board examination, the 
approximately 19-year-old men underwent a medical examination and an 
intelligence test. In the statistical analyses, the IQ mean and standard 
deviation (SD) were estimated separately for each of the included annual birth 
cohorts based on information from birth cohorts with available total 
intelligence test scores for all tested individuals (i.e. 1940-1958 and 
1987-2000; the mean and SD were interpolated for the intermediate birth 
cohorts). Moreover, the possible associations with birth cohort changes in 
family size, height as a proxy for nutritional status, education, and IQ 
variability were investigated among those birth cohorts for whom a secular 
increase in intelligence test scores was found. The results showed that the 
estimated mean IQ score increased from a baseline set to 100 (SD: 15) among 
individuals born in 1940 to 108.9 (SD: 12.2) among individuals born in 1980, 
since when it has decreased. Focusing on the birth cohorts of 1940-1980, for 
whom a secular increase in intelligence test scores was found, birth cohort 
changes in family size, height, and education explained large proportions of the 
birth cohort variance in mean intelligence test scores, suggesting that these 
factors may be important contributors to the observed Flynn effect in Denmark.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the potential of artificial intelligence in combating 
COVID-19 pandemic.
METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar were searched for 
the term "Artificial intelligence and COVID-19" up to March 31, 2021.
RESULTS: Artificial intelligence (AI) is a potential tool to contain the current 
pandemic. AI can be used in many fields such as early detection and respective 
diagnosis, supervision of treatment, projection of cases and mortality, contact 
tracing of individuals, development of drugs and vaccines, reduces workload on 
health workers, prevention of disease, analysis of mental health of people amid 
pandemic.
CONCLUSIONS: AI is being updated and being improved, second by second to be able 
to interpret like actual human minds. This advancement in AI may lead to a 
completely different future of COVID-19 pandemic where most of the simpler works 
may be done by AI and only essential works could be done by health workers in 
order to increase patient care in current scenario of COVID-19 outbreak. But 
again one of the main constraint is of limited trustworthy and noise free 
sources of information. So the need for the hour is to make a free data system 
where most of the analysed data could be available to feed AI, which could 
effectively halt the current pandemic.

Drug repositioning aims to reuse existing drugs, shelved drugs, or drug 
candidates that failed clinical trials for other medical indications. Its 
attraction is sprung from the reduction in risk associated with safety testing 
of new medications and the time to get a known drug into the clinics. Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) has been recently pursued to speed up drug repositioning and 
discovery. The essence of AI in drug repositioning is to unify the knowledge and 
actions, i.e. incorporating real-world and experimental data to map out the best 
way forward to identify effective therapeutics against a disease. In this 
review, we share positive expectations for the evolution of AI and drug 
repositioning and summarize the role of AI in several methods of drug 
repositioning.

A targeted cancer therapy is only useful if there is a way to accurately 
identify the tumors that are susceptible to that therapy. Thus rapid expansion 
in the number of available targeted cancer treatments has been accompanied by a 
robust effort to subdivide the traditional histological and anatomical tumor 
classifications into molecularly defined subtypes. This review highlights the 
history of the paired evolution of targeted therapies and biomarkers, reviews 
currently used methods for subtype identification, and discusses challenges to 
the implementation of precision oncology as well as possible solutions.

Chemotherapeutic agents have been used for the treatment of numerous cancers, 
but due to poor selectivity and severe systemic side effects, their clinical 
application is limited. Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) or RNA aptamers could 
conjugate with highly toxic chemotherapy drugs, toxins, therapeutic RNAs or 
other molecules as novel aptamer-drug conjugates (ApDCs), which are capable of 
significantly improving the therapeutic efficacy and reducing the systemic 
toxicity of drugs and have great potential in clinics for targeted cancer 
therapy. In this review, we have comprehensively discussed and summarized the 
current advances in the screening approaches of aptamers for specific cancer 
biomarker targeting and development of the aptamer-drug conjugate strategy for 
targeted drug delivery. Moreover, considering the huge progress in artificial 
intelligence (AI) for protein and RNA structure predictions, automatic design of 
aptamers using deep/machine learning techniques could be a powerful approach for 
rapid and precise construction of biopharmaceutics (i.e., ApDCs) for application 
in cancer targeted therapy.

Meat eating is one of the hallmarks of human evolution. It has been linked to 
the beginning of stone tool use, to physiological changes leading to crucial 
anatomical transformations defining our genus, and to new socioreproductive and 
cognitive behaviors. Uncontroversial evidence of meat eating goes back to 2.6 
million years ago; however, little is known about the frequency and timing with 
which early hominins acquired animal resources. Here, we show that the 
combination of hunting and scavenging documented in some modern human foragers 
may have a long evolutionary trajectory. Using a new set of artificial 
intelligence methods for objective identification, we present direct evidence of 
an episode of hominins scavenging from large felids-probably lions-discovered at 
Olduvai Gorge (DS site, Bed I). This casts a new perspective on the diversity of 
hominin carcass acquisition behaviors and survival strategies, and places some 
early Pleistocene hominins in ecological proximity to African large carnivore 
guilds.

As modern science and technology constantly progresses, the fields of artificial 
intelligence, mixed reality technology, remote technology, etc. have rapidly 
developed. Meanwhile, these technologies have been gradually applied to the 
medical field, leading to the development of intelligent medicine. What's more, 
intelligent medicine has greatly promoted the development of traditional Chinese 
medicine (TCM), causing huge changes in the diagnosis of TCM ailments, remote 
treatment, teaching, etc. Therefore, there are both opportunities and challenges 
for inheriting and developing TCM. Herein, the related research progress of 
intelligent medicine in the TCM in China and abroad over the years is analyzed, 
with the purpose of introducing the present application status of intelligent 
medicine in TCM and providing reference for the inheritance and development of 
TCM in a new era.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impacts of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) on white 
matter (WM) integrity and cognitive functions of pediatric patients with 
different levels of OSA severity.
METHODS: Fifty-eight children with OSA and thirty-four healthy controls (HC) 
were recruited. All participants underwent diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) 
examination, polysomnography (PSG), and neurocognitive assessments. Patients 
were divided into mild OSA (MG) and moderate-severe OSA (SG) groups. WM 
integrity, PSG data, and neurocognitive assessment scores were compared among 
those groups.
RESULTS: For apnea hypopnea index (AHI), obstructive apnea hypopnea index 
(OAHI), arousal index, SpO2 nadir, and attention, SG was worse than both MG and 
HC with MG worse than HC. For baseline SpO2 and intelligence, SG was worse than 
both MG and HC with no significant difference between MG and HC. Impaired WM 
integrity was observed in bilateral anterior thalamic radiation, bilateral 
inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, bilateral inferior longitudinal 
fasciculus, right superior longitudinal fasciculus, right hippocampus, left 
cingulate gyrus, right uncinate fasciculus, callosum forceps major, and callosum 
forceps minor only for SG than for HC. WM integrity was significantly correlated 
with OSA severity and neurocognitive assessment scores only for SG, but not for 
MG.
CONCLUSION: Decreased baseline SpO2, WM impairment, and intelligence decline 
were all observed only for SG, but not for MG, implying an associated 
relationship among decreased SpO2, WM impairment and WM impairment. Thus, for 
SG, additional assessments of brain damage and cognitive function decline are 
needed for prognostic evaluation of OSA.

Attitudes, Barriers, and Concerns Regarding Telemedicine Among Swedish Primary 
Care Physicians: A Qualitative Study.

PURPOSE: The primary care physician's traditional patient contacts are 
challenged by the rapidly accelerating digital transformation. In a quantitative 
survey analysis based on the theory of planned behavior, we found high 
behavioral intention to use telemedicine among Swedish primary care physicians, 
but low reported use. The aim of this study was to further examine the 
physicians' experiences regarding telemedicine, with a focus on possible 
explanations for the gap between intention and use, through analysis of the 
free-text comments supplied in the survey.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The material was collected through a web-based survey 
which was sent out to physicians at 160 primary health care centers in southern 
Sweden from May to August 2019. The survey covered four areas: general 
experiences of telemedicine, digital contacts, chronic disease monitoring with 
digital tools, and artificial intelligence. A total of 100 physicians submitted 
one or more free-text comments. These were analyzed using qualitative content 
analysis with an inductive approach.
RESULTS: The primary care physicians expressed attitudes towards telemedicine 
that focused on clinical usefulness. Barriers to use were the loss of personal 
contact with patients and a deficient technological infrastructure. The major 
concerns were that these factors would result in patient harm and an increased 
workload. The connection between intention and use postulated by the theory of 
planned behavior was not applicable in this context, as external factors in the 
form of availability and clinical usefulness of the specific technology were 
major impediments to use despite a generally positive attitude.
CONCLUSION: All telemedicine tools must be evaluated regarding clinical 
usefulness, patient safety, and effects on staff workload, and end users should 
be included in this process. Utmost consideration is needed regarding how to 
retain the benefits of personal contact between patient and provider when 
digital solutions are introduced.

The ubiquity of social media and their deep integration in the contemporary 
society has granted new ways to interact, exchange information, form groups, or 
earn money-all on a scale never seen before. Those possibilities paired with the 
widespread popularity contribute to the level of impact that social media 
display. Unfortunately, the benefits brought by them come at a cost. Social 
Media can be employed by various entities to spread disinformation-so called 
'Fake News', either to make a profit or influence the behaviour of the society. 
To reduce the impact and spread of Fake News, a diverse array of countermeasures 
were devised. These include linguistic-based approaches, which often utilise 
Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning (DL). However, as the latest 
advancements in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) domain show, the model's high 
performance is no longer enough. The explainability of the system's decision is 
equally crucial in real-life scenarios. Therefore, the objective of this paper 
is to present a novel explainability approach in BERT-based fake news detectors. 
This approach does not require extensive changes to the system and can be 
attached as an extension for operating detectors. For this purposes, two 
Explainable Artificial Intelligence (xAI) techniques, Local Interpretable 
Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) and Anchors, will be used and evaluated on 
fake news data, i.e., short pieces of text forming tweets or headlines. This 
focus of this paper is on the explainability approach for fake news detectors, 
as the detectors themselves were part of previous works of the authors.

Machine learning (ML), one aspect of artificial intelligence (AI), involves 
computer algorithms that train themselves. They have been widely applied in the 
healthcare domain. However, many trained ML algorithms operate as 'black boxes', 
producing a prediction from input data without a clear explanation of their 
workings. Non-transparent predictions are of limited utility in many clinical 
domains, where decisions must be justifiable. Here, we apply class-contrastive 
counterfactual reasoning to ML to demonstrate how specific changes in inputs 
lead to different predictions of mortality in people with severe mental illness 
(SMI), a major public health challenge. We produce predictions accompanied by 
visual and textual explanations as to how the prediction would have differed 
given specific changes to the input. We apply it to routinely collected data 
from a mental health secondary care provider in patients with schizophrenia. 
Using a data structuring framework informed by clinical knowledge, we captured 
information on physical health, mental health, and social predisposing factors. 
We then trained an ML algorithm and other statistical learning techniques to 
predict the risk of death. The ML algorithm predicted mortality with an area 
under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.80 (95% confidence 
intervals [0.78, 0.82]). We used class-contrastive analysis to produce 
explanations for the model predictions. We outline the scenarios in which 
class-contrastive analysis is likely to be successful in producing explanations 
for model predictions. Our aim is not to advocate for a particular model but 
show an application of the class-contrastive analysis technique to electronic 
healthcare record data for a disease of public health significance. In patients 
with schizophrenia, our work suggests that use or prescription of medications 
like antidepressants was associated with lower risk of death. Abuse of 
alcohol/drugs and a diagnosis of delirium were associated with higher risk of 
death. Our ML models highlight the role of co-morbidities in determining 
mortality in patients with schizophrenia and the need to manage co-morbidities 
in these patients. We hope that some of these bio-social factors can be targeted 
therapeutically by either patient-level or service-level interventions. Our 
approach combines clinical knowledge, health data, and statistical learning, to 
make predictions interpretable to clinicians using class-contrastive reasoning. 
This is a step towards interpretable AI in the management of patients with 
schizophrenia and potentially other diseases.

Imaging datasets in cancer research are growing exponentially in both quantity 
and information density. These massive datasets may enable derivation of 
insights for cancer research and clinical care, but only if researchers are 
equipped with the tools to leverage advanced computational analysis approaches 
such as machine learning and artificial intelligence. In this work, we highlight 
three themes to guide development of such computational tools: scalability, 
standardization, and ease of use. We then apply these principles to develop 
PathML, a general-purpose research toolkit for computational pathology. We 
describe the design of the PathML framework and demonstrate applications in 
diverse use cases. PathML is publicly available at www.pathml.com.

PURPOSE: The objective of this study is to construct a computer aided diagnosis 
system for normal people and pneumoconiosis using X-raysand deep learning 
algorithms.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 1760 anonymous digital X-ray images of real patients 
between January 2017 and June 2020 were collected for this experiment. In order 
to concentrate the feature extraction ability of the model more on the lung 
region and restrain the influence of external background factors, a two-stage 
pipeline from coarse to fine was established. First, the U-Net model was used to 
extract the lung regions on each sides of the collection images. Second, the 
ResNet-34 model with transfer learning strategy was implemented to learn the 
image features extracted in the lung region to achieve accurate classification 
of pneumoconiosis patients and normal people.
RESULTS: Among the 1760 cases collected, the accuracy and the area under curve 
of the classification model were 92.46% and 89% respectively.
CONCLUSION: The successful application of deep learning in the diagnosis of 
pneumoconiosis further demonstrates the potential of medical artificial 
intelligence and proves the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm. However, 
when we further classified pneumoconiosis patients and normal subjects into four 
categories, we found that the overall accuracy decreased to 70.1%. We will use 
the CT modality in future studies to provide more details of lung regions.

Angiogenesis is a key step in the initiation and progression of an invasive 
breast cancer. High microvessel density by morphological characterization 
predicts metastasis and poor survival in women with invasive breast cancers. 
However, morphologic characterization is subject to variability and only can 
evaluate a limited portion of an invasive breast cancer. Consequently, breast 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is currently being evaluated to assess 
vascularity. Recently, through the new field of radiomics, dynamic contrast 
enhanced (DCE)-MRI is being used to evaluate vascular density, vascular 
morphology, and detection of aggressive breast cancer biology. While DCE-MRI is 
a highly sensitive tool, there are specific features that limit computational 
evaluation of blood vessels. These include (1) DCE-MRI evaluates gadolinium 
contrast and does not directly evaluate biology, (2) the resolution of DCE-MRI 
is insufficient for imaging small blood vessels, and (3) DCE-MRI images are very 
difficult to co-register. Here we review computational approaches for detection 
and analysis of blood vessels in DCE-MRI images and present some of the 
strategies we have developed for co-registry of DCE-MRI images and early 
detection of vascularization.

»: Suspected scaphoid fractures are a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge 
despite the advances in knowledge regarding these injuries and imaging 
techniques. The risks and restrictions of routine immobilization as well as the 
restriction of activities in a young and active population must be weighed 
against the risks of nonunion that are associated with a missed fracture.
»: The prevalence of true fractures among suspected fractures is low. This 
greatly reduces the statistical probability that a positive diagnostic test will 
correspond with a true fracture, reducing the positive predictive value of an 
investigation.
»: There is no consensus reference standard for a true fracture; therefore, 
alternative statistical methods for calculating sensitivity, specificity, and 
positive and negative predictive values are required.
»: Clinical prediction rules that incorporate a set of demographic and clinical 
factors may allow stratification of secondary imaging, which, in turn, could 
increase the pretest probability of a scaphoid fracture and improve the 
diagnostic performance of the sophisticated radiographic investigations that are 
available.
»: Machine-learning-derived probability calculators may augment risk 
stratification and can improve through retraining, although these theoretical 
benefits need further prospective evaluation.
»: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a form of artificial intelligence 
that have demonstrated great promise in the recognition of scaphoid fractures on 
radiographs. However, in the more challenging diagnostic scenario of a suspected 
or so-called "clinical" scaphoid fracture, CNNs have not yet proven superior to 
a diagnosis that has been made by an experienced surgeon.

Use of prostate MRI has increased greatly in the past decade, primarily in 
directing targeted prostate biopsy. However, prostate MRI interpretation remains 
prone to interreader variation. Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential 
to standardize detection of lesions on MRI that are suspicious for prostate 
cancer (PCa). The purpose of this review is to explore the current status of AI 
for the automated detection of PCa on MRI. Recent literature describing 
promising results regarding AI models for PCa detection on MRI is highlighted. 
Numerous limitations of the existing literature are also described, including 
biases in model validation, heterogeneity in reporting of performance metrics, 
and lack of sufficient evidence of clinical translation. Challenges related to 
AI ethics and data governance are also discussed. An outlook is provided for AI 
in lesion detection on prostate MRI in the coming years, emphasizing current 
research needs. Future investigations, incorporating large-scale diverse 
multiinstitutional training and testing datasets, are anticipated to enable the 
development of more robust AI models for PCa detection on MRI, though 
prospective clinical trials will ultimately be required to establish benefit of 
AI in patient management.

Cancer victims, particularly those with lung cancer, are more susceptible and at 
higher danger of COVID-19 and associated consequences as a result of their 
compromised immune systems, which makes them particularly sensitive. Because of 
a variety of circumstances, cancer patients' diagnosis, treatment, and aftercare 
are very complicated and time-consuming during an epidemic. In such 
circumstances, advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning 
algorithms (ML) offer the capacity to boost cancer sufferer diagnosis, therapy, 
and care via the use of cutting technologies. For example, using clinical and 
imaging data combined with machine learning methods, the researchers may be able 
to distinguish among lung alterations induced by corona virus and those produced 
by immunotherapy and radiation. During this epidemic, artificial intelligence 
(AI) may be utilized to guarantee that the appropriate individuals are recruited 
in cancer clinical trials more quickly and effectively than in the past, which 
was done in a conventional and complicated manner. In order to better care for 
cancer patients and find novel and more effective therapies, It is critical that 
we move beyond traditional research methods and use artificial intelligence (AI) 
and machine learning to update our research (ML). Artificial intelligence (AI) 
and machine learning (ML) are being utilised to help with several aspects of the 
COVID-19 epidemic, such as epidemiology, molecular research and medication 
development, medical diagnosis and treatment, and socioeconomics. The use of 
artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in the diagnosis and 
treatment of COVID-19 patients is also being investigated. The combination of 
artificial intelligence and machine learning in COVID-19 may help to identify 
positive patients more quickly. In order to understand the dynamics of an 
epidemic that is relevant to artificial intelligence, when used in different 
patient groups, AI-based algorithms can quickly detect CT scans with COVID-19 
linked pneumonia, as well as discriminate non-COVID connected pneumonia with 
high specificity and accuracy. It is possible to utilize the existing 
difficulties and future views presented in this study to guide an optimal 
implementation of AI and machine learning technologies in an epidemic.

The aim of the study is to develop artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm based 
on a deep learning model to predict mortality using abbreviate injury score 
(AIS). The performance of the conventional anatomic injury severity score (ISS) 
system in predicting in-hospital mortality is still limited. AIS data of 42,933 
patients registered in the Korean trauma data bank from four Korean regional 
trauma centers were enrolled. After excluding patients who were younger than 
19 years old and those who died within six hours from arrival, we included 
37,762 patients, of which 36,493 (96.6%) survived and 1269 (3.4%) deceased. To 
enhance the AI model performance, we reduced the AIS codes to 46 input values by 
organizing them according to the organ location (Region-46). The total AIS and 
six categories of the anatomic region in the ISS system (Region-6) were used to 
compare the input features. The AI models were compared with the conventional 
ISS and new ISS (NISS) systems. We evaluated the performance pertaining to the 
12 combinations of the features and models. The highest accuracy (85.05%) 
corresponded to Region-46 with DNN, followed by that of Region-6 with DNN 
(83.62%), AIS with DNN (81.27%), ISS-16 (80.50%), NISS-16 (79.18%), NISS-25 
(77.09%), and ISS-25 (70.82%). The highest AUROC (0.9084) corresponded to 
Region-46 with DNN, followed by that of Region-6 with DNN (0.9013), AIS with DNN 
(0.8819), ISS (0.8709), and NISS (0.8681). The proposed deep learning scheme 
with feature combination exhibited high accuracy metrics such as the balanced 
accuracy and AUROC than the conventional ISS and NISS systems. We expect that 
our trial would be a cornerstone of more complex combination model.

Re-Modelling 99m-Technetium Pertechnetate Thyroid Uptake; Statistical, Machine 
Learning and Deep Learning Approaches.

Background: While normal ranges for 99mTc thyroid percentage uptake vary, the 
seemingly intuitive evaluation of thyroid function does not reflect the 
complexity of thyroid pathology and biochemical status. The emergence of 
artificial intelligence (AI) in nuclear medicine has driven problem solving 
associated with logic and reasoning that warrant re-examination of established 
benchmarks in thyroid functional assessment. Methods: There were 123 patients 
retrospectively analysed in the study sample comparing scintigraphic findings to 
grounded truth established through biochemistry status. Conventional statistical 
approaches were used in conjunction with an artificial neural network (ANN) to 
determine predictors of thyroid function from data features. A convolutional 
neural network (CNN) was also used to extract features from the input tensor 
(images). Results: Analysis was confounded by sub-clinical hyperthyroidism, 
primary hypothyroidism, sub-clinical hypothyroidism and T3 toxicosis. Binary 
accuracy for identifying hyperthyroidism was highest for thyroid uptake 
classification using a threshold of 4.5% (82.6%), followed by pooled physician 
6interpretation with the aid of uptake values (82.3%). Visual evaluation without 
quantitative values reduced accuracy to 61.0% for pooled physician 
determinations and 61.4% classifying on the basis of thyroid gland intensity 
relative to salivary glands. The machine learning (ML) algorithm produced 84.6% 
accuracy, however, this included biochemistry features not available to the 
semantic analysis. The deep learning (DL) algorithm had an accuracy of 80.5% 
based on image inputs alone. Conclusion: Thyroid scintigraphy is useful in 
identifying hyperthyroid patients suitable for radioiodine therapy when using an 
appropriately validated cut-off for the patient population (4.5% in this 
population). ML ANN algorithms can be developed to improve accuracy as second 
readers systems when biochemistry results are available. DL CNN algorithms can 
be developed to improve accuracy in the absence of biochemistry results. ML and 
DL do not displace the role of the physician in thyroid scintigraphy but could 
be used as second reader systems to minimize errors and increase confidence.

BACKGROUND: Although deep neural networks (DNNs) are showing state of the art 
performance in clinical gait analysis, they are considered to be black-box 
algorithms. In other words, there is a lack of direct understanding of a DNN's 
ability to identify relevant features, hindering clinical acceptance. 
Interpretability methods have been developed to ameliorate this concern by 
providing a way to explain DNN predictions.
METHODS: This paper proposes the use of an interpretability method to explain 
DNN decisions for classifying the movement that precedes freezing of gait (FOG), 
one of the most debilitating symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). The proposed 
two-stage pipeline consists of (1) a convolutional neural network (CNN) to model 
the reduction of movement present before a FOG episode, and (2) layer-wise 
relevance propagation (LRP) to visualize the underlying features that the CNN 
perceives as important to model the pathology. The CNN was trained with the 
sagittal plane kinematics from a motion capture dataset of fourteen PD patients 
with FOG. The robustness of the model predictions and learned features was 
further assessed on fourteen PD patients without FOG and fourteen age-matched 
healthy controls.
RESULTS: The CNN proved highly accurate in modelling the movement that precedes 
FOG, with 86.8% of the strides being correctly identified. However, the CNN 
model was unable to model the movement for one of the seven patients that froze 
during the protocol. The LRP interpretability case study shows that (1) the 
kinematic features perceived as most relevant by the CNN are the reduced peak 
knee flexion and the fixed ankle dorsiflexion during the swing phase, (2) very 
little relevance for FOG is observed in the PD patients without FOG and the 
healthy control subjects, and (3) the poor predictive performance of one subject 
is attributed to the patient's unique and severely flexed gait signature.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed pipeline can aid clinicians in explaining DNN 
decisions in clinical gait analysis and aid machine learning practitioners in 
assessing the generalization of their models by ensuring that the predictions 
are based on meaningful kinematic features.

BACKGROUND: The inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) innervates and regulates the 
sensation of the mandibular teeth and lower lip. The position of the IAN should 
be monitored prior to surgery. Therefore, a study using artificial intelligence 
(AI) was planned to image and track the position of the IAN automatically for a 
quicker and safer surgery.
METHODS: A total of 138 cone-beam computed tomography datasets (Internal: 98, 
External: 40) collected from multiple centers (three hospitals) were used in the 
study. A customized 3D nnU-Net was used for image segmentation. Active learning, 
which consists of three steps, was carried out in iterations for 83 datasets 
with cumulative additions after each step. Subsequently, the accuracy of the 
model for IAN segmentation was evaluated using the 50 datasets. The accuracy by 
deriving the dice similarity coefficient (DSC) value and the segmentation time 
for each learning step were compared. In addition, visual scoring was considered 
to comparatively evaluate the manual and automatic segmentation.
RESULTS: After learning, the DSC gradually increased to 0.48 ± 0.11 to 
0.50 ± 0.11, and 0.58 ± 0.08. The DSC for the external dataset was 0.49 ± 0.12. 
The times required for segmentation were 124.8, 143.4, and 86.4 s, showing a 
large decrease at the final stage. In visual scoring, the accuracy of manual 
segmentation was found to be higher than that of automatic segmentation.
CONCLUSIONS: The deep active learning framework can serve as a fast, accurate, 
and robust clinical tool for demarcating IAN location.

BACKGROUND: Diagnosis of pneumonia is critical in managing patients with febrile 
neutropenia (FN), however, chest X-ray (CXR) has limited performance in the 
detection of pneumonia. We aimed to evaluate the performance of a deep 
learning-based computer-aided detection (CAD) system in pneumonia detection in 
the CXRs of consecutive FN patients and investigated whether CAD could improve 
radiologists' diagnostic performance when used as a second reader.
METHODS: CXRs of patients with FN (a body temperature ≥ 38.3 °C, or a sustained 
body temperature ≥ 38.0 °C for an hour; absolute neutrophil count < 500/mm3) 
obtained between January and December 2017 were consecutively included, from a 
single tertiary referral hospital. Reference standards for the diagnosis of 
pneumonia were defined by consensus of two thoracic radiologists after reviewing 
medical records and CXRs. A commercialized, deep learning-based CAD system was 
retrospectively applied to detect pulmonary infiltrates on CXRs. For comparing 
performance, five radiologists independently interpreted CXRs initially without 
the CAD results (radiologist-alone interpretation), followed by the 
interpretation with CAD. The sensitivities and specificities for detection of 
pneumonia were compared between radiologist-alone interpretation and 
interpretation with CAD. The standalone performance of the CAD was also 
evaluated, using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), 
sensitivity, and specificity. Moreover, sensitivity and specificity of 
standalone CAD were compared with those of radiologist-alone interpretation.
RESULTS: Among 525 CXRs from 413 patients (52.3% men; median age 59 years), 
pneumonia was diagnosed in 128 (24.4%) CXRs. In the interpretation with CAD, 
average sensitivity of radiologists was significantly improved (75.4% to 79.4%, 
P = 0.003) while their specificity remained similar (75.4% to 76.8%, P = 0.101), 
compared to radiologist-alone interpretation. The CAD exhibited AUC, 
sensitivity, and specificity of 0.895, 88.3%, and 68.3%, respectively. The 
standalone CAD exhibited higher sensitivity (86.6% vs. 75.2%, P < 0.001) and 
lower specificity (64.8% vs. 75.4%, P < 0.001) compared to radiologist-alone 
interpretation.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with FN, the deep learning-based CAD system exhibited 
radiologist-level performance in detecting pneumonia on CXRs and enhanced 
radiologists' performance.

BACKGROUND: Software for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometers offer 
general functionality of instrument control and data processing; these 
applications are often developed with non-scripting languages. NMR users need to 
flexibly integrate rapidly developing NMR applications with emerging 
technologies. Scripting systems offer open environments for NMR users to write 
custom programs. However, existing scripting systems have limited capabilities 
for both extending the functionality of NMR software's non-script main program 
and using advanced native script libraries to support specialized application 
domains (e.g., biomacromolecules and metabolomics). Therefore, it is essential 
to design a novel scripting system to address both of these needs.
RESULT: Here, a novel NMR scripting system named SpinSPJ is proposed. It works 
as a plug-in in the Java based NMR spectrometer software SpinStudioJ. In the 
scripting system, both Java based NMR methods and original CPython based 
libraries are supported. A module has been developed as a bridge to integrate 
the runtime environments of Java and CPython. The module works as an extension 
in the CPython environment and interacts with Java via the Java Native 
Interface. Leveraging this bridge, Java based instrument control and data 
processing methods of SpinStudioJ can be called with the CPython style. Compared 
with traditional scripting systems, SpinSPJ better supports both extending the 
non-script main program and implementing advanced NMR applications with a rich 
variety of script libraries. NMR researchers can easily call functions of 
instrument control and data processing as well as developing complex 
functionality (such as multivariate statistical analysis, deep learning, etc.) 
with CPython native libraries.
CONCLUSION: SpinSPJ offers a user-friendly environment to implement custom 
functionality leveraging its powerful basic NMR and rich CPython libraries. NMR 
applications with emerging technologies can be easily integrated. The scripting 
system is free of charge and can be downloaded by visiting

Task-domain and hemisphere-asymmetry effects in cisgender and transmale 
individuals.

Burgund ED(1).

Author information:
(1)Department of Psychology, Macalester College, Saint Paul, Minnesota, United 
States of America.

The present research examined the extent to which transmale individuals' 
functional brain organization resembles that of their assigned sex or gender 
identity. Cisgender-female, cisgender-male, and transmale participants, who were 
assigned female sex but did not have a female gender identity, were compared in 
terms of effects that have been observed in cisgender individuals: task-domain 
effects, in which males perform better than females on spatial tasks and females 
perform better than males on verbal tasks; and hemisphere-asymmetry effects, in 
which males show larger differences between the left and right hemispheres than 
females. In addition, the present research measured participants' intelligence 
in order to control for potential moderating effects. Participants performed 
spatial (mental rotation) and verbal (lexical decision) tasks presented to each 
hemisphere using a divided-visual field paradigm, and then completed an 
intelligence assessment. In the mental-rotation task, cismale and transmale 
participants performed better than cisfemale participants, however this group 
difference was explained by intelligence scores, with higher scores predicting 
better performance. In the lexical-decision task, cismale and transmale 
participants exhibited a greater left-hemisphere advantage than cisfemales, and 
this difference was not affected by intelligence scores. Taken together, results 
do not support task-domain effects when intelligence is accounted for; however, 
they do demonstrate a hemisphere-asymmetry effect in the verbal domain that is 
moderated by gender identity and not assigned sex.

BACKGROUND: The identification of an appropriate rhythm management strategy for 
patients diagnosed with atrial fibrillation (AF) remains a major challenge for 
providers. Although clinical trials have identified subgroups of patients in 
whom a rate- or rhythm-control strategy might be indicated to improve outcomes, 
the wide range of presentations and risk factors among patients presenting with 
AF makes such approaches challenging. The strength of electronic health records 
is the ability to build in logic to guide management decisions, such that the 
system can automatically identify patients in whom a rhythm-control strategy is 
more likely and can promote efficient referrals to specialists. However, like 
any clinical decision support tool, there is a balance between interpretability 
and accurate prediction.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to create an electronic health record-based 
prediction tool to guide patient referral to specialists for rhythm-control 
management by comparing different machine learning algorithms.
METHODS: We compared machine learning models of increasing complexity and used 
up to 50,845 variables to predict the rhythm-control strategy in 42,022 patients 
within the University of Colorado Health system at the time of AF diagnosis. 
Models were evaluated on the basis of their classification accuracy, defined by 
the F1 score and other metrics, and interpretability, captured by inspection of 
the relative importance of each predictor.
RESULTS: We found that age was by far the strongest single predictor of a 
rhythm-control strategy but that greater accuracy could be achieved with more 
complex models incorporating neural networks and more predictors for each 
participant. We determined that the impact of better prediction models was 
notable primarily in the rate of inappropriate referrals for rhythm-control, in 
which more complex models provided an average of 20% fewer inappropriate 
referrals than simpler, more interpretable models.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that any health care system seeking to incorporate 
algorithms to guide rhythm management for patients with AF will need to address 
this trade-off between prediction accuracy and model interpretability.

BACKGROUND: Cancer survivors often experience disorders from the depressive 
spectrum that remain largely unrecognized and overlooked. Even though screening 
for depression is recognized as essential, several barriers prevent its 
successful implementation. It is possible that better screening options can be 
developed. New possibilities have been opening up with advances in artificial 
intelligence and increasing knowledge on the connection of observable cues and 
psychological states.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this scoping meta-review was to identify observable 
features of depression that can be intercepted using artificial intelligence in 
order to provide a stepping stone toward better recognition of depression among 
cancer survivors.
METHODS: We followed a methodological framework for scoping reviews. We searched 
SCOPUS and Web of Science for relevant papers on the topic, and data were 
extracted from the papers that met inclusion criteria. We used thematic analysis 
within 3 predefined categories of depression cues (ie, language, speech, and 
facial expression cues) to analyze the papers.
RESULTS: The search yielded 1023 papers, of which 9 met the inclusion criteria. 
Analysis of their findings resulted in several well-supported cues of depression 
in language, speech, and facial expression domains, which provides a 
comprehensive list of observable features that are potentially suited to be 
intercepted by artificial intelligence for early detection of depression.
CONCLUSIONS: This review provides a synthesis of behavioral features of 
depression while translating this knowledge into the context of artificial 
intelligence-supported screening for depression in cancer survivors.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a new technical discipline that uses computer 
technology to research and develop the theory, method, technique, and 
application system for the simulation, extension, and expansion of human 
intelligence. With the assistance of new AI technology, the traditional medical 
environment has changed a lot. For example, a patient's diagnosis based on 
radiological, pathological, endoscopic, ultrasonographic, and biochemical 
examinations has been effectively promoted with a higher accuracy and a lower 
human workload. The medical treatments during the perioperative period, 
including the preoperative preparation, surgical period, and postoperative 
recovery period, have been significantly enhanced with better surgical effects. 
In addition, AI technology has also played a crucial role in medical drug 
production, medical management, and medical education, taking them into a new 
direction. The purpose of this review is to introduce the application of AI in 
medicine and to provide an outlook of future trends.

The rapid growth and decreasing cost of Next-generation sequencing (NGS) 
technologies have made it possible to conduct routine large panel genomic 
sequencing in many disease settings, especially in the oncology domain. 
Furthermore, it is now known that optimal disease management of patients depends 
on individualized cancer treatment guided by comprehensive molecular testing. 
However, translating results from molecular sequencing reports into actionable 
clinical insights remains a challenge to most clinicians. In this review, we 
discuss about some representative systems that leverage artificial intelligence 
(AI) to facilitate some processes of clinicians' decision making based upon 
molecular data, focusing on their application in precision oncology. Some 
limitations and pitfalls of the current application of AI in clinical decision 
making are also discussed.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the time lag between onset and 
treatment (treatment delay) for alcohol use disorders (AUD) and associations 
between demographic factors and treatment delay for AUD.
METHODS: The study included 6,584 men registered in the Copenhagen Alcohol 
Cohort, containing information on civil status, employment status, estimated age 
at onset of alcohol problems, and age at first outpatient AUD treatment. Data on 
year of birth, intelligence, and educational level were obtained from the Danish 
Conscription Database. Information on first hospital AUD treatment was retrieved 
from Danish national psychiatric registers. Associations between the demographic 
factors and treatment delay were analysed in separate linear regression models 
adjusted for year of birth and in a mutually adjusted model including all 
demographic factors.
RESULTS: The mean treatment delay for AUD was 6.9 years (SD = 4.1). After mutual 
adjustment, an SD increase in intelligence score was associated with 0.17 years 
increase in treatment delay. Educational level was unrelated to treatment delay. 
Men with estimated age at onset of alcohol problems at age 20 years or younger 
had a 5.30 years longer treatment delay than men who had estimated age at onset 
of alcohol problems at age 51 years or older. Employed men had shorter treatment 
delays than unemployed men, especially among the oldest birth cohorts.
CONCLUSIONS: The treatment delay of 6.9 years highlights the necessity to 
promote access to AUD treatment, perhaps in particular among adolescents and 
young individuals. Cognitive factors may affect treatment delay more than 
non-cognitive personal factors.

Background Objective markers of cardiac function are limited in the outpatient 
setting and may be beneficial for monitoring patients with chronic cardiac 
conditions. We assess the accuracy of a scale, with the ability to capture 
ballistocardiography, electrocardiography, and impedance plethysmography signals 
from a patient's feet while standing on the scale, in measuring stroke volume 
and cardiac output compared with the gold-standard direct Fick method. Methods 
and Results Thirty-two patients with unexplained dyspnea undergoing level 3 
invasive cardiopulmonary exercise test at a tertiary medical center were 
included in the final analysis. We obtained scale and direct Fick measurements 
of stroke volume and cardiac output before and immediately after invasive 
cardiopulmonary exercise test. Stroke volume and cardiac output from a cardiac 
scale and the direct Fick method correlated with r=0.81 and r=0.85, respectively 
(P<0.001 each). The mean absolute error of the scale estimated stroke volume was 
-1.58 mL, with a 95% limits of agreement of -21.97 to 18.81 mL. The mean error 
for the scale estimated cardiac output was -0.31 L/min, with a 95% limits of 
agreement of -2.62 to 2.00 L/min. The changes in stroke volume and cardiac 
output before and after exercise were 78.9% and 96.7% concordant, respectively, 
between the 2 measuring methods. Conclusions In a proof-of-concept study, this 
novel scale with cardiac monitoring abilities may allow for noninvasive, 
longitudinal measures of cardiac function. Using the widely accepted form factor 
of a bathroom scale, this method of monitoring can be easily integrated into a 
patient's lifestyle.

The latest severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variant 
Omicron (B.1.1.529) has ushered panic responses around the world due to its 
contagious and vaccine escape mutations. The essential infectivity and antibody 
resistance of the SARS-CoV-2 variant are determined by its mutations on the 
spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD). However, a complete 
experimental evaluation of Omicron might take weeks or even months. Here, we 
present a comprehensive quantitative analysis of Omicron's infectivity, 
vaccine-breakthrough, and antibody resistance. An artificial intelligence (AI) 
model, which has been trained with tens of thousands of experimental data points 
and extensively validated by experimental data on SARS-CoV-2, reveals that 
Omicron may be over ten times more contagious than the original virus or about 
twice as infectious as the Delta variant. Based on 132 three-dimensional (3D) 
structures of antibody-RBD complexes, we unveil that Omicron may be twice more 
likely to escape current vaccines than the Delta variant. The Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA)-approved monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from Eli Lilly may be 
seriously compromised. Omicron may also diminish the efficacy of mAbs from 
Celltrion and Rockefeller University. However, its impact on Regeneron mAb 
cocktail appears to be mild.

The concept of healing in medicine has been taking a new form where scientists 
and researchers are in pursuance of regenerative medicine. Until now, doctors 
have "reacted" to disease by treating the symptoms; however, modern medicine is 
transforming toward regeneration rather than reactive treatment, which is where 
stem cell therapy comes into the play-the concept of replacing damaged cells 
with brand new cells that perform the same function better. Stem cell treatment 
is currently being used to treat autoimmune, inflammatory, neurological, 
orthopedic, and traumatic disorders, with various research being undertaken for 
a wide range of diseases. It could also be the answer to anti-aging and a 
disease-free state. Despite the benefits, numerous errors could prevail in 
treating patients with stem cells. With the advancement of technology and 
research in the modern period, medicine is beginning to turn to artificial 
intelligence (AI) to address the complicated errors that could occur in 
regenerative medicine. For successful treatment, one must achieve precision and 
accuracy when analyzing healthy and productive stem cells that possess all the 
properties of a native cell. This review intends to discuss and study the 
application of AI in stem cell therapy and how it influences how medicine is 
practiced, thus creating a path to a regenerative future with negligible adverse 
effects. The following databases were used for a literature search: PubMed, 
Google Scholar, PubMed Central, and Institute of Electrical and Electronics 
Engineers (IEEE) Xplore. After a thorough analysis, studies were chosen, keeping 
in mind the inclusion and exclusion criteria set by the authors of this review, 
which comprised reports published within the last six years in the English 
language. The authors also made sure to include studies that sufficed the 
quality of each report assessed using appropriate quality appraisal tools, after 
which eight reports were found to be eligible and were included in this review. 
This research mainly revolves around machine learning, deep neural networks 
(DNN), and other subclasses of AI encompassed in these categories. While there 
are concerns and limitations in implementing various mediums of AI in stem cell 
therapy, the analysis of the eligible studies concluded that artificial 
intelligence provides significant benefits to the global healthcare ecosystem in 
numerous ways, such as determining the viability, functionality, biosafety, and 
bioefficacy of stem cells, as well as appropriate patient selection. Applying AI 
to this novelty brings out the precision, accuracy, and a revolution in 
regenerative medicine. In addition, stem cell therapy is not currently FDA 
approved (except for the blood-forming stem cells) and, to date, is considered 
experimental with no clear outline of risks and benefits. Given this limitation, 
studies are conducted regularly around the world in hopes for a concrete 
conclusion where technological advances such as AI could help in shaping the 
future of regenerative medicine.

Global policymakers and catastrophic risk.

There is a rapidly developing literature on risks that threaten the whole of 
humanity, or a large part of it. Discussion is increasingly turning to how such 
risks can be governed. This paper arises from a study of those involved the 
governance of risks from emerging technologies, examining the perceptions of 
global catastrophic risk within the relevant global policymaking community. 
Those who took part were either civil servants working for the UK government, 
U.S. Congress, the United Nations, and the European Commission, or cognate 
members of civil society groups and the private sector. Analysis of interviews 
identified four major themes: Scepticism; Realism; Influence; and Governance 
outside of Government. These themes provide evidence for the value of 
conceptualising the governance of global catastrophic risk as a unified 
challenge. Furthermore, they highlight the range of agents involved in 
governance of emerging technology and give reason to value reforms carried out 
sub-nationally.

INTRODUCTION: Increasing demand for mental health services and the expanding 
capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) in recent years has driven the 
development of digital mental health interventions (DMHIs). To date, AI-based 
chatbots have been integrated into DMHIs to support diagnostics and screening, 
symptom management and behavior change, and content delivery.
AREAS COVERED: We summarize the current landscape of DMHIs, with a focus on 
AI-based chatbots. Happify Health's AI chatbot, Anna, serves as a case study for 
discussion of potential challenges and how these might be addressed, and 
demonstrates the promise of chatbots as effective, usable, and adoptable within 
DMHIs. Finally, we discuss ways in which future research can advance the field, 
addressing topics including perceptions of AI, the impact of individual 
differences, and implications for privacy and ethics.
EXPERT OPINION: Our discussion concludes with a speculative viewpoint on the 
future of AI in DMHIs, including the use of chatbots, the evolution of AI, 
dynamic mental health systems, hyper-personalization, and human-like 
intervention delivery.

AIMS: We aimed to develop models to detect aortic stenosis (AS) from chest 
radiographs-one of the most basic imaging tests-with artificial intelligence.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We used 10 433 retrospectively collected digital chest 
radiographs from 5638 patients to train, validate, and test three deep learning 
models. Chest radiographs were collected from patients who had also undergone 
echocardiography at a single institution between July 2016 and May 2019. These 
were labelled from the corresponding echocardiography assessments as AS-positive 
or AS-negative. The radiographs were separated on a patient basis into training 
[8327 images from 4512 patients, mean age 65 ±  (standard deviation) 15 years], 
validation (1041 images from 563 patients, mean age 65 ± 14 years), and test 
(1065 images from 563 patients, mean age 65 ± 14 years) datasets. The soft 
voting-based ensemble of the three developed models had the best overall 
performance for predicting AS with an area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive 
value, and negative predictive value of 0.83 (95% confidence interval 
0.77-0.88), 0.78 (0.67-0.86), 0.71 (0.68-0.73), 0.71 (0.68-0.74), 0.18 
(0.14-0.23), and 0.97 (0.96-0.98), respectively, in the validation dataset and 
0.83 (0.78-0.88), 0.83 (0.74-0.90), 0.69 (0.66-0.72), 0.71 (0.68-0.73), 0.23 
(0.19-0.28), and 0.97 (0.96-0.98), respectively, in the test dataset.
CONCLUSION: Deep learning models using chest radiographs have the potential to 
differentiate between radiographs of patients with and without AS.
LAY SUMMARY: We created artificial intelligence (AI) models using deep learning 
to identify aortic stenosis (AS) from chest radiographs. Three AI models were 
developed and evaluated with 10 433 retrospectively collected radiographs and 
labelled from echocardiography reports. The ensemble AI model could detect AS in 
a test dataset with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 
0.83 (95% confidence interval 0.78-0.88). Since chest radiography is a 
cost-effective and widely available imaging test, our model can provide an 
additive resource for the detection of AS.

BACKGROUND : The European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) has 
developed a core curriculum for high quality optical diagnosis training for 
practice across Europe. The development of easy-to-measure competence standards 
for optical diagnosis can optimize clinical decision-making in endoscopy. This 
manuscript represents an official Position Statement of the ESGE aiming to 
define simple, safe, and easy-to-measure competence standards for endoscopists 
and artificial intelligence systems performing optical diagnosis of diminutive 
colorectal polyps (1 - 5 mm). METHODS : A panel of European experts in optical 
diagnosis participated in a modified Delphi process to reach consensus on Simple 
Optical Diagnosis Accuracy (SODA) competence standards for implementation of the 
optical diagnosis strategy for diminutive colorectal polyps. In order to assess 
the clinical benefits and harms of implementing optical diagnosis with different 
competence standards, a systematic literature search was performed. This was 
complemented with the results from a recently performed simulation study that 
provides guidance for setting alternative competence standards for optical 
diagnosis. Proposed competence standards were based on literature search and 
simulation study results. Competence standards were accepted if at least 80 % 
agreement was reached after a maximum of three voting rounds. RECOMMENDATION 1: 
 In order to implement the leave-in-situ strategy for diminutive colorectal 
lesions (1-5 mm), it is clinically acceptable if, during real-time colonoscopy, 
at least 90 % sensitivity and 80 % specificity is achieved for high confidence 
endoscopic characterization of colorectal neoplasia of 1-5 mm in the 
rectosigmoid. Histopathology is used as the gold standard.Level of agreement 
95 %. RECOMMENDATION 2:  In order to implement the resect-and-discard strategy 
for diminutive colorectal lesions (1-5 mm), it is clinically acceptable if, 
during real-time colonoscopy, at least 80 % sensitivity and 80 % specificity is 
achieved for high confidence endoscopic characterization of colorectal neoplasia 
of 1-5 mm. Histopathology is used as the gold standard.Level of agreement 100 %. 
CONCLUSION : The developed SODA competence standards define diagnostic 
performance thresholds in relation to clinical consequences, for training and 
for use when auditing the optical diagnosis of diminutive colorectal polyps.

AI ethics in computational psychiatry: From the neuroscience of consciousness to 
the ethics of consciousness.

Methods used in artificial intelligence (AI) overlap with methods used in 
computational psychiatry (CP). Hence, considerations from AI ethics are also 
relevant to ethical discussions of CP. Ethical issues include, among others, 
fairness and data ownership and protection. Apart from this, morally relevant 
issues also include potential transformative effects of applications of AI-for 
instance, with respect to how we conceive of autonomy and privacy. Similarly, 
successful applications of CP may have transformative effects on how we 
categorise and classify mental disorders and mental health. Since many mental 
disorders go along with disturbed conscious experiences, it is desirable that 
successful applications of CP improve our understanding of disorders involving 
disruptions in conscious experience. Here, we discuss prospects and pitfalls of 
transformative effects that CP may have on our understanding of mental 
disorders. In particular, we examine the concern that even successful 
applications of CP may fail to take all aspects of disordered conscious 
experiences into account.

Among the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) has 
been considered more relevant than other species when estimating the potential 
exposure-related health effects and has been recognized as a marker of 
carcinogenic potency of air pollutant mixture. The current understanding of the 
factors which govern non-linear behavior of B[a]P and associated pollutants and 
environmental processes is insufficient and further research has to rely on the 
advanced analytical approach which averts the assumptions and avoids 
simplifications required by linear modeling methods. For the purpose of this 
study, we employed eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), SHapley Additive 
exPlanations (SHAP) attribution method, and SHAP value fuzzy clustering to 
investigate the concentrations of inorganic gaseous pollutants, radon, PM2.5 and 
particle constituents including trace metals, ions, 16 US EPA priority 
PM2.5-bound PAHs and 31 meteorological variables, as key factors which shape 
indoor and outdoor PM2.5-bound B[a]P distribution in a university building 
located in the urban area of Belgrade (Serbia). According to the results, the 
indoor and outdoor B[a]P levels were shown to be highly correlated and mostly 
influenced by the concentrations of Chry, B[b]F, CO, B[a]A, I[cd]P, B[k]F, Flt, 
D[ah]A, Pyr, B[ghi]P, Cr, As, and PM2.5 in both indoor and outdoor environments. 
Besides, high B[a]P concentration events were recorded during the periods of low 
ambient temperature (<12 °C), unstable weather conditions with precipitation and 
increased soil humidity.

BACKGROUND: Left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) in Chagas disease (ChD) 
is relatively common and its treatment using low-cost drugs can improve symptoms 
and reduce mortality. Recently, an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled ECG 
algorithm showed excellent accuracy to detect LVSD in a general population, but 
its accuracy in ChD has not been tested.
OBJECTIVE: To analyze the ability of AI to recognize LVSD in patients with ChD, 
defined as a left ventricular ejection fraction determined by the Echocardiogram 
≤ 40%.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This is a cross-sectional study of ECG obtained 
from a large cohort of patients with ChD named São Paulo-Minas Gerais Tropical 
Medicine Research Center (SaMi-Trop) Study. The digital ECGs of the participants 
were submitted to the analysis of the trained machine to detect LVSD. The 
diagnostic performance of the AI-enabled ECG to detect LVSD was tested using an 
echocardiogram as the gold standard to detect LVSD, defined as an ejection 
fraction <40%. The model was enriched with NT-proBNP plasma levels, male sex, 
and QRS ≥ 120ms. Among the 1,304 participants of this study, 67% were women, 
median age of 60; there were 93 (7.1%) individuals with LVSD. Most patients had 
major ECG abnormalities (59.5%). The AI algorithm identified LVSD among ChD 
patients with an odds ratio of 63.3 (95% CI 32.3-128.9), a sensitivity of 73%, a 
specificity of 83%, an overall accuracy of 83%, and a negative predictive value 
of 97%; the AUC was 0.839. The model adjusted for the male sex and QRS ≥ 120ms 
improved the AUC to 0.859. The model adjusted for the male sex and elevated 
NT-proBNP had a higher accuracy of 0.89 and an AUC of 0.874.
CONCLUSION: The AI analysis of the ECG of Chagas disease patients can be 
transformed into a powerful tool for the recognition of LVSD.

University, Lublin, Poland. bgawda@wp.pl.

The current study was designed to show the differentiation of narrative styles 
in individuals with high scores in Psychopathic deviate (Pd) scale and develop a 
method enabling identification of psychopathic personality traits based on 
linguistic indicators. 600 spontaneous narrations related to emotional topics 
have been examined for grammar, syntactic, and lexical indicators. The 
indicators have been selected based on a review related to language of 
psychopaths. The narrations were written by 200 persons who were also tested for 
psychopathic deviate and intelligence level, including prisoners diagnosed with 
antisocial personality disorder. Independent judges identified the linguistic 
indicators which were then counted for each person with the use of computer 
software. The configuration profiles of the linguistic indicators/narrative 
styles were established using k-mean clustering method. Then, ANOVA was 
performed to show which clusters differentiate the levels of psychopathic 
deviate. The findings show there are two configurations of language features 
(important: single features were not examined) associated with high levels of 
psychopathic deviate patterns. Two narrative styles were identified, labelled 
demonstrative-digressive-egocentric-emotional-dogmatic and reserved-focused on 
the topic-repetitive, which indicate high psychopathic deviate traits. The ROC 
curves were applied to establish the prediction of the narrative styles for high 
psychopathic deviate scores.

BACKGROUND: Computer tools based on artificial intelligence could aid clinicians 
in memory clinics in several ways, such as by supporting diagnostic 
decision-making, web-based cognitive testing, and the communication of diagnosis 
and prognosis.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify the preferences as well as the main 
barriers and facilitators related to using computer tools in memory clinics for 
all end users, that is, clinicians, patients, and care partners.
METHODS: Between July and October 2020, we sent out invitations to a web-based 
survey to clinicians using the European Alzheimer's Disease Centers network and 
the Dutch Memory Clinic network, and 109 clinicians participated (mean age 45 
years, SD 10; 53/109, 48.6% female). A second survey was created for patients 
and care partners. They were invited via Alzheimer Europe, Alzheimer's Society 
United Kingdom, Amsterdam Dementia Cohort, and Amsterdam Aging Cohort. A total 
of 50 patients with subjective cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, or 
dementia (mean age 73 years, SD 8; 17/34, 34% female) and 46 care partners (mean 
age 65 years, SD 12; 25/54, 54% female) participated in this survey.
RESULTS: Most clinicians reported a willingness to use diagnostic (88/109, 
80.7%) and prognostic (83/109, 76.1%) computer tools. User-friendliness (71/109, 
65.1%); Likert scale mean 4.5, SD 0.7), and increasing diagnostic accuracy 
(76/109, 69.7%; mean 4.3, SD 0.7) were reported as the main factors stimulating 
the adoption of a tool. Tools should also save time and provide clear 
information on reliability and validity. Inadequate integration with electronic 
patient records (46/109, 42.2%; mean 3.8, SD 1.0) and fear of losing important 
clinical information (48/109, 44%; mean 3.7, SD 1.2) were most frequently 
indicated as barriers. Patients and care partners were equally positive about 
the use of computer tools by clinicians, both for diagnosis (69/96, 72%) and 
prognosis (73/96, 76%). In addition, most of them thought favorably regarding 
the possibility of using the tools themselves.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that computer tools in memory clinics are 
positively valued by most end users. For further development and implementation, 
it is essential to overcome the technical and practical barriers of a tool while 
paying utmost attention to its reliability and validity.

BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is often a precursor of dementia, 
and patients with MCI develop dementia at a higher rate than healthy older 
adults. Early detection of cognitive decline at the MCI stage supports better 
planning of care and interventions. At present, the use of virtual reality (VR) 
in screening for MCI in older adults is promising, but there is little evidence 
regarding the use of virtual supermarkets to screen for MCI.
OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study are to validate a VR game-based test, 
namely, the Virtual Supermarket Program (VSP), for differentiating patients with 
MCI and healthy controls and to identify cutoff scores for different age levels.
METHODS: Subjects were recruited from several nursing homes and communities in 
Changchun, China. They were divided into a healthy control group (n=64) and an 
MCI group (n=62). All subjects were administered the VSP and a series of 
neuropsychological examinations. The study determined the optimal cutoff, 
discriminating validity, concurrent validity, and retest reliability of the VSP. 
We used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to 
evaluate the discriminating validity and obtain the optimal cutoff values. 
Pearson correlation analysis and the intraclass correlation coefficient were 
used to evaluate the concurrent validity and retest reliability, respectively.
RESULTS: A cutoff score of 46.4 was optimal for the entire sample, yielding a 
sensitivity of 85.9% and specificity of 79.0% for differentiating individuals 
with MCI and healthy controls, and the AUC was 0.870 (95% CI 0.799-0.924). The 
median index of VSP score was 51.1 (range 42.6-60.0). There was a moderate 
positive correlation between the VSP total score and Mini-Mental State 
Examination score (r=0.429, P<.001). There was a strong positive correlation 
between VSP total score and Montreal Cognitive Assessment score (r=0.645, 
P<.001). The retest reliability of the VSP was feasible (r=0.588, P=.048).
CONCLUSIONS: The VSP is interesting and feasible for subjects. It shows high 
sensitivity and specificity for the identification of MCI in older adults, which 
makes it a promising screening method. The VSP may be generalized to older 
adults in other countries, although some cultural adaptation may be necessary.

In digital medicine, patient data typically record health events over time (eg, 
through electronic health records, wearables, or other sensing technologies) and 
thus form unique patient trajectories. Patient trajectories are highly 
predictive of the future course of diseases and therefore facilitate effective 
care. However, digital medicine often uses only limited patient data, consisting 
of health events from only a single or small number of time points while 
ignoring additional information encoded in patient trajectories. To analyze such 
rich longitudinal data, new artificial intelligence (AI) solutions are needed. 
In this paper, we provide an overview of the recent efforts to develop 
trajectory-aware AI solutions and provide suggestions for future directions. 
Specifically, we examine the implications for developing disease models from 
patient trajectories along the typical workflow in AI: problem definition, data 
processing, modeling, evaluation, and interpretation. We conclude with a 
discussion of how such AI solutions will allow the field to build robust models 
for personalized risk scoring, subtyping, and disease pathway discovery.

Validity evaluation is fundamental in neuropsychological assessment in adults, 
with increasing interest among pediatric neuropsychologists. Although some 
measures exist, given time constraints placed on clinicians, and children's 
limited sustained attention, development of less time-consuming measures is 
beneficial. We explored the use of the Temporal Memory Sequence Test (TMST), a 
new performance validity test, in clinically referred children. One minor 
adaptation included reading the instructions and labels to non-fluent readers. 
Participants were 68 consecutive clinically referred children and adolescents, 
aged 6-18 years, with neurological (n = 46) or behavioral (n = 22) difficulties. 
Applying the adult cutoff, 83.8% passed the TMST. Age, gender, and diagnosis did 
not differ between children passing the TMST cutoff and those who failed it. 
Classification accuracy calculated against three embedded measures of 
performance validity (Wechsler scale Digit Span, Coding, and Processing Speed 
Index) indicated specificity over 90% (Digit Span: 94%, Coding: 96%, Processing 
Speed Index: 92%) and sensitivity between 30 and 33%. For individuals without 
Intellectual Disability (ID), 90.9% passed the TMST, and intelligence did not 
predict success. Thus, the use of the TMST with the adult cutoff was supported 
in children without ID, offering an additional validity measure for clinically 
referred children.

OBJECTIVES: Cognitive reserve provides evidence in the search for answers 
regarding the role that lifestyle has in the protection of cognition in old age. 
Through a structural equations model, different things were analyzed: the 
relative weight of education, occupational complexity, free time activities and 
the intelligence quotient in cognitive reserve; and its impact on three 
cognitive domains: memory, language and executive functions.
DESIGN: A trail analysis was executed, using structural equations procedure.
PARTICIPANTS: 167 older participants (mean = 76.74 years, standard deviation = 
6.8 years).
MEASUREMENTS: Participants were assessed with: Sociodemographic Questionnaire, 
Occupational Activity Agency Questionnaire, Social Participation Questionnaire 
and Neuropsychological Evaluation Battery for: memory, language and executive 
functions.
RESULTS: The cognitive reserve factor is well represented by the measures 
included, with values ​​between .43 and .86, and shows a direct effect on 
language (β = .52, p < .001), executive functions (β = .77, p <.001), and memory 
(β = .36, p = .003).
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, lifestyle factors, such as education, occupational 
complexity, leisure time activities and intelligence quotient have an impact on 
the conformation of cognitive reserve and performance in some psychological 
processes.

The rapid development of consumer electronics, artificial intelligence, and 
clinical medicine generates an increasing demand for flexible pressure sensors, 
whose performance depends significantly on sensitive materials with high 
flexibility and proper conductivity. MXene, a type of 2D nanomaterial, has 
attracted extensive attention due to its good electrical conductivity, 
hydrophilicity, and flexibility. The synthesis methods for MXenes make it 
relatively easy to control their microstructure and surface termination groups. 
Hence, MXenes can obtain peculiar microstructures and facilely combine with 
other functional materials, making them promising prospects for use in flexible 
pressure sensors. In this Review, recent advances in MXenes are summarized, 
mainly focusing on the synthesis methods and their application in flexible 
pressure sensors. Finally, the challenges and potential solutions for future 
development are also discussed.

The SARS-CoV-2 virus has caused tremendous healthcare burden worldwide. Our 
focus was to develop a practical and easy-to-deploy system to predict the severe 
manifestation of disease in patients with COVID-19 with an aim to assist 
clinicians in triage and treatment decisions. Our proposed predictive algorithm 
is a trained artificial intelligence-based network using 8,427 COVID-19 patient 
records from four healthcare systems. The model provides a severity risk score 
along with likelihoods of various clinical outcomes, namely ventilator use and 
mortality. The trained model using patient age and nine laboratory markers has 
the prediction accuracy with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.78, 95% CI: 
0.77-0.82, and the negative predictive value NPV of 0.86, 95% CI: 0.84-0.88 for 
the need to use a ventilator and has an accuracy with AUC of 0.85, 95% CI: 
0.84-0.86, and the NPV of 0.94, 95% CI: 0.92-0.96 for predicting in-hospital 
30-day mortality.

We review the history of nuclear medicine physics, instrumentation, and data 
sciences in Korea to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Korean Society of 
Nuclear Medicine. In the 1970s and 1980s, the development of SPECT, nuclear 
stethoscope, and bone densitometry systems, as well as kidney and cardiac image 
analysis technology, marked the beginning of nuclear medicine physics and 
engineering in Korea. With the introduction of PET and cyclotron in Korea in 
1994, nuclear medicine imaging research was further activated. With the support 
of large-scale government projects, the development of gamma camera, SPECT, and 
PET systems was carried out. Exploiting the use of PET scanners in conjunction 
with cyclotrons, extensive studies on myocardial blood flow quantification and 
brain image analysis were also actively pursued. In 2005, Korea's first domestic 
cyclotron succeeded in producing radioactive isotopes, and the cyclotron was 
provided to six universities and university hospitals, thereby facilitating the 
nationwide supply of PET radiopharmaceuticals. Since the late 2000s, research on 
PET/MRI has been actively conducted, and the advanced research results of Korean 
scientists in the fields of silicon photomultiplier PET and simultaneous PET/MRI 
have attracted significant attention from the academic community. Currently, 
Korean researchers are actively involved in endeavors to solve a variety of 
complex problems in nuclear medicine using artificial intelligence and deep 
learning technologies.

Exponential development in artificial intelligence or deep learning technology 
has resulted in more trials to systematically determine the pathological 
diagnoses using whole slide images (WSIs) in clinical and nonclinical studies. 
In this study, we applied Mask Regions with Convolution Neural Network (Mask 
R-CNN), a deep learning model that uses instance segmentation, to detect hepatic 
fibrosis induced by N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) in Sprague-Dawley rats. From 
51 WSIs, we collected 2011 cropped images with hepatic fibrosis annotations. 
Training and detection of hepatic fibrosis via artificial intelligence methods 
was performed using Tensorflow 2.1.0, powered by an NVIDIA 2080 Ti GPU. From the 
test process using tile images, 95% of model accuracy was verified. In addition, 
we validated the model to determine whether the predictions by the trained model 
can reflect the scoring system by the pathologists at the WSI level. The 
validation was conducted by comparing the model predictions in 18 WSIs at 20× 
and 10× magnifications with ground truth annotations and board-certified 
pathologists. Predictions at 20× showed a high correlation with ground truth (R2 
= 0.9660) and a good correlation with the average fibrosis rank by pathologists 
(R2 = 0.8887). Therefore, the Mask R-CNN algorithm is a useful tool for 
detecting and quantifying pathological findings in nonclinical studies.

Advanced parental age at offspring birth has been associated with autism 
spectrum disorder (ASD). The objective of the current study was to investigate 
associations between parental age at birth and autism severity. The Rhode Island 
Consortium for Autism Research and Treatment (RI-CART) study represents a 
community-based sample with a range of autism severity, including participants 
with and without ASD. This study involved participants (n = 1178) enrolled in 
RI-CART with available mother and father ages at birth. Primary data points 
included the age of mother and father at the participant's birth and results 
from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule - Second Edition (ADOS-2). 
Mothers were 1.7 years older at the time of birth of the child with ASD, as 
compared to mothers of offspring without ASD. Fathers of children with ASD were 
1.6 years older at the time of birth than fathers of children without ASD. The 
age of both parents at offspring birth displayed a positive, statistically 
significant association with overall ASD severity and the severity of 
restricted/repetitive behaviors. This finding was driven by the association 
between parental age and the severity of compulsions or rituals. Intelligence 
and adaptive functioning did not moderate the relationship between parental age 
and ASD severity. This study extends prior research to show that advanced 
parental age at birth is associated with the severity as well as the presence of 
ASD in offspring.

BACKGROUND: In December 2019, we ran Pacific Eclipse, a pandemic tabletop 
exercise using smallpox originating in Fiji as a case study. Pacific Eclipse 
brought together international stakeholders from health, defence, law 
enforcement, emergency management and a range of other organisations.
AIM: To review potential gaps in preparedness and identify modifiable factors 
which could prevent a pandemic or mitigate the impact of a pandemic.
METHODS: Pacific Eclipse was held on December 9-10 in Washington DC, Phoenix and 
Honolulu simultaneously. The scenario began in Fiji and becomes a pandemic. 
Mathematical modelling of smallpox transmission was used to simulate the 
epidemic under different conditions and to test the effect of interventions. 
Live polling, using Poll Everywhere software that participants downloaded onto 
their smart phones, was used to gather participant decisions as the scenario 
unfolded. Stakeholders from state and federal government and non-government 
organisations from The United States, The United Kingdom, Australia, New 
Zealand, Canada, as well as industry and non-government organisations attended.
RESULTS: The scenario progressed in three phases and participants were able to 
make decisions during each phase using live polling. The polling showed very 
diverse and sometimes conflicting decision making. Factors influential to 
pandemic severity were identified and categorised as modifiable or unmodifiable. 
A series of recommendations were made on the modifiable determinants of pandemic 
severity and how these can be incorporated into pandemic planning. These 
included preventing an attack through intelligence, law enforcement and 
legislation, improved speed of diagnosis, speed and completeness of case finding 
and case isolation, speed and security of vaccination response (including 
stockpiling), speed and completeness of contact tracing, protecting critical 
infrastructure and business continuity, non-pharmaceutical interventions (social 
distancing, PPE, border control) and protecting first responders.
DISCUSSION: Pacific Eclipse illustrated the impact of a pandemic of smallpox 
under different response scenarios, which were validated to some extent by the 
COVID-19 pandemic. The framework developed from the scenario draws out 
modifiable determinants of pandemic severity which can inform pandemic planning 
for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and for future pandemics.

OBJECTIVE: To prospectively investigate the association between personal 
activity intelligence (PAI) - a novel metabolic metric which translates heart 
rate during physical activity into a simple weekly score - and mortality in 
relatively healthy participants in China whose levels and patterns of physical 
activity in addition to other lifestyle factors are different from those in 
high-income countries.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: From the population-based China Kadoorie Biobank study, 
443,792 healthy adults were recruited between June 2004 and July 2008. 
Participant's weekly PAI score was estimated and divided into four groups (PAI 
scores of 0, ≤50, 51-99, or ≥100). Using Cox proportional hazard analyses, we 
calculated adjusted hazard ratios (AHRs) for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and 
all-cause mortality related to PAI scores.
RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 8.2 (interquartile range, 7.3 to 9.1) 
years, there were 21,901 deaths, including 9466 CVD deaths. Compared with the 
inactive group (0 PAI score), a baseline weekly PAI score greater than or equal 
to 100 was associated with a lower risk of CVD mortality, an AHR of 0.87 (95% 
CI, 0.81 to 0.94) in men, and an AHR of 0.84 (95% CI, 0.78 to 0.92) in women, 
after adjusting for multiple confounders. Participants with a weekly PAI score 
greater than or equal to 100 also had a lower risk of all-cause mortality (AHR, 
0.93; 95% CI, 0.89 to 0.97 in men, and AHR, 0.93; 95%, 0.88 to 0.98 in women). 
Moreover, this subgroup gained 2.7 (95% CI, 2.4 to 3.0) years of life, compared 
with the inactive cohort.
CONCLUSION: Among relatively healthy Chinese adults, the PAI metric was 
inversely associated with CVD and all-cause mortality, highlighting the 
generalizability of the score in different races, ethnicities, and socioeconomic 
strata.

Molecular modeling in pharmacology is a promising emerging tool for exploring 
drug interactions with cellular components. Recent advances in molecular 
simulations, big data analysis, and artificial intelligence (AI) have opened new 
opportunities for rationalizing drug interactions with their pharmacological 
targets. Despite the obvious utility and increasing impact of computational 
approaches, their development is not progressing at the same speed in different 
fields of pharmacology. Here, we review current in silico techniques used in 
cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), cardiological drug discovery, and assessment of 
cardiotoxicity. In silico techniques are paving the way to a new era in 
cardiovascular medicine, but their use somewhat lags behind that in other 
fields.

While COVID-19 is still ongoing and associated with more than 5 million deaths, 
the scope and speed of advances over the past year in terms of scientific 
discovery, data dissemination, and technology have been staggering. It is not a 
matter of "if" but "when" we will face the next pandemic, and how we leverage 
technology and data management effectively to create flexible ecosystems that 
facilitate collaboration, equitable care, and innovation will determine its 
severity and scale. The aim of this review is to address emerging challenges 
that came to light during the pandemic in health care and innovations that 
enabled us to adapt and continue to care for patients. The pandemic highlighted 
the need for seismic shifts in care paradigms and technology with considerations 
related to the digital divide and health literacy for digital health 
interventions to reach full potential and improve health outcomes. We discuss 
advances in telemedicine, remote patient monitoring, and emerging wearable 
technologies. Despite the promise of digital health, we emphasise the importance 
of addressing its limitations, including interpretation challenges, accuracy of 
findings, and artificial intelligence-driven algorithms. We summarise the most 
recent recommendation of the Virtual Care Task Force to scaling virtual medical 
services in Canada. Finally, we propose a model for optimal implementation of 
health digital innovations with 5 tenets including data management, data 
security, digital biomarkers, useful artificial intelligence, and clinical 
integration.

Alors que la pandémie, toujours en cours, a causé plus de cinq millions de 
décès, la portée et la rapidité des avancées réalisées au cours de la dernière 
année en matière de découverte scientifique, de communication des données et sur 
le plan technologique ont été stupéfiantes. Il ne s’agit pas de savoir « si », 
mais plutôt « quand » nous devrons faire face à la prochaine pandémie, et son 
ampleur et sa gravité dépendront de l’efficacité avec laquelle nous exploiterons 
la technologie et la gestion des données pour créer des écosystèmes flexibles, 
qui faciliteront la collaboration, permettront d’offrir des soins équitables et 
favoriseront l’innovation. Le présent article de synthèse vise à cerner les 
défis émergents dans le domaine des soins de santé mis en lumière durant la 
pandémie et les innovations qui nous ont permis de nous adapter et de continuer 
à offrir des soins aux patients. La pandémie a révélé la nécessité de modifier 
radicalement les paradigmes de soins et l’utilisation des technologies en tenant 
compte de considérations liées à la fracture numérique et à la littératie en 
santé pour que les interventions numériques en santé atteignent leur plein 
potentiel et améliorent les résultats de santé. Nous aborderons les progrès de 
la télémédecine, la surveillance des patients à distance et les technologies 
portables émergentes. Malgré les promesses de la santé numérique, nous insistons 
sur l’importance de saisir ses limites, y compris les défis d’interprétation, 
l’exactitude des données et les algorithmes axés sur l’intelligence 
artificielle. Nous résumons les plus récentes recommandations du Groupe de 
travail sur les soins virtuels pour créer un cadre pancanadien. Finalement, nous 
proposons un modèle pour la mise en œuvre optimale des innovations en matière de 
santé numérique, lequel repose sur cinq principes, y compris la gestion des 
données, la sécurité des données, les biomarqueurs numériques, l’intelligence 
artificielle utile et l’intégration clinique.

PURPOSE: MR image quality and subsequent brain morphometric analysis are 
inevitably affected by noise. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the 
effectiveness of an artificial intelligence (AI)-based post-scan processing 
denoising system, intelligent Quick Magnetic Resonance (iQMR), on MR image 
quality and brain morphometric analysis.
METHODS: We used 1.5T MP-RAGE MR images acquired from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative 1 database. The images of 21 subjects were used for 
cross-sectional analysis and 15 for longitudinal analysis. In the longitudinal 
analysis, two timepoints over a 2-year interval were used. Each subject was 
scanned twice at each timepoint. MR images processed with and without the 
denoising system were compared both visually and objectively using FreeSurfer 
cortical thickness analysis.
RESULTS: The denoising system reduced the noise with good white-gray matter 
contrast (noise: p < 0.001; contrast: p = 0.49). The mean intraclass correlation 
coefficients (ICCs) of cortical thickness were slightly better in the images 
processed with the denoising system (0.739/0.859/0.883; Gaussian smoothing 
kernel of full width at half maximum = 0/10/20) compared with the unprocessed 
images (0.718/0.854/0.880). In the longitudinal analysis, the mean ICCs of 
symmetrized percent change improved in images processed with the denoising 
system (0.202/0.349/0.431) compared with the unprocessed images 
(0.167/0.325/0.404). In addition, the detectability of significant cortical 
thickness atrophy improved with denoising.
CONCLUSION: We confirm that the AI-based denoising system could effectively 
reduce the noise while retaining the contrast. We also confirm the improvement 
of the reliability and detectability of brain morphometric analysis with the 
denoising system.

OBJECTIVE: To assess whether an electrocardiography-based artificial 
intelligence (AI) algorithm developed to detect severe ventricular dysfunction 
(left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] of 35% or below) independently 
predicts long-term mortality after cardiac surgery among patients without severe 
ventricular dysfunction (LVEF>35%).
METHODS: Patients who underwent valve or coronary bypass surgery at Mayo Clinic 
(1993-2019) and had documented LVEF above 35% on baseline electrocardiography 
were included. We compared patients with an abnormal vs a normal AI-enhanced 
electrocardiogram (AI-ECG) screen for LVEF of 35% or below on preoperative 
electrocardiography. The primary end point was all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 20,627 patients were included, of whom 17,125 (83.0%) had a 
normal AI-ECG screen and 3502 (17.0%) had an abnormal AI-ECG screen. Patients 
with an abnormal AI-ECG screen were older and had more comorbidities. 
Probability of survival at 5 and 10 years was 86.2% and 68.2% in patients with a 
normal AI-ECG screen vs 71.4% and 45.1% in those with an abnormal screen 
(log-rank, P<.01). In the multivariate Cox survival analysis, the abnormal 
AI-ECG screen was independently associated with a higher all-cause mortality 
overall (hazard ratio [HR], 1.31; 95% CI, 1.24 to 1.37) and in subgroups of 
isolated valve surgery (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.18 to 1.42), isolated coronary 
artery bypass grafting (HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.20 to 1.39), and combined coronary 
artery bypass grafting and valve surgery (HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.32). In a 
subgroup analysis, the association between abnormal AI-ECG screen and mortality 
was consistent in patients with LVEF of 35% to 55% and among those with LVEF 
above 55%.
CONCLUSION: A novel electrocardiography-based AI algorithm that predicts severe 
ventricular dysfunction can predict long-term mortality among patients with LVEF 
above 35% undergoing valve and/or coronary bypass surgery.

Buchwald-Hartwig amination reaction catalyzed by palladium plays an important 
role in drug synthesis. In the last few years, machine learning-assisted 
strategies emerged and quickly gained attention. In this article, an importance 
and relevance-based integrated feature screening method is proposed to 
effectively filter high-dimensional feature descriptor data. Then, a regularized 
machine learning boosting tree model, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, is introduced 
to intelligently predict reaction performance in multidimensional chemistry 
space. Furthermore, convergence, interpretability, generalization, and the 
internal association between reaction conditions and yields are excavated, which 
provides intelligent assistance for the optimal design of coupling reaction 
system and evaluating the reaction conditions. Compared with recently published 
results, the proposed method requires fewer feature descriptors, takes less 
time, and achieves more accurate prediction accuracy.

Diabetes mellitus has been an increasing concern owing to its high morbidity, 
and the average age of individual affected by of individual affected by this 
disease has now decreased to mid-twenties. Given the high prevalence, it is 
necessary to address with this problem effectively. Many researchers and doctors 
have now developed detection techniques based on artificial intelligence to 
better approach problems that are missed due to human errors. Data mining 
techniques with algorithms such as - density-based spatial clustering of 
applications with noise and ordering points to identify the cluster structure, 
the use of machine vision systems to learn data on facial images, gain better 
features for model training, and diagnosis via presentation of iridocyclitis for 
detection of the disease through iris patterns have been deployed by various 
practitioners. Machine learning classifiers such as support vector machines, 
logistic regression, and decision trees, have been comparative discussed various 
authors. Deep learning models such as artificial neural networks and recurrent 
neural networks have been considered, with primary focus on long short-term 
memory and convolutional neural network architectures in comparison with other 
machine learning models. Various parameters such as the root-mean-square error, 
mean absolute errors, area under curves, and graphs with varying criteria are 
commonly used. In this study, challenges pertaining to data inadequacy and model 
deployment are discussed. The future scope of such methods has also been 
discussed, and new methods are expected to enhance the performance of existing 
models, allowing them to attain greater insight into the conditions on which the 
prevalence of the disease depends.

Currently news and/or articles on the use of Artificial Intelligence and the Big 
Data are flooding us and this situation has worsened with the pandemic, where 
great importance has been given to its use and the various applications in all 
sectors. Some areas of technology and opportunities that are increasingly are 
more present in our day to day. The sector that has experienced the most growth 
during this time of pandemic is, without a doubt, the Health sector. The 
imperative need has fostered and expedited the use of these technologies. The 
use of data to be able to undertake treatments in a short time, see the 
evolutions of the different diseases and predict their state is what has driven 
its use and where due to the situation any help was and is little. From this 
article we intend to give an explanation of the benefits of using the Artificial 
Intelligence and the different Big Data techniques, both in the study and 
evolution of diseases as in their prevention, detection, monitoring and 
treatment.

AIM: Given the prolongation of the newly emerging COVID-19 pandemic and the 
significance of caring for the patients by nursing staff, investigating and 
planning for the different psychological dimensions of this group is of 
paramount importance. Hence, this study investigated the role of spiritual 
intelligence in predicting nurses' empathizing with COVID-19 patients.
METHODS: This descriptive-correlation study was conducted in 2021 on nurses 
caring for COVID-19 patients in three public hospitals. The researchers used two 
standard questionnaires, including the Jefferson Scale of Empathy (JSE) and 
Spiritual Intelligence (SI), for data collection. The collected data were 
analyzed in SPSS16 using descriptive statistics and the following: The 
Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis test, Regression, chi-square test, and 
Pearson and Spearman correlations.
RESULTS: The statistical population consisted of 338 nurses with an average age 
of 34 and ten years of work experience. There was a significant positive 
relationship between the empathy scores and spiritual intelligence scores of the 
nurses caring for COVID-19 patients (P < 0.05). It was also concluded from the 
regression analysis that, spiritual intelligence affect empathy. Mean score of 
empathy was higher in hospitals where more nursing staff had MSc degrees. There 
was a significant difference between the empathy scores of the three hospitals 
(P < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The results indicated that there is a positive relationship between 
empathy and spiritual intelligence. Therefor improving spiritual intelligence is 
the appropriate strategy to ameliorate empathy during the COVID19 pandemic. At 
the same time, study indicated attention to the issue of nurses' mental health. 
Hence, it was suggested to incorporate these issues in the training programs and 
national/international decisions.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: This experimental study was designed using pretest, posttest, 
follow-up, and control group models to explore the effect of a structured 
education program on adolescents' psychological resilience and emotional 
intelligence level.
METHOD: This study was conducted on 70 students at a high school in Turkey. A 
total of 36 students were assigned to the intervention group and 34 students to 
the control group. Data were collected using the Adolescent Information Form, 
Resilience Scale (RS), and Emotional Intelligence Evaluation Scale (EIES). The 
scales were administered in the intervention group before initializing the 
education program, who later received a 7-week education program. One month 
after the administration of the education program, the scales were again 
administered during follow-up.
FINDINGS: It was found that the education program improved and increased 
adolescents' psychological resilience and total emotional intelligence level 
despite not being significant (p > 0.05). During the follow-up, adolescents in 
the intervention group demonstrated an important difference in follow-up scores 
in the optimism and communication subdimensions of the RS compared to that in 
the posttest scores, and the intervention group had a higher average total score 
in the EIES compared to that in students in the control group (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the training program has positive effects 
on improving adolescents' psychological resilience and emotional intelligence 
levels, especially in the long run, which needs to be developed and applied in 
different samples.

BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) are the two most 
frightful and unpleasant side effects of chemotherapy. CINV is accountable for 
poor treatment outcomes, treatment failure, or even death. It can affect 
patients' overall quality of life, leading to many social, economic, and 
clinical consequences.
OBJECTIVE: This study compared the performances of different data mining models 
for predicting the risk of CINV among the patients and developed a smartphone 
app for clinical decision support to recommend the risk of CINV at the point of 
care.
METHODS: Data were collected by retrospective record review from the electronic 
medical records used at the University of Missouri Ellis Fischel Cancer Center. 
Patients who received chemotherapy and standard antiemetics at the oncology 
outpatient service from June 1, 2010, to July 31, 2012, were included in the 
study. There were six independent data sets of patients based on emetogenicity 
(low, moderate, and high) and two phases of CINV (acute and delayed). A total of 
14 risk factors of CINV were chosen for data mining. For our study, we used five 
popular data mining algorithms: (1) naive Bayes algorithm, (2) logistic 
regression classifier, (3) neural network, (4) support vector machine (using 
sequential minimal optimization), and (5) decision tree. Performance measures, 
such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity with 10-fold cross-validation, 
were used for model comparisons. A smartphone app called CINV Risk Prediction 
Application was developed using the ResearchKit in iOS utilizing the decision 
tree algorithm, which conforms to the criteria of explainable, usable, and 
actionable artificial intelligence. The app was created using both the bulk 
questionnaire approach and the adaptive approach.
RESULTS: The decision tree performed well in both phases of high emetogenic 
chemotherapies, with a significant margin compared to the other algorithms. The 
accuracy measure for the six patient groups ranged from 79.3% to 94.8%. The app 
was developed using the results from the decision tree because of its consistent 
performance and simple, explainable nature. The bulk questionnaire approach asks 
14 questions in the smartphone app, while the adaptive approach can determine 
questions based on the previous questions' answers. The adaptive approach saves 
time and can be beneficial when used at the point of care.
CONCLUSIONS: This study solved a real clinical problem, and the solution can be 
used for personalized and precise evidence-based CINV management, leading to a 
better life quality for patients and reduced health care costs.

BACKGROUND: As poor diet quality is a significant risk factor for multiple 
noncommunicable diseases prevalent in the United States, it is important that 
methods be developed to accurately capture eating behavior data. There is 
growing interest in the use of ecological momentary assessments to collect data 
on health behaviors and their predictors on a micro timescale (at different 
points within or across days); however, documenting eating behaviors remains a 
challenge.
OBJECTIVE: This pilot study (N=48) aims to examine the feasibility-usability and 
acceptability-of using smartphone-captured and crowdsource-labeled images to 
document eating behaviors in real time.
METHODS: Participants completed the Block Fat/Sugar/Fruit/Vegetable Screener to 
provide a measure of their typical eating behavior, then took pictures of their 
meals and snacks and answered brief survey questions for 7 consecutive days 
using a commercially available smartphone app. Participant acceptability was 
determined through a questionnaire regarding their experiences administered at 
the end of the study. The images of meals and snacks were uploaded to Amazon 
Mechanical Turk (MTurk), a crowdsourcing distributed human intelligence 
platform, where 2 Workers assigned a count of food categories to the images 
(fruits, vegetables, salty snacks, and sweet snacks). The agreement among MTurk 
Workers was assessed, and weekly food counts were calculated and compared with 
the Screener responses.
RESULTS: Participants reported little difficulty in uploading photographs and 
remembered to take photographs most of the time. Crowdsource-labeled images 
(n=1014) showed moderate agreement between the MTurk Worker responses for 
vegetables (688/1014, 67.85%) and high agreement for all other food categories 
(871/1014, 85.89% for fruits; 847/1014, 83.53% for salty snacks, and 833/1014, 
81.15% for sweet snacks). There were no significant differences in weekly food 
consumption between the food images and the Block Screener, suggesting that this 
approach may measure typical eating behaviors as accurately as traditional 
methods, with lesser burden on participants.
CONCLUSIONS: Our approach offers a potentially time-efficient and cost-effective 
strategy for capturing eating events in real time.

Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common cancer type in males in the Western 
World. MRI has an established role in diagnosis of PCa through guiding biopsies. 
Due to multistep complex nature of the MRI-guided PCa diagnosis pathway, 
diagnostic performance has a big variation. Developing artificial intelligence 
(AI) models using machine learning, particularly deep learning, has an expanding 
role in radiology. Specifically, for prostate MRI, several AI approaches have 
been defined in the literature for prostate segmentation, lesion detection and 
classification with the aim of improving diagnostic performance and 
interobserver agreement. In this review article, we summarize the use of 
radiology applications of AI in prostate MRI.

Behavioral traits are rarely considered in task-evoked functional magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) studies, yet these traits can affect how an individual 
engages with the task, and thus lead to heterogeneity in task-evoked brain 
responses. We aimed to investigate whether interindividual variation in behavior 
associates with the accuracy of predicting task-evoked changes in the dynamics 
of functional brain connectivity measured with functional MRI. We developed a 
novel method called multi-timepoint pattern analysis (MTPA), in which binary 
logistic regression classifiers were trained to distinguish rest from each of 7 
tasks (i.e., social cognition, working memory, language, relational, motor, 
gambling, emotion) based on functional connectivity dynamics measured in 1,000 
healthy adults. We found that connectivity dynamics for multiple pairs of 
large-scale networks enabled individual classification between task and rest 
with accuracies exceeding 70%, with the most discriminatory connections 
relatively unique to each task. Crucially, interindividual variation in 
classification accuracy significantly associated with several behavioral, 
cognition and task performance measures. Classification between task and rest 
was generally more accurate for individuals with higher intelligence and task 
performance. Additionally, for some of the tasks, classification accuracy 
improved with lower perceived stress, lower aggression, higher alertness, and 
greater endurance. We conclude that heterogeneous dynamic adaptations of 
functional brain networks to changing cognitive demands can be reliably captured 
as linearly separable patterns by MTPA. Future studies should account for 
interindividual variation in behavior when investigating context-dependent 
dynamic functional connectivity.

OBJECTIVES: Worldwide, lung ultrasound (LUS) was utilized to assess coronavirus 
disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Often, imaging protocols were however defined 
arbitrarily and not following an evidence-based approach. Moreover, extensive 
studies on LUS in post-COVID-19 patients are currently lacking. This study 
analyses the impact of different LUS imaging protocols on the evaluation of 
COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 LUS data.
METHODS: LUS data from 220 patients were collected, 100 COVID-19 positive and 
120 post-COVID-19. A validated and standardized imaging protocol based on 14 
scanning areas and a 4-level scoring system was implemented. We utilized this 
dataset to compare the capability of 5 imaging protocols, respectively based on 
4, 8, 10, 12, and 14 scanning areas, to intercept the most important LUS 
findings. This to evaluate the optimal trade-off between a time-efficient 
imaging protocol and an accurate LUS examination. We also performed a 
longitudinal study, aimed at investigating how to eventually simplify the 
protocol during follow-up. Additionally, we present results on the agreement 
between AI models and LUS experts with respect to LUS data evaluation.
RESULTS: A 12-areas protocol emerges as the optimal trade-off, for both COVID-19 
and post-COVID-19 patients. For what concerns follow-up studies, it appears not 
to be possible to reduce the number of scanning areas. Finally, COVID-19 and 
post-COVID-19 LUS data seem to show differences capable to confuse AI models 
that were not trained on post-COVID-19 data, supporting the hypothesis of the 
existence of LUS patterns specific to post-COVID-19 patients.
CONCLUSIONS: A 12-areas acquisition protocol is recommended for both COVID-19 
and post-COVID-19 patients, also during follow-up.

With the global outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) all over the world, 
artificial intelligence (AI) technology is widely used in COVID-19 and has 
become a hot topic. In recent 2 years, the application of AI technology in 
COVID-19 has developed rapidly, and more than 100 relevant papers are published 
every month. In this paper, we combined with the bibliometric and visual 
knowledge map analysis, used the WOS database as the sample data source, and 
applied VOSviewer and CiteSpace analysis tools to carry out multi-dimensional 
statistical analysis and visual analysis about 1903 pieces of literature of 
recent 2 years (by the end of July this year). The data is analyzed by several 
terms with the main annual article and citation count, major publication 
sources, institutions and countries, their contribution and collaboration, etc. 
Since last year, the research on the COVID-19 has sharply increased; especially 
the corresponding research fields combined with the AI technology are expanding, 
such as medicine, management, economics, and informatics. The China and USA are 
the most prolific countries in AI applied in COVID-19, which have made a 
significant contribution to AI applied in COVID-19, as the high-level 
international collaboration of countries and institutions is increasing and more 
impactful. Moreover, we widely studied the issues: detection, surveillance, risk 
prediction, therapeutic research, virus modeling, and analysis of COVID-19. 
Finally, we put forward perspective challenges and limits to the application of 
AI in the COVID-19 for researchers and practitioners to facilitate future 
research on AI applied in COVID-19.

Gridization is an alternative way to create macromolecules of various sizes in 
addition to linear and dendritic polymerization as well as cyclization. Organic 
nanogrids are an expanding family of macrocycle-like closed structures at the 
nanoscale, but with a series of well-defined extension edges and vertices. 
Cyclic nanogrids can be used as nanoscale building blocks for the fabrication of 
not only rotaxanes, catenanes, knots, 3D cages, but also nanopolymers, covalent 
organic frameworks (COFs), metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), and complex 
molecular cross-scale architectures. In this review, the history of 
fluorene-based macrocycles has first been explored, followed by the development 
of the synthetic methodologies; in particular, fluorene-based nanogrids are 
highlighted owing to their features and applications. Typically, fluorenes are 
fused arenes with a hybrid entity between tetrahedral Csp3 and Csp2. Four 
ingenious connection modes of fluorene-based macrocycles, including 2,7-, 3,6-, 
9,9-, and 2,9-linkages, fully demonstrate the geometric possibilities of the 
macrocycles and nanogrids. Such fluorene-based nanogrids will give birth to 
organic intelligence.

Breast cancer analysis implies that radiologists inspect mammograms to detect 
suspicious breast lesions and identify mass tumors. Artificial intelligence 
techniques offer automatic systems for breast mass segmentation to assist 
radiologists in their diagnosis. With the rapid development of deep learning and 
its application to medical imaging challenges, UNet and its variations is one of 
the state-of-the-art models for medical image segmentation that showed promising 
performance on mammography. In this paper, we propose an architecture, called 
Connected-UNets, which connects two UNets using additional modified skip 
connections. We integrate Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) in the two 
standard UNets to emphasize the contextual information within the 
encoder-decoder network architecture. We also apply the proposed architecture on 
the Attention UNet (AUNet) and the Residual UNet (ResUNet). We evaluated the 
proposed architectures on two publically available datasets, the Curated Breast 
Imaging Subset of Digital Database for Screening Mammography (CBIS-DDSM) and 
INbreast, and additionally on a private dataset. Experiments were also conducted 
using additional synthetic data using the cycle-consistent Generative 
Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) model between two unpaired datasets to augment

High-level quantum mechanical (QM) calculations are indispensable for accurate 
explanation of natural phenomena on the atomistic level. Their staggering 
computational cost, however, poses great limitations, which luckily can be 
lifted to a great extent by exploiting advances in artificial intelligence (AI). 
Here we introduce the general-purpose, highly transferable artificial 
intelligence-quantum mechanical method 1 (AIQM1). It approaches the accuracy of 
the gold-standard coupled cluster QM method with high computational speed of the 
approximate low-level semiempirical QM methods for the neutral, closed-shell 
species in the ground state. AIQM1 can provide accurate ground-state energies 
for diverse organic compounds as well as geometries for even challenging systems 
such as large conjugated compounds (fullerene C60) close to experiment. This 
opens an opportunity to investigate chemical compounds with previously 
unattainable speed and accuracy as we demonstrate by determining geometries of 
polyyne molecules-the task difficult for both experiment and theory. Noteworthy, 
our method's accuracy is also good for ions and excited-state properties, 
although the neural network part of AIQM1 was never fitted to these properties.

BACKGROUND: For unknown reasons, females outperform males on tests of 
psychomotor processing speed (PS), such as the Coding and Symbol Search subtests 
of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale.
METHOD: In the present study, the effects of intelligence, memory, personality, 
fine motor speed, gross motor dexterity, height, weight, age, sex, and education 
on psychomotor processing speed were studied in an outpatient sample (n = 130).
RESULTS: Moderate (r > .40) correlations were found between PS and verbal 
reasoning, nonverbal reasoning, verbal memory, and fine motor speed. Weak 
(r > .20) correlations were found between PS and gross motor dexterity, 
extraversion, education, weight, and sex. Females outperformed males in PS and 
in fine motor speed. Stepwise linear regression analysis indicated nonverbal 
reasoning, fine motor speed, and sex as independent predictors of PS.
CONCLUSIONS: One interpretation of the results is that the factors underlying 
sex differences in processing speed are not psychological but neurological or 
physiological in nature and therefore a wider variety of measures from these 
disciplines are needed for further studies. For clinical assessment purposes, 
psychological tests should preferably provide different norms for male and 
female PS scores.

BACKGROUND: Air pollution is one of the major environmental challenges cities 
worldwide face today. Planning healthy environments for all future populations, 
whilst considering the ongoing demand for urbanisation and provisions needed to 
combat climate change, remains a difficult task.
OBJECTIVE: To combine artificial intelligence (AI), atmospheric and social 
sciences to provide urban planning solutions that optimise local air quality by 
applying novel methods and taking into consideration population structures and 
traffic flows.
METHODS: We will use high-resolution spatial data and linked electronic 
population cohort for Helsinki Metropolitan Area (Finland) to model (a) 
population dynamics and urban inequality related to air pollution; (b) detailed 
aerosol dynamics, aerosol and gas-phase chemistry together with detailed flow 
characteristics; (c) high-resolution traffic flow addressing dynamical changes 
at the city environment, such as accidents, construction work and unexpected 
congestion. Finally, we will fuse the information resulting from these models 
into an optimal city planning model balancing air quality, comfort, 
accessibility and travelling efficiency.

PROBLEM/CONDITION: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
PERIOD COVERED: 2018.
DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM: The Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring 
Network is an active surveillance program that estimates ASD prevalence and 
monitors timing of ASD identification among children aged 4 and 8 years. This 
report focuses on children aged 4 years in 2018, who were born in 2014 and had a 
parent or guardian who lived in the surveillance area in one of 11 sites 
(Arizona, Arkansas, California, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, New 
Jersey, Tennessee, Utah, and Wisconsin) at any time during 2018. Children were 
classified as having ASD if they ever received 1) an ASD diagnostic statement 
(diagnosis) in an evaluation, 2) a special education classification of ASD 
(eligibility), or 3) an ASD International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code. 
Suspected ASD also was tracked among children aged 4 years. Children who did not 
meet the case definition for ASD were classified as having suspected ASD if 
their records contained a qualified professional's statement indicating a 
suspicion of ASD.
RESULTS: For 2018, the overall ASD prevalence was 17.0 per 1,000 (one in 59) 
children aged 4 years. Prevalence varied from 9.1 per 1,000 in Utah to 41.6 per 
1,000 in California. At every site, prevalence was higher among boys than girls, 
with an overall male-to-female prevalence ratio of 3.4. Prevalence of ASD among 
children aged 4 years was lower among non-Hispanic White (White) children (12.9 
per 1,000) than among non-Hispanic Black (Black) children (16.6 per 1,000), 
Hispanic children (21.1 per 1,000), and Asian/Pacific Islander (A/PI) children 
(22.7 per 1,000). Among children aged 4 years with ASD and information on 
intellectual ability, 52% met the surveillance case definition of co-occurring 
intellectual disability (intelligence quotient ≤70 or an examiner's statement of 
intellectual disability documented in an evaluation). Of children aged 4 years 
with ASD, 72% had a first evaluation at age ≤36 months. Stratified by 
census-tract-level median household income (MHI) tertile, a lower percentage of 
children with ASD and intellectual disability was evaluated by age 36 months in 
the low MHI tertile (72%) than in the high MHI tertile (84%). Cumulative 
incidence of ASD diagnosis or eligibility received by age 48 months was 1.5 
times as high among children aged 4 years (13.6 per 1,000 children born in 2014) 
as among those aged 8 years (8.9 per 1,000 children born in 2010). Across MHI 
tertiles, higher cumulative incidence of ASD diagnosis or eligibility received 
by age 48 months was associated with lower MHI. Suspected ASD prevalence was 2.6 
per 1,000 children aged 4 years, meaning for every six children with ASD, one 
child had suspected ASD. The combined prevalence of ASD and suspected ASD (19.7 
per 1,000 children aged 4 years) was lower than ASD prevalence among children 
aged 8 years (23.0 per 1,000 children aged 8 years).
INTERPRETATION: Groups with historically lower prevalence of ASD (non-White and 
lower MHI) had higher prevalence and cumulative incidence of ASD among children 
aged 4 years in 2018, suggesting progress in identification among these groups. 
However, a lower percentage of children with ASD and intellectual disability in 
the low MHI tertile were evaluated by age 36 months than in the high MHI group, 
indicating disparity in timely evaluation. Children aged 4 years had a higher 
cumulative incidence of diagnosis or eligibility by age 48 months compared with 
children aged 8 years, indicating improvement in early identification of ASD. 
The overall prevalence for children aged 4 years was less than children aged 8 
years, even when prevalence of children suspected of having ASD by age 4 years 
is included. This finding suggests that many children identified after age 4 
years do not have suspected ASD documented by age 48 months.
PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION: Children born in 2014 were more likely to be identified 
with ASD by age 48 months than children born in 2010, indicating increased early 
identification. However, ASD identification among children aged 4 years varied 
by site, suggesting opportunities to examine developmental screening and 
diagnostic practices that promote earlier identification. Children aged 4 years 
also were more likely to have co-occurring intellectual disability than children 
aged 8 years, suggesting that improvement in the early identification and 
evaluation of developmental concerns outside of cognitive impairments is still 
needed. Improving early identification of ASD could lead to earlier receipt of 
evidence-based interventions and potentially improve developmental outcomes.

PROBLEM/CONDITION: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
PERIOD COVERED: 2018.
DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM: The Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring 
(ADDM) Network conducts active surveillance of ASD. This report focuses on the 
prevalence and characteristics of ASD among children aged 8 years in 2018 whose 
parents or guardians lived in 11 ADDM Network sites in the United States 
(Arizona, Arkansas, California, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, New 
Jersey, Tennessee, Utah, and Wisconsin). To ascertain ASD among children aged 8 
years, ADDM Network staff review and abstract developmental evaluations and 
records from community medical and educational service providers. In 2018, 
children met the case definition if their records documented 1) an ASD 
diagnostic statement in an evaluation (diagnosis), 2) a special education 
classification of ASD (eligibility), or 3) an ASD International Classification 
of Diseases (ICD) code.
RESULTS: For 2018, across all 11 ADDM sites, ASD prevalence per 1,000 children 
aged 8 years ranged from 16.5 in Missouri to 38.9 in California. The overall ASD 
prevalence was 23.0 per 1,000 (one in 44) children aged 8 years, and ASD was 4.2 
times as prevalent among boys as among girls. Overall ASD prevalence was similar 
across racial and ethnic groups, except American Indian/Alaska Native children 
had higher ASD prevalence than non-Hispanic White (White) children (29.0 versus 
21.2 per 1,000 children aged 8 years). At multiple sites, Hispanic children had 
lower ASD prevalence than White children (Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, and Utah), 
and non-Hispanic Black (Black) children (Georgia and Minnesota). The 
associations between ASD prevalence and neighborhood-level median household 
income varied by site. Among the 5,058 children who met the ASD case definition, 
75.8% had a diagnostic statement of ASD in an evaluation, 18.8% had an ASD 
special education classification or eligibility and no ASD diagnostic statement, 
and 5.4% had an ASD ICD code only. ASD prevalence per 1,000 children aged 8 
years that was based exclusively on documented ASD diagnostic statements was 
17.4 overall (range: 11.2 in Maryland to 29.9 in California). The median age of 
earliest known ASD diagnosis ranged from 36 months in California to 63 months in 
Minnesota. Among the 3,007 children with ASD and data on cognitive ability, 
35.2% were classified as having an intelligence quotient (IQ) score ≤70. The 
percentages of children with ASD with IQ scores ≤70 were 49.8%, 33.1%, and 29.7% 
among Black, Hispanic, and White children, respectively. Overall, children with 
ASD and IQ scores ≤70 had earlier median ages of ASD diagnosis than children 
with ASD and IQ scores >70 (44 versus 53 months).
INTERPRETATION: In 2018, one in 44 children aged 8 years was estimated to have 
ASD, and prevalence and median age of identification varied widely across sites. 
Whereas overall ASD prevalence was similar by race and ethnicity, at certain 
sites Hispanic children were less likely to be identified as having ASD than 
White or Black children. The higher proportion of Black children compared with 
White and Hispanic children classified as having intellectual disability was 
consistent with previous findings.
PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION: The variability in ASD prevalence and community ASD 
identification practices among children with different racial, ethnic, and 
geographical characteristics highlights the importance of research into the 
causes of that variability and strategies to provide equitable access to 
developmental evaluations and services. These findings also underscore the need 
for enhanced infrastructure for diagnostic, treatment, and support services to 
meet the needs of all children.

BACKGROUND: Mobile apps for mental health are available on the market. Although 
they seem to be promising for improving the accessibility of mental health care, 
little is known about their acceptance, design methodology, evaluation, and 
integration into psychotherapy protocols. This makes it difficult for health 
care professionals to judge whether these apps may help them and their patients.
OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to describe and evaluate a protocol for the participatory 
design of mobile apps for mental health. In this study, participants and 
psychotherapists are engaged in the early phases of the design and development 
of the app empowered by conversational artificial intelligence (AI). The app 
supports interventions for stress management training based on cognitive 
behavioral theory.
METHODS: A total of 21 participants aged 33-61 years with mild to moderate 
levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (assessed by administering the Italian 
versions of the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised, Occupational Stress Indicator, and 
Perceived Stress Scale) were assigned randomly to 2 groups, A and B. Both groups 
received stress management training sessions along with cognitive behavioral 
treatment, but only participants assigned to group A received support through a 
mobile personal health care agent, designed for mental care and empowered by AI 
techniques. Psychopathological outcomes were assessed at baseline (T1), after 8 
weeks of treatment (T2), and 3 months after treatment (T3). Focus groups with 
psychotherapists who administered the therapy were held after treatment to 
collect their impressions and suggestions.
RESULTS: Although the intergroup statistical analysis showed that group B 
participants could rely on better coping strategies, group A participants 
reported significant improvements in obsessivity and compulsivity and positive 
distress symptom assessment. The psychotherapists' acceptance of the protocol 
was good. In particular, they were in favor of integrating an AI-based mental 
health app into their practice because they could appreciate the increased 
engagement of patients in pursuing their therapy goals.
CONCLUSIONS: The integration into practice of an AI-based mobile app for mental 
health was shown to be acceptable to both mental health professionals and users. 
Although it was not possible in this experiment to show that the integration of 
AI-based conversational technologies into traditional remote psychotherapy 
significantly decreased the participants' levels of stress and anxiety, the 
experimental results showed significant trends of reduction of symptoms in group 
A and their persistence over time. The mental health professionals involved in 
the experiment reported interest in, and acceptance of, the proposed technology 
as a promising tool to be included in a blended model of psychotherapy.

OBJECTIVE: Behavioral impairment occurs in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) 
and ALS-fronto-temporal dementia (ALS-FTD). It has been proposed that ALS 
patients without FTD retain an awareness of their behavioral impairment while 
ALS-FTD patients lose this awareness (referred to as retention vs. loss of 
"insight"). Loss of insight has not yet been studied across the entire ALS-FTD 
spectrum; our study addresses this gap by including patients with all the ALS 
cognitive-behavioral profiles.
METHODS: Eighty-three ALS patients (and their informants) took part in this 
bicentric study involving two German recruitment sites. Patients and informants 
completed the Frontal Systems Behavior Scale covering the domains of apathy, 
disinhibition, and executive dysfunctioning. Patients were classified into five 
groups according to the Strong and Rascovsky criteria: cognitively unimpaired 
(ALSni), cognitively impaired without dementia (ALSci), behaviorally impaired 
(ALSbi), a combination of behaviorally and cognitively impaired (ALScbi), and 
ALS-FTD. We applied Bayesian two-way ANOVA to test whether there were subgroup 
differences regarding insight into their behavioral decline.
RESULTS: All patient subgroups experienced behavioral decline (Bayes 
factor > 3). Only ALS-FTD patients lost insight into disinhibition and executive 
dysfunctioning. ALSbi patients exhibited worse insight than ALSni and ALSci 
patients (Bayes factor > 10). Evidence regarding the ALScbi patients was 
inconclusive. Higher IQ was associated with worse insight (Bayes factor > 3).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide solid support for the notion that ALS patients 
without dementia experience behavioral decline regardless of their 
cognitive-behavioral profile and retain different levels of insight into this 
decline. The inverse association of premorbid verbal intelligence with insight 
was unexpected, leaving room for further investigation.

OBJECTIVE: After radical prostatectomy (RP), one-third of patients will 
experience biochemical recurrence (BCR), which is associated with subsequent 
metastasis and cancer-specific mortality. We employed machine learning (ML) 
algorithms to predict BCR after RP, and compare them with traditional regression 
models and nomograms.
METHODS: Utilizing a prospective Uro-oncology registry, 18 clinicopathological 
parameters of 1130 consecutive patients who underwent RP (2009-2018) were 
recorded, yielding over 20,000 data points for analysis. The data set was split 
into a 70:30 ratio for training and validation. Three ML models: Naïve Bayes 
(NB), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) were studied, and 
compared with traditional regression models and nomograms (Kattan, CAPSURE, John 
Hopkins [JHH]) to predict BCR at 1, 3, and 5 years.
RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 70.0 months, 176 (15.6%) developed BCR, at a 
median time of 16.0 months (interquartile range [IQR]: 11.0-26.0). Multivariate 
analyses demonstrated strongest association of BCR with prostate-specific 
antigen (PSA) (p: 0.015), positive surgical margins (p < 0.001), extraprostatic 
extension (p: 0.002), seminal vesicle invasion (p: 0.004), and grade group 
(p < 0.001). The 3 ML models demonstrated good prediction of BCR at 1, 3, and 5 
years, with the area under curves (AUC) of NB at 0.894, 0.876, and 0.894, RF at 
0.846, 0.875, and 0.888, and SVM at 0.835, 0.850, and 0.855, respectively. All 
models demonstrated (1) robust accuracy (>0.82), (2) good calibration with 
minimal overfitting, (3) longitudinal consistency across the three time points, 
and (4) inter-model validity. The ML models were comparable to traditional 
regression analyses (AUC: 0.797, 0.848, and 0.862) and outperformed the three 
nomograms: Kattan (AUC: 0.815, 0.798, and 0.799), JHH (AUC: 0.820, 0.757, and 
0.750) and CAPSURE nomograms (AUC: 0.706, 0.720, and 0.749) (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Supervised ML algorithms can deliver accurate performances and 
outperform nomograms in predicting BCR after RP. This may facilitate tailored 
care provisions by identifying high-risk patients who will benefit from 
multimodal therapy.

Managing navigational safety is a key responsibility of coastal states. 
Predicting and measuring these risks has a high complexity due to their 
infrequent occurrence, multitude of causes, and large study areas. As a result, 
maritime risk models are generally limited in scale to small regions, 
generalized across diverse environments, or rely on the use of expert judgement. 
Therefore, such an approach has limited scalability and may incorrectly 
characterize the risk. Within this article a novel method for undertaking 
spatial modeling of maritime risk is proposed through machine learning. This 
enables navigational safety to be characterized while leveraging the significant 
volumes of relevant data available. The method comprises two key components: 
aggregation of historical accident data, vessel traffic, and other exploratory 
features into a spatial grid; and the implementation of several classification 
algorithms that predicts annual accident occurrence for various vessel types. 
This approach is applied to characterize the risk of collisions and groundings 
in the United Kingdom. The results vary between hazard types and vessel types 
but show remarkable capability at characterizing maritime risk, with accuracies 
and area under curve scores in excess of 90% in most implementations. 
Furthermore, the ensemble tree-based algorithms of XGBoost and Random Forest 
consistently outperformed other machine learning algorithms that were tested. 
The resultant potential risk maps provide decisionmakers with actionable 
intelligence in order to target risk mitigation measures in regions with the 
greatest requirement.

Artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) remains a hot topic in 
medicine. DL is a subcategory of machine learning that takes advantage of 
multiple layers of interconnected neurons capable of analyzing immense amounts 
of data and "learning" patterns and offering predictions. It appears to be 
poised to fundamentally transform and help advance the field of diagnostic 
radiology, as heralded by numerous published use cases and number of FDA-cleared 
products. On the other hand, while multiple publications have touched upon many 
great hypothetical use cases of AI in interventional radiology (IR), the actual 
implementation of AI in IR clinical practice has been slow compared with the 
diagnostic world. In this article, we set out to examine a few challenges 
contributing to this scarcity of AI applications in IR, including inherent 
specialty challenges, regulatory hurdles, intellectual property, raising 
capital, and ethics. Owing to the complexities involved in implementing AI in 
IR, it is likely that IR will be one of the late beneficiaries of AI. In the 
meantime, it would be worthwhile to continuously engage in defining clinically 
relevant use cases and focus our limited resources on those that would benefit 
our patients the most.

The practice of mathematics involves discovering patterns and using these to 
formulate and prove conjectures, resulting in theorems. Since the 1960s, 
mathematicians have used computers to assist in the discovery of patterns and 
formulation of conjectures1, most famously in the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer 
conjecture2, a Millennium Prize Problem3. Here we provide examples of new 
fundamental results in pure mathematics that have been discovered with the 
assistance of machine learning-demonstrating a method by which machine learning 
can aid mathematicians in discovering new conjectures and theorems. We propose a 
process of using machine learning to discover potential patterns and relations 
between mathematical objects, understanding them with attribution techniques and 
using these observations to guide intuition and propose conjectures. We outline 
this machine-learning-guided framework and demonstrate its successful 
application to current research questions in distinct areas of pure mathematics, 
in each case showing how it led to meaningful mathematical contributions on 
important open problems: a new connection between the algebraic and geometric 
structure of knots, and a candidate algorithm predicted by the combinatorial 
invariance conjecture for symmetric groups4. Our work may serve as a model for 
collaboration between the fields of mathematics and artificial intelligence (AI) 
that can achieve surprising results by leveraging the respective strengths of 
mathematicians and machine learning.

Abnormal torsion of the lower limbs may adversely affect joint health. This 
study developed and validated a deep learning-based method for automatic 
measurement of femoral and tibial torsion on MRI. Axial T2-weighted sequences 
acquired of the hips, knees, and ankles of 93 patients (mean age, 13 ± 5 years; 
52 males) were included and allocated to training (n = 60), validation (n = 9), 
and test sets (n = 24). A U-net convolutional neural network was trained to 
segment both femur and tibia, identify osseous anatomic landmarks, define 
pertinent reference lines, and quantify femoral and tibial torsion. Manual 
measurements by two radiologists provided the reference standard. Inter-reader 
comparisons were performed using repeated-measures ANOVA, Pearson's r, and the 
intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Mean Sørensen-Dice coefficients for 
segmentation accuracy ranged between 0.89 and 0.93 and erroneous segmentations 
were scarce. Ranges of torsion as measured by both readers and the algorithm on 
the same axial image were 15.8°-18.0° (femur) and 33.9°-35.2° (tibia). 
Correlation coefficients (ranges, .968 ≤ r ≤ .984 [femur]; .867 ≤ r ≤ .904 
[tibia]) and ICCs (ranges, .963 ≤ ICC ≤ .974 [femur]; .867 ≤ ICC ≤ .894 [tibia]) 
indicated excellent inter-reader agreement. Algorithm-based analysis was faster 
than manual analysis (7 vs 207 vs 230 s, p < .001). In conclusion, fully 
automatic measurement of torsional alignment is accurate, reliable, and 
sufficiently fast for clinical workflows.

SARS-CoV2 pandemic exposed the limitations of artificial intelligence based 
medical imaging systems. Earlier in the pandemic, the absence of sufficient 
training data prevented effective deep learning (DL) solutions for the diagnosis 
of COVID-19 based on X-Ray data. Here, addressing the lacunae in existing 
literature and algorithms with the paucity of initial training data; we describe 
CovBaseAI, an explainable tool using an ensemble of three DL models and an 
expert decision system (EDS) for COVID-Pneumonia diagnosis, trained entirely on 
pre-COVID-19 datasets. The performance and explainability of CovBaseAI was 
primarily validated on two independent datasets. Firstly, 1401 randomly selected 
CxR from an Indian quarantine center to assess effectiveness in excluding 
radiological COVID-Pneumonia requiring higher care. Second, curated dataset; 434 
RT-PCR positive cases and 471 non-COVID/Normal historical scans, to assess 
performance in advanced medical settings. CovBaseAI had an accuracy of 87% with 
a negative predictive value of 98% in the quarantine-center data. However, 
sensitivity was 0.66-0.90 taking RT-PCR/radiologist opinion as ground truth. 
This work provides new insights on the usage of EDS with DL methods and the 
ability of algorithms to confidently predict COVID-Pneumonia while reinforcing 
the established learning; that benchmarking based on RT-PCR may not serve as 
reliable ground truth in radiological diagnosis. Such tools can pave the path 
for multi-modal high throughput detection of COVID-Pneumonia in screening and 
referral.

Profound advances in computational methods, including artificial intelligence 
(AI), present the opportunity to use the exponentially growing volume and 
complexity of available cancer measurements toward data-driven personalized 
care. While exciting, this opportunity has highlighted the disconnect between 
the promise of compute and the supply of high-quality data. The current paradigm 
of ad-hoc aggregation and curation of data needs to be replaced with a "metadata 
supply chain" that provides robust data in context with known provenance, that 
is, lineage and comprehensive data governance that will allow the promise of AI 
technology to be realized to its full potential in clinical practice.

INTRODUCTION: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) continues to present major 
challenges to modern healthcare. Recent advances in whole-genome sequencing 
(WGS) have made the rapid molecular characterization of AMR a realistic 
possibility for diagnostic laboratories; yet major barriers to clinical 
implementation exist.
AREAS COVERED: We describe and compare short- and long-read sequencing 
platforms, typical components of bioinformatics pipelines, tools for AMR gene 
detection and the relative merits of read- or assembly-based approaches. The 
challenges of characterizing mobile genetic elements from genomic data are 
outlined, as well as the complexities inherent to the prediction of phenotypic 
resistance from WGS. Practical obstacles to implementation in diagnostic 
laboratories, the critical role of quality control and external quality 
assurance, as well as standardized reporting standards are also discussed. 
Future directions, such as the application of machine-learning and artificial 
intelligence algorithms, linked to clinically meaningful outcomes, may offer a 
new paradigm for the clinical application of AMR prediction.
EXPERT OPINION: AMR prediction from WGS data presents an exciting opportunity to 
advance our capacity to comprehensively characterize infectious pathogens in a 
rapid manner, ultimately aiming to improve patient outcomes. Collaborative 
efforts between clinicians, scientists, regulatory bodies and healthcare 
administrators will be critical to achieve the full promise of this approach.

The Covid-19 pandemic accelerated research and development not only in 
infectious diseases but also in digital technologies to improve monitoring, 
forecasting, and intervening on planetary and ecological risks. In the European 
Commission, the Destination Earth (DestinE) is a current major initiative to 
develop a digital model of the Earth (a "digital twin") with high precision. 
Moreover, omics systems science is undergoing digital transformation impacting 
nearly all dimensions of the field, including real-time phenotype capture to 
data analytics using machine learning and artificial intelligence, to name but a 
few emerging frontiers. We discuss the ways in which the current ongoing digital 
transformation in omics offers synergies with digital twins/DestinE. 
Importantly, we note here the rise of a new field of scholarship, planetary 
health genomics. We conclude that digital transformation in public and private 
sectors, digital twins/DestinE, and their convergence with omics systems science 
are poised to build robust capacities for pandemic preparedness and resilient 
societies in the 21st century.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether deep learning 
reconstruction (DLR) improves the image quality of intracranial magnetic 
resonance angiography (MRA) at 1.5 T.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, MRA images of 40 patients 
(21 males and 19 females; mean age, 65.8 ± 13.2 years) were reconstructed with 
and without the DLR technique (DLR image and non-DLR image, respectively). 
Quantitative image analysis was performed by placing regions of interest on the 
basilar artery and cerebrospinal fluid in the prepontine cistern. We calculated 
the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) for analyses 
of the basilar artery. Two experienced radiologists evaluated the depiction of 
structures (the right internal carotid artery, right ophthalmic artery, basilar 
artery, and right superior cerebellar artery), artifacts, subjective noise and 
overall image quality in a qualitative image analysis. Scores were compared in 
the quantitative and qualitative image analyses between the DLR and non-DLR 
images using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests.
RESULTS: The SNR and CNR for the basilar artery were significantly higher for 
the DLR images than for the non-DLR images (p < 0.001). Qualitative image 
analysis scores (p < 0.003 and p < 0.005 for readers 1 and 2, respectively), 
excluding those for artifacts (p = 0.072-0.565), were also significantly higher 
for the DLR images than for the non-DLR images.
CONCLUSION: DLR enables the production of higher quality 1.5 T intracranial MRA 
images with improved visualization of arteries.

OBJECTIVE: This long-term retrospective follow-up study aimed to address the 
knowledge gap between prenatal diagnosis of complete isolated Agenesis of Corpus 
Callosum (cACC) at fetal MRI and postnatal neurodevelopmental outcome to improve 
prenatal counseling for parents.
METHODS: Data on fetuses with isolated cACC from a single-center MRI database 
built up in two decades were considered. Detailed postnatal clinical, 
neuropsychological evaluations were performed and descriptions of available 
neuroradiological and genetic data were provided.
RESULTS: Following a detailed neuropsychological evaluation and a long-term 
follow-up, the subsequent results emerged: 38 school-aged children (older than 
6 years) of 50 (aged 2.5-15 years) showed normal intellectual functions (50%), 
intellectual disability (21%), and borderline intelligence quotient (29%). 
Deficits in motor functions (58%), executive functions (37%), language (61%), 
memory abilities (58%), and academic performances (53%) were found. Twenty-one 
percent of participants showed behavioral difficulties. Almost half of the 
participants underwent rehabilitation. Additional findings (21%) were detected 
at postnatal brain MRI, and a significant association between additional 
findings at postnatal imaging and abnormal neurodevelopmental outcome was 
observed.
INTERPRETATIONS: This study supports the view that children with prenatal 
diagnosis of isolated cACC may present with several degrees of neurologic and 
neuropsychological impairment which become more evident only in their second 
decade of life. Postnatal MRI and detailed genetic analysis may add crucial 
information to prenatal data and substantially influence final judgment on the 
outcome and orient clinical management and counseling.

COVID-19 is mainly considered an "adult pandemic," but it also has strong 
implications for children and consequently for pediatric anesthesia. Despite the 
lethality of SARS-CoV-2 infection being directly correlated with age, children 
have equally experienced the negative impacts of this pandemic. In fact, the 
spectrum of COVID-19 symptoms among children ranges from very mild to those 
resembling adults, but may also present as a multisystemic inflammatory 
syndrome. Moreover, the vast majority of children might be affected by 
asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic infection making them the "perfect" carriers 
for spreading the disease in the community. Beyond the clinical manifestations 
of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the COVID-19 pandemic may ultimately have catastrophic 
health and socioeconomic consequences for children and adolescents, which are 
yet to be defined. The aim of this narrative review is to highlight how COVID-19 
pandemic has affected and changed the pediatric anesthesia practice and which 
lessons are to be learned in case of a future "pandemic." In particular, the 
rapid evolution and dissemination of research and clinical findings have forced 
the scientific community to adapt and alter clinical practice on an unseen and 
pragmatic manner. Equally, implementation of new platforms, techniques, and 
devices together with artificial intelligence and large-scale collaborative 
efforts may present a giant step for mankind. The valuable lessons of this 
pandemic will ultimately translate into new treatments modalities for various 
diseases but will also have the potential for safety improvement and better 
quality of care. However, this pandemic has revealed the vulnerability and 
deficiencies of our health-care system. If not addressed properly, we may end up 
with a tsunami of burnout and compassionate fatigue among health-care 
professionals. Pediatric anesthesia and critical care staff are no exceptions.

BACKGROUND: Early and accurate radiographic diagnosis is required for the 
management of children with radio-opaque esophageal foreign bodies. Button 
batteries are some of the most dangerous esophageal foreign bodies and coins are 
among the most common. We hypothesized that artificial intelligence could be 
used to triage radiographs with esophageal button batteries and coins.
OBJECTIVE: Our primary objective was to train an object detector to detect 
esophageal foreign bodies, whether button battery or coin. Our secondary 
objective was to train an image classifier to classify the detected foreign body 
as either a button battery or a coin.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We trained an object detector to detect button batteries 
and coins. The training data set for the object detector was 57 radiographs, 
consisting of 3 groups of 19 images each with either an esophageal button 
battery, esophageal coin or no foreign body. The foreign bodies were 
endoscopically confirmed, and the groups were age and gender matched. We then 
trained an image classifier to classify the detected foreign body as either a 
button battery or a coin. The training data set for the image classifier 
consisted of 19 radiographs of button batteries and 19 of coins, cropped from 
the object detector training data set. The object detector and image classifier 
were then tested on 103 radiographs with an esophageal foreign body, and 103 
radiographs without a foreign body.
RESULTS: The object detector was 100% sensitive and specific for detecting an 
esophageal foreign body. The image classifier accurately classified all 6/6 
(100%) button batteries in the testing data set and 93/95 (97.9%) of the coins. 
The remaining two coins were incorrectly classified as button batteries. In 
addition to these images with a single button battery or coin, there were two 
unique cases in the testing data set: a stacked button battery and coin, and two 
stacked coins, both of which were classified as coins.
CONCLUSION: Artificial intelligence models show promise in detecting and 
classifying esophageal discoid foreign bodies and could potentially be used to 
triage radiographs for radiologist interpretation.

BACKGROUND: According to international transgender care guidelines, an important 
prerequisite for puberty suppression (PS) is transgender adolescents' competence 
to give informed consent (IC). In society, there is doubt whether transgender 
adolescents are capable of this, which in some countries has even led to limited 
access to this intervention. Therefore, this study examined transgender 
adolescents' medical decision-making competence (MDC) to give IC for starting PS 
in a structured, replicable way. Additionally, potential associated variables on 
MDC, such as age, intelligence, sex, psychological functioning, were 
investigated.
METHODS: A cross-sectional semistructured interview study with 74 transgender 
adolescents (aged 10-18 years; 16 birth-assigned boys, 58 birth-assigned girls) 
within two Dutch specialized gender-identity clinics was performed. To assess 
MDC, judgements based on the reference standard (clinical assessment) and the 
MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool for Treatment (MacCAT-T), a validated 
semistructured interview, were used.
RESULTS: Of the transgender adolescents, 93.2% (reference standard judgements; 
69 of 74) and 89.2% (MacCAT-T judgements; 66 of 74) were assessed competent to 
consent. Intermethod agreement was 87.8% (65 of 74). Interrater agreements of 
the reference standard and MacCAT-T-based judgements were 89.2% (198 of 222) and 
86.5% (192 of 222), respectively. IQ and sex were both significantly related to 
MacCAT-T total score, whereas age, level of emotional and behavioral challenges, 
and diagnostic trajectories duration were not.
CONCLUSIONS: By using the MacCAT-T and clinicians' assessments, 93.2% and 89.2%, 
respectively, of the transgender adolescents in this study were assessed 
competent to consent for starting PS.

Aerogel materials with super-insulating, visual-penetrable, and sound-proof 
properties are promising in buildings, whereas the coupling effect of various 
parameters in complex porous aerogels proposes challenges for thermal/visual 
performance prediction. Traditional physics-based models face challenges such as 
modeling complexity, heavy computational load, and inadaptability for long-term 
validation (owing to boundary condition change, degradation of thermophysical 
properties, and so on). In this study, a holistic review is conducted on aerogel 
production, components prefabrication, modeling development, single-, and 
multi-objective optimizations. Methodologies to quantify parameter uncertainties 
are reviewed, including interface energy balance, Rosseland approximation and 
Monte Carlo method. Novel aerogel integrated glazing systems with synergistic 
functions are demonstrated. Originalities include an innovative modeling 
approach, enhanced computational efficiency, and user-friendly interface for 
non-professionals or multidisciplinary research. In addition, human 
knowledge-based machine learning can reduce abundant data requirement, increase 
performance prediction reliability, and improve model interpretability, so as to 
promote advanced aerogel materials in smart and energy-efficient buildings.

Leukemia is usually diagnosed by viewing the smears of blood and bone marrow 
using microscopes and complex Cytochemical tests can be used to authorize and 
classify leukemia. But these methods are costly, slow and affected by the 
proficiency and expertise of the specialists concerned. Leukemia can be detected 
with the help of image processing-based methods by analyzing microscopic smear 
images to detect the presence of leukemic cells and such techniques are simple, 
fast, cheap and not biased by the specialists. The proposed study presents a 
computer aided diagnosis system that uses pretrained deep Convolutional Neural 
Networks (CNNs) for detection of leukemia images against normal images. The use 
of pretrained networks is comparatively an easy method of applying deep learning 
for image analysis and the comparison results of the present study can be used 
to choose appropriate networks for diagnostic tasks. The microscopic images used 
in the proposed work were downloaded from a public dataset ALL-IDB. In the 
proposed work, image classification is done without using any image segregation 
and feature extraction practices and the study used pretrained series network 
AlexNet, VGG-16, VGG-19, Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) networks GoogLeNet, 
Inceptionv3, MobileNet-v2, Xception, DenseNet-201, Inception-ResNet-v2 and 
residual networks ResNet-18, ResNet-50 and ResNet-101 for performing the 
classification and comparison. A classification accuracy of 100% is obtained 
with all the pretrained networks used in the study for ALL_IDB1 dataset and for 
ALL_IDB2 dataset, 100% accuracy is obtained with all networks except the AlexNet 
and VGG-16. The efficacy of three optimization algorithms Stochastic Gradient 
Descent with Momentum (SGDM), Root Mean Square propagation (RMSprop) and 
Adaptive Moment estimation (ADAM) is also compared in all the classifications 
performed. The study considered the detection of leukemia in general only, and 
classification of leukemia into different types can be attempted as a future 
work.

There is increasing popularity in the use of artificial intelligence and 
machine-learning techniques to provide diagnostic and prognostic models for 
various aspects of Trauma & Orthopaedic surgery. However, correct interpretation 
of these models is difficult for those without specific knowledge of computing 
or health data science methodology. Lack of current reporting standards leads to 
the potential for significant heterogeneity in the design and quality of 
published studies. We provide an overview of machine-learning techniques for the 
lay individual, including key terminology and best practice reporting 
guidelines. Cite this article: Bone Joint J 2021;103-B(12):1754-1758.

Aging is a universal feature of life and a complex process at all levels from 
the biological to the societal. What constitutes older age is subjective and 
flexible, and how one defines older age is influenced by everchanging 
individual, generational, and cultural expectations. As the global population 
ages at an unprecedented rate, we are increasingly confronted with a myriad of 
challenges associated with aging, including increased healthcare needs and the 
far-reaching negative consequences of individual and structural agism. However, 
the shift in world demographics toward an older population is not a growing 
burden, but an opportunity to reshape our view of older life and proactively 
embrace healthy aging. Indeed, a healthy person is not defined by the absence of 
illness, but by the potential for meaningful work, positive relationships, and 
longevity. Simple preventive measures, such as improved diet and increased 
exercise, can enhance overall health and quality of life, and growing evidence 
highlights the potential of positive psychology for improving psychological 
well-being and overall quality of life. Now more than ever, technological 
innovation including artificial intelligence can be leveraged to improve our 
understanding of the causes and consequences of aging, as well as the most 
effective interventions to enhance resilience and extend healthy longevity. Good 
health is our greatest asset. It is the responsibility of all-individuals, 
society, business, science, healthcare systems, and government-to ensure that 
everyone is well equipped to maintain good health. Together, we can all live 
better, longer.

All living systems perpetuate themselves via growth in or on the body, followed 
by splitting, budding, or birth. We find that synthetic multicellular assemblies 
can also replicate kinematically by moving and compressing dissociated cells in 
their environment into functional self-copies. This form of perpetuation, 
previously unseen in any organism, arises spontaneously over days rather than 
evolving over millennia. We also show how artificial intelligence methods can 
design assemblies that postpone loss of replicative ability and perform useful 
work as a side effect of replication. This suggests other unique and useful 
phenotypes can be rapidly reached from wild-type organisms without selection or 
genetic engineering, thereby broadening our understanding of the conditions 
under which replication arises, phenotypic plasticity, and how useful 
replicative machines may be realized.

BACKGROUND: Research with adults suggests that executive function (EF) might 
play a role in the development of divergent thinking, a key component of 
creativity, by helping children override canonical knowledge.
PROCEDURE: We examined this possibility in two experiments, by manipulating the 
familiarity of objects used in the Alternate Uses test of divergent thinking 
both between-participants (Experiment 1: N = 53 4-year-olds and 50 6-year-olds) 
and within-participants (Experiment 2: N = 74 5-year-olds).
FINDINGS: We found evidence that younger children generated more and/or more 
original ideas for novel than familiar objects. However, this effect disappeared 
with age and did not depend on child EF. Further, EF was inversely associated 
with divergent thinking, controlling for age, intelligence, and income.
SIGNIFICANCE: These results call into question a simple executive account of 
children's divergent thinking and suggest that, among predominantly White, 
socioeconomically advantaged 4-6-year-olds, divergent idea-generation might be a 
primarily bottom-up process that can be hindered by top-down thinking.

INTRODUCTION: The complex pathophysiology of autoimmune diseases (AIDs) is being 
progressively deciphered, providing evidence for a multiplicity of 
pro-inflammatory pathways underlying heterogeneous clinical phenotypes and 
disease evolution.
AREAS COVERED: Treatment strategies involving drug combinations are emerging as 
a preferred option to achieve remission in a vast majority of patients affected 
by systemic AIDs. The design of appropriate drug combinations can benefit from 
AID modeling following a comprehensive multi-omics molecular profiling of 
patients combined with Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered computational 
analyses. Such disease models support patient stratification in homogeneous 
subgroups, shed light on dysregulated pro-inflammatory pathways and yield 
hypotheses regarding potential therapeutic targets and candidate biomarkers to 
stratify and monitor patients during treatment. AID models inform the rational 
design of combination therapies interfering with independent pro-inflammatory 
pathways related to either one of five prominent immune compartments 
contributing to the pathophysiology of AIDs, i.e. pro-inflammatory signals 
originating from tissues, innate immune mechanisms, T lymphocyte activation, 
autoantibodies and B cell activation, as well as soluble mediators involved in 
immune cross-talk.
EXPERT OPINION: The optimal management of AIDs in the future will rely upon 
rationally designed combination therapies, as a modality of a model-based 
Computational Precision Medicine taking into account the patients' biological 
and clinical specificities.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the accuracy of cephalometric landmark identification 
between artificial intelligence (AI) deep learning convolutional neural networks 
(CNN) You Only Look Once, Version 3 (YOLOv3) algorithm and the manually traced 
(MT) group.
SETTING AND SAMPLE POPULATION: The American Association of Orthodontists 
Federation (AAOF) Legacy Denver collection was used to obtain 110 cephalometric 
images for this study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Lateral cephalograms were digitized and traced by a 
calibrated senior orthodontic resident using Dolphin Imaging. The same images 
were uploaded to AI software Ceppro DDH Inc The Cartesian system of coordinates 
with Sella as the reference landmark was used to extract x- and y-coordinates 
for 16 cephalometric points: Nasion (Na), A point, B point, Menton (Me), Gonion 
(Go), Upper incisor tip, Lower incisor tip, Upper incisor apex, Lower incisor 
apex, Anterior Nasal Spine (ANS), Posterior Nasal Spine (PNS), Pogonion (Pg), 
Pterigomaxillary fissure point (Pt), Basion (Ba), Articulare (Art) and Orbitale 
(Or). The mean distances were assessed relative to the reference value of 2 mm. 
Student paired t-tests at significance level of P < .05 were used to compare the 
mean differences in each of the x- and y-components. SPSS (IBM-vs. 27.0) 
software was used for the data analysis.
RESULTS: There was no statistical difference for 12 out of 16 points when 
analysing absolute differences between MT and AI groups.
CONCLUSION: AI may increase efficiency without compromising accuracy with 
cephalometric tracings in routine clinical practice and in research settings.

BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has caused a worldwide pandemic, making the early detection 
of the virus crucial. We present an approach for the determination of COVID-19 
infection based on breath analysis.
METHODS: A high sensitivity mass spectrometer was combined with artificial 
intelligence and used to develop a method for the identification of COVID-19 in 
human breath within seconds. A set of 1137 positive and negative subjects from 
different age groups, collected in two periods from two hospitals in the USA, 
from 26 August, 2020 until 15 September, 2020 and from 11 September, 2020 until 
11 November, 2020, was used for the method development. The subjects exhaled in 
a Tedlar bag, and the exhaled breath samples were subsequently analyzed using a 
Proton Transfer Reaction Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer (PTR-ToF-MS). The 
produced mass spectra were introduced to a series of machine learning models. 
70% of the data was used for these sub-models' training and 30% was used for 
testing.
FINDINGS: A set of 340 samples, 95 positives and 245 negatives, was used for the 
testing. The combined models successfully predicted 77 out of the 95 samples as 
positives and 199 out of the 245 samples as negatives. The overall accuracy of 
the model was 81.2%. Since over 50% of the total positive samples belonged to 
the age group of over 55 years old, the performance of the model in this 
category was also separately evaluated on 339 subjects (170 negative and 169 
positive). The model correctly identified 166 out of the 170 negatives and 164 
out of the 169 positives. The model accuracy in this case was 97.3%.
INTERPRETATION: The results showed that this method for the identification of 
COVID-19 infection is a promising tool, which can give fast and accurate 
results.

BACKGROUND: Cognitive functioning in epileptic syndromes has been widely 
explored in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), but few studies have 
investigated the neuropsychological profile in posterior cortex epilepsy (PCE). 
In this study, we investigated the presurgical intellectual profile of children 
and adolescents with drug-resistant PCE.
METHODS: Children and adolescents diagnosed with PCE (n = 25) participated in 
this study. The data were obtained from medical records, with assessments 
carried out between the years 2003 and 2019. To compare the intellectual 
profile, we also included patients diagnosed with frontal (n = 26) and temporal 
lobe epilepsy (n = 40). The Wechsler Intelligence Scales were used for the 
assessment of general intelligence.
RESULTS: There was an effect of the brain region on the Working Memory Index 
(p < 0.01), in which patients with TLE had significantly higher scores than 
groups with FLE (p < 0.01) and PCE (p < 0.05). We also demonstrated that 
patients with PCE tended to perform worse in the Processing Speed Index than 
patients with TLE (p = 0.055). The Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient, Verbal 
Comprehension, and Perceptual Reasoning indexes did not differ among the brain 
regions.
CONCLUSIONS: Children and adolescents with PCE demonstrated significant 
impairment in working memory and processing speed. The pattern of cognitive 
dysfunction in PCE was similar to that observed in FLE, which expands the 
evidence of the involvement of frontoparietal networks on cognitive proficiency.

PURPOSE: A growing number of studies have examined whether Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) systems can support imaging-based diagnosis of COVID-19-caused 
pneumonia, including both gains in diagnostic performance and speed. However, 
what is currently missing is a combined appreciation of studies comparing human 
readers and AI.
METHODS: We followed PRISMA-DTA guidelines for our systematic review, searching 
EMBASE, PUBMED and Scopus databases. To gain insights into the potential value 
of AI methods, we focused on studies comparing the performance of human readers 
versus AI models or versus AI-supported human readings.
RESULTS: Our search identified 1270 studies, of which 12 fulfilled specific 
selection criteria. Concerning diagnostic performance, in testing datasets 
reported sensitivity was 42-100% (human readers, n = 9 studies), 60-95% (AI 
systems, n = 10) and 81-98% (AI-supported readers, n = 3), whilst reported 
specificity was 26-100% (human readers, n = 8), 61-96% (AI systems, n = 10) and 
78-99% (AI-supported readings, n = 2). One study highlighted the potential of 
AI-supported readings for the assessment of lung lesion burden changes, whilst 
two studies indicated potential time savings for detection with AI.
CONCLUSIONS: Our review indicates that AI systems or AI-supported human readings 
show less performance variability (interquartile range) in general, and may 
support the differentiation of COVID-19 pneumonia from other forms of pneumonia 
when used in high-prevalence and symptomatic populations. However, 
inconsistencies related to study design, reporting of data, areas of risk of 
bias, as well as limitations of statistical analyses complicate clear 
conclusions. We therefore support efforts for developing critical elements of 
study design when assessing the value of AI for diagnostic imaging.

PURPOSE: The currently available indicators-sensitivity and specificity of 
expert radiological evaluation of MRIs-to identify mesial temporal lobe epilepsy 
(MTLE) associated with hippocampal sclerosis (HS) are deficient, as they cannot 
be easily assessed. We developed and investigated the use of a novel 
convolutional neural network trained on preoperative MRIs to aid diagnosis of 
these conditions.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We enrolled 141 individuals: 85 with clinically diagnosed 
mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) and hippocampal sclerosis International 
League Against Epilepsy (HS ILAE) type 1 who had undergone anterior temporal 
lobe hippocampectomy were assigned to the MTLE-HS group, and 56 epilepsy clinic 
outpatients diagnosed as nonepileptic were assigned to the normal group. We 
fine-tuned a modified CNN (mCNN) to classify the fully connected layers of 
ImageNet-pretrained VGG16 network models into the MTLE-HS and control groups. 
MTLE-HS was diagnosed using MRI both by the fine-tuned mCNN and epilepsy 
specialists. Their performances were compared.
RESULTS: The fine-tuned mCNN achieved excellent diagnostic performance, 
including 91.1% [85%, 96%] mean sensitivity and 83.5% [75%, 91%] mean 
specificity. The area under the resulting receiver operating characteristic 
curve was 0.94 [0.90, 0.98] (DeLong's method). Expert interpretation of the same 
image data achieved a mean sensitivity of 73.1% [65%, 82%] and specificity of 
66.3% [50%, 82%]. These confidence intervals were located entirely under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve of the fine-tuned mCNN.
CONCLUSIONS: Deep learning-based diagnosis of MTLE-HS from preoperative MR 
images using our fine-tuned mCNN achieved a performance superior to the visual 
interpretation by epilepsy specialists. Our model could serve as a useful 
preoperative diagnostic tool for ascertaining hippocampal atrophy in patients 
with MTLE.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the risk category performance of artificial 
intelligence-based coronary artery calcium score (AI-CACS) software used in 
non-gated chest computed tomography (CT) on three types of CT machines, 
considering the manual method as the standard.
METHODS: A total of 901 patients who underwent both chest CT and 
electrocardiogram (ECG)-gated non-contrast-enhanced cardiac CT with the same 
equipment within a 3-month period were enrolled in the study. AI-CACS software 
was based on a deep learning algorithm and was trained on multi-vendor, 
multi-scanner, and multi-hospital anonymized data from the chest CT database. 
The AI-CACS was automatically obtained from chest CT data by the AI-CACS 
software, while the manual CACS was obtained from cardiac CT data by the manual 
method. The correlation of the AI-CACS and manual CACS, concordance rate and 
kappa value of the risk categories determined by the two methods were 
calculated. The chi-square test was used to evaluate the differences in risk 
categories among the three types of CT machines from different manufacturers. 
The risk category performance of the AI-CACS for dichotomous risk categories 
bounded by 0, 100 and 400 was assessed.
RESULTS: The correlation of the AI-CACS with the manual CACS was ρ = 0.893 
(p < 0.001). The Bland-Altman plot (AI-CACS minus manual CACS) showed a mean 
difference of -27.2 and 95% limits of agreement of -290.0 to 235.6. The 
agreement of risk categories for the CACS was kappa (κ) = 0.679 (p < 0.001), and 
the concordance rate was 80.6%. The risk categories determined by the AI-CACS 
software on three types of CT machines were not significantly different 
(p = 0.7543). As dichotomous risk categories bounded by 0, 100 and 400, the 
accuracy, kappa value, and area under the curve of the AI-CACS were 88.6% vs. 
92.9% vs. 97.9%, 0.77 vs. 0.77 vs. 0.83, and 0.885 vs. 0.964 vs. 0.981, 
respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: There was good correlation and agreement between the AI-CACS and 
manual CACS in terms of the risk category. It is feasible to obtain the CACS 
using AI software based on non-gated chest CT data in a short time without 
increasing the radiation dose or economic burden. The AI-CACS software algorithm 
has good clinical universality and can be applied to CT machines from different 
manufacturers.

Noise reduction profile: A new method for evaluation of noise reduction 
techniques in CT.

Texas, Houston, Texas, USA.

PURPOSE: Noise power spectrum (NPS) is a commonly used performance metric to 
evaluate noise-reduction techniques (NRT) in imaging systems. The images 
reconstructed with and without an NRT can be compared via their NPS to better 
understand the NRT's effects on image noise. However, when comparing NPSs, 
simple visual assessments or a comparison of NPS peaks or medians are often 
used. These assessments make it difficult to objectively evaluate the effect of 
noise reduction across all spatial frequencies. In this work, we propose a new 
noise reduction profile (NRP) to facilitate a more complete and objective 
evaluation of NPSs for a range of NRTs used specifically in computed tomography 
(CT).
METHODS AND MATERIALS: The homogeneous section of the ACR or Catphan phantoms 
was scanned on different CT scanners equipped with the following NRTs: AIDR3D, 
AiCE, ASiR, ASiR-V, TrueFidelity, iDose, SAFIRE, and ADMIRE. The images were 
then reconstructed with all strengths of each NRT in reference to the baseline 
filtered back projection (FBP) images. One set of the baseline FBP images was 
also processed with PixelShine, an NRT based on artificial intelligence. The 
NPSs of the images before and after noise reduction were calculated in both the 
xy-plane and along the z-direction. The difference in the logarithmic scale 
between each NPS (baseline FBP and NRT) was then calculated and deemed the NRP. 
Furthermore, the relationship between the NRP and NPS peak positions was 
mathematically analyzed.
RESULTS: Each NRT has its own unique NRP. By comparing the NPS and NRP for each 
NRT, it was found that NRP is related to the peak shift of NPS. Additionally, 
under the assumption that the NPS has one peak and is differentiable, a 
relationship was mathematically derived between the slope of the NRP at the peak 
position of the NPS before noise reduction and the shift of the NPS peak 
position after noise reduction.
CONCLUSIONS: A new metric, NRP, was proposed based on NPS to objectively 
evaluate and compare methods for noise reduction in CT. The NRP can be used to 
compare the effects of various NRTs on image noise in both the xy-plane and 
z-direction. It also enables unbiased assessment of the detailed noise reduction 
properties of each NRT over all relevant spatial frequencies.

Dentistry, Seoul, South Korea.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to develop a fully automated human identification 
method based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a large-scale dental 
panoramic radiograph (DPR) data set.
METHODS: In total, 2760 DPRs from 746 subjects who had 2-17 DPRs with various 
changes in image characteristics due to various dental treatments (tooth 
extraction, oral surgery, prosthetics, orthodontics, or tooth development) were 
collected. The test data set included the latest DPR of each subject (746 
images) and the other DPRs (2014 images) were used for model training. A 
modified VGG16 model with two fully connected layers was applied for human 
identification. The proposed model was evaluated with rank-1, -3, and -5 
accuracies, running time, and gradient-weighted class activation mapping 
(Grad-CAM)-applied images.
RESULTS: This model had rank-1, -3, and -5 accuracies of 82.84%, 89.14%, and 
92.23%, respectively. All rank-1 accuracy values of the proposed model were 
above 80% regardless of changes in image characteristics. The average running 
time to train the proposed model was 60.9 s per epoch, and the prediction time 
for 746 test DPRs was short (3.2 s/image). The Grad-CAM technique verified that 
the model automatically identified humans by focusing on identifiable dental 
information.
CONCLUSION: The proposed model showed good performance in fully automatic human 
identification despite differing image characteristics of DPRs acquired from the 
same patients. Our model is expected to assist in the fast and accurate 
identification by experts by comparing large amounts of images and proposing 
identification candidates at high speed.

Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is an increasingly common therapy for a large range 
of neurological disorders, such as abnormal movement disorders. The 
effectiveness of DBS in terms of controlling patient symptomatology has made 
this procedure increasingly used over the past few decades. Concurrently, the 
popularity of Machine Learning (ML), a subfield of artificial intelligence, has 
skyrocketed and its influence has more recently extended to medical domains such 
as neurosurgery. Despite its growing research interest, there has yet to be a 
literature review specifically on the use of ML in DBS. We have followed a fully 
systematic methodology to obtain a corpus of 73 papers. In each paper, we 
identified the clinical application, the type/amount of data used, the method 
employed, and the validation strategy, further decomposed into 12 different 
sub-categories. The papers overall illustrated some existing trends in how ML is 
used in the context of DBS, including the breath of the problem domain and 
evolving techniques, as well as common frameworks and limitations. This 
systematic review analyzes at a broad level how ML have been recently used to 
address clinical problems on DBS, giving insight into how these new 
computational methods are helping to push the state-of-the-art of functional 
neurosurgery. DBS clinical workflow is complex, involves many specialists, and 
raises several clinical issues which have partly been addressed with artificial 
intelligence. However, several areas remain and those that have been recently 
addressed with ML are by no means considered "solved" by the community nor are 
they closed to new and evolving methods.

Dopamine, Cognitive Flexibility, and IQ: Epistatic 
Catechol-O-MethylTransferase:DRD2 Gene-Gene Interactions Modulate Mental 
Rigidity.

    J Cogn Neurosci. 2023 Nov 1;35(11):1898.

Cognitive flexibility has been hypothesized to be neurochemically rooted in 
dopamine neurotransmission. Nonetheless, underpowered sample sizes and 
contradictory meta-analytic findings have obscured the role of dopamine genes in 
cognitive flexibility and neglected potential gene-gene interactions. In this 
largest neurocognitive-genetic study to date (n = 1400), single nucleotide 
polymorphisms associated with elevated prefrontal dopamine levels 
(catechol-O-methyltransferase; rs4680) and diminished striatal dopamine (C957T; 
rs6277) were both implicated in Wisconsin Card Sorting Test performance. 
Crucially, however, these genetic effects were only evident in low-IQ 
participants, suggesting high intelligence compensates for, and eliminates, the 
effect of dispositional dopamine functioning on flexibility. This interaction 
between cognitive systems may explain and resolve previous empirical 
inconsistencies in highly educated participant samples. Moreover, compensatory 
gene-gene interactions were discovered between catechol-O-methyltransferase and 
DRD2, such that genotypes conferring either elevated prefrontal dopamine or 
diminished striatal dopamine-via heightened striatally concentrated D2 dopamine 
receptor availability-are sufficient for cognitive flexibility, but neither is 
necessary. The study has therefore revealed a form of epistatic redundancy or 
substitutability among dopamine systems in shaping adaptable thought and action, 
thus defining boundary conditions for dopaminergic effects on flexible behavior. 
These results inform theories of clinical disorders and psychopharmacological 
interventions and uncover complex fronto-striatal synergies in human flexible 
cognition.

PURPOSE: To investigate emotional intelligence (EI) development in physician 
assistant (PA) students as they progress through their didactic education.
METHODS: Data were gathered through an online survey of EI distributed to a 
purposeful sample of 5 institutions with similar curriculum length and start 
dates. Program directors forwarded the survey to students at the start of their 
didactic education (pretest). Follow-up surveys were distributed via email to 
the students at the end of their didactic education (posttest). The survey 
consisted of 33 items related to 4 subscales of EI. Participants' age, gender, 
and previous healthcare experience were gathered. Five repeated measures ANOVAs 
were calculated for each EI summary score. Independent sample t-tests were 
conducted between pretest scores and a previously established EI mean.
RESULTS: A total of 192 first-year students were solicited. A sample of 68 (16 
males; 52 females) served as participants. No results were attained for gender 
or age due to unbalanced sample sizes. Significant results were realized for 
total EI and the Managing Others' Emotions subscale.
CONCLUSION: Participants with more than one healthcare experience demonstrated 
significantly high emotional intelligence on the pretest. Participants with one 
healthcare experience demonstrated a significant increase in total EI and the 
Managing Others' Emotions subscale. The main limitation of the study was the 
attrition of participants between measures. Future research is needed to assess 
EI at the end of the clinical year, after a period of clinical experience, and 
to determine which educational activities are most likely to enhance EI.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to propose an effective end-to-end process in medical 
imaging using an independent task learning (ITL) algorithm and to evaluate its 
performance in maxillary sinusitis applications.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: For the internal dataset, 2122 Waters' view X-ray images, 
which included 1376 normal and 746 sinusitis images, were divided into training 
(n=1824) and test (n=298) datasets. For external validation, 700 images, 
including 379 normal and 321 sinusitis images, from three different institutions 
were evaluated. To develop the automatic diagnosis system algorithm, four 
processing steps were performed: 1) preprocessing for ITL, 2) facial patch 
detection, 3) maxillary sinusitis detection, and 4) a localization report with 
the sinusitis detector.
RESULTS: The accuracy of facial patch detection, which was the first step in the 
end-to-end algorithm, was 100%, 100%, 99.5%, and 97.5% for the internal set and 
external validation sets #1, #2, and #3, respectively. The accuracy and area 
under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of maxillary sinusitis 
detection were 88.93% (0.89), 91.67% (0.90), 90.45% (0.86), and 85.13% (0.85) 
for the internal set and external validation sets #1, #2, and #3, respectively. 
The accuracy and AUC of the fully automatic sinusitis diagnosis system, 
including site localization, were 79.87% (0.80), 84.67% (0.82), 83.92% (0.82), 
and 73.85% (0.74) for the internal set and external validation sets #1, #2, and 
#3, respectively.
CONCLUSION: ITL application for maxillary sinusitis showed reasonable 
performance in internal and external validation tests, compared with 
applications used in previous studies.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to identify a relationship between the 
background environment, bystander and emergency medical services intervention, 
and favourable neurological outcomes (CPC1-2) one-month after out-of-hospital 
cardiac arrest (OHCA) occurred at Tokyo train and subway stations.
METHODS: This retrospective observational study used OHCA data between 2014 and 
2018 that occurred at train stations in Tokyo. The eligible 954 patients were 
analysed for correlation between background, time frame, and location. 
Multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate factors 
associated with CPC1-2 in patients with cardiogenic OHCA.
RESULTS: A total of 886 OHCA cases, cardiogenic (n=562) and non-cardiogenic 
(n=324), met the inclusion criteria. Of the cardiogenic cases, 71.9% occurred at 
the platform and on-a-train. One-month CPC1-2 was achieved in 32.0% of 
cardiogenic OHCAs, which included 47.3% during morning rush hour, 24.7% during 
daytime hours, 40.2% during evening rush hour, and 20.5% during night-time/early 
morning hours. CPC1-2 had significant correlation with morning rush hour 
(adjusted odds ratio [AOR],4.52; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09-18.78), 
evening rush hour (AOR, 6.85; 95% CI, 1.51-31.15), public access defibrillation 
(AOR, 5.19; 95% CI, 1.38-19.51), and ventricular fibrillation or pulseless 
ventricular tachycardia (AOR, 7.56; 95% CI, 1.35-42.43).
CONCLUSION: A total of 71.9% of cardiogenic OHCAs occurred at platforms and on 
trains. To improve neurological outcomes of OHCAs at stations, AED installations 
on train platforms are necessary. Additionally, using artificial 
intelligence-based platform monitoring for early detection of OHCAs and offering 
CPR training are required.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a leading cause 
of childhood blindness. Screening and treatment reduces this risk, but requires 
multiple examinations of infants, most of whom will not develop severe disease. 
Previous work has suggested that artificial intelligence may be able to detect 
incident severe disease (treatment-requiring retinopathy of prematurity 
[TR-ROP]) before clinical diagnosis. We aimed to build a risk model that 
combined artificial intelligence with clinical demographics to reduce the number 
of examinations without missing cases of TR-ROP.
METHODS: Infants undergoing routine ROP screening examinations (1579 total eyes, 
190 with TR-ROP) were recruited from 8 North American study centers. A vascular 
severity score (VSS) was derived from retinal fundus images obtained at 32 to 33 
weeks' postmenstrual age. Seven ElasticNet logistic regression models were 
trained on all combinations of birth weight, gestational age, and VSS. The area 
under the precision-recall curve was used to identify the highest-performing 
model.
RESULTS: The gestational age + VSS model had the highest performance (mean ± SD 
area under the precision-recall curve: 0.35 ± 0.11). On 2 different test data 
sets (n = 444 and n = 132), sensitivity was 100% (positive predictive value: 
28.1% and 22.6%) and specificity was 48.9% and 80.8% (negative predictive value: 
100.0%).
CONCLUSIONS: Using a single examination, this model identified all infants who 
developed TR-ROP, on average, >1 month before diagnosis with moderate to high 
specificity. This approach could lead to earlier identification of incident 
severe ROP, reducing late diagnosis and treatment while simultaneously reducing 
the number of ROP examinations and unnecessary physiologic stress for low-risk 
infants.

Current high-throughput screening assay optimization is often a manual and 
time-consuming process, even when utilizing design-of-experiment approaches. A 
cross-platform, Cloud-based Bayesian optimization-based algorithm was developed 
as part of the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) 
ASPIRE (A Specialized Platform for Innovative Research Exploration) Initiative 
to accelerate preclinical drug discovery. A cell-free assay for papain enzymatic 
activity was used as proof of concept for biological assay development and 
system operationalization. Compared with a brute-force approach that 
sequentially tested all 294 assay conditions to find the global optimum, the 
Bayesian optimization algorithm could find suitable conditions for optimal assay 
performance by testing 21 assay conditions on average, with up to 20 conditions 
being tested simultaneously, as confirmed by repeated simulation. The algorithm 
could achieve a sevenfold reduction in costs for lab supplies and 
high-throughput experimentation runtime, all while being controlled from a 
remote site through a secure connection. Based on this proof of concept, this 
technology is expected to be applied to more complex biological assays and 
automated chemistry reaction screening at NCATS, and should be transferable to 
other institutions.

Recently, because of the unique properties of anisotropic and isotropic 
structures, there are more research studies on anisotropic hydrogels. We 
prepared a gradient anisotropic carboxymethyl cellulose hydrogel (CMC-Al3+) by 
directionally diffusing aluminum chloride solution. The orientation of 
carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) chains is perpendicular to the direction of 
aluminum ion diffusion. The degree of cross-linking and orientation gradually 
decrease along the direction of aluminum ion diffusion. Compared with 
anisotropic hydrogels prepared by other methods, the hydrogels prepared by 
directionally diffusing aluminum ion solution have a gradient lamellar 
structure. Because of the large amount of aluminum ions in CMC-Al3+, the 
hydrogel shows good sensing performance. CMC-Al3+ is packaged with PVC 
electrical flame retardant tape to produce a strain sensor used to detect human 
tiny movements, which can accurately and stably monitor tiny movements. 
Hydrogel-based strain sensors can be widely used in the fields of human-computer 
intelligence, human-computer interaction, and wearable devices in the future.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging technology with great potential, and 
its robust calculation and analysis capabilities are unmatched by traditional 
calculation tools. With the promotion of deep learning and open-source 
platforms, the threshold of AI has also become lower. Combining artificial 
intelligence with traditional fields to create new fields of high research and 
application value has become a trend. AI has been involved in many disciplines, 
such as medicine, materials, energy, and economics. The development of AI 
requires the support of many kinds of data, and microfluidic systems can often 
mine object data on a large scale to support AI. Due to the excellent synergy 
between the two technologies, excellent research results have emerged in many 
fields. In this review, we briefly review AI and microfluidics and introduce 
some applications of their combination, mainly in nanomedicine and material 
synthesis. Finally, we discuss the development trend of the combination of the 
two technologies.

Owing to their unique physicochemical properties, ionic liquids (ILs) have been 
rapidly applied in diverse areas, such as organic synthesis, electrochemistry, 
analytical chemistry, functional materials, pharmaceutics, and biomedicine. The 
increase in the production and application of ILs has resulted in their release 
into aquatic and terrestrial environments. Because of their low vapor pressure, 
ILs cause very little pollution in the atmosphere compared to organic solvents. 
However, ILs are highly persistent in aquatic and terrestrial environments due 
to their stability, and therefore, potentially threaten the safety of 
eco-environments and human health. Specifically, the environmental translocation 
and retention of ILs, or their accumulation in organisms, are all related to 
their physiochemical properties, such as hydrophobicity. Based on results of 
ecotoxicity, cytotoxicity, and toxicity in mammalian models, the mechanisms 
involved in IL-induced toxicity include damage of cell membranes and induction 
of oxidative stress. Recently, artificial intelligence and machine learning 
techniques have been used in mining and modeling toxicity data to make 
meaningful predictions. Major future challenges are also discussed. This review 
will accelerate our understanding of the safety issues of ILs and serve as a 
guideline for the design of the next generation of ILs.

Population and public health are in the midst of an artificial intelligence 
revolution capable of radically altering existing models of care delivery and 
practice. Just as AI seeks to mirror human cognition through its data-driven 
analytics, it can also reflect the biases present in our collective conscience. 
In this Viewpoint, we use past and counterfactual examples to illustrate the 
sequelae of unmitigated bias in healthcare artificial intelligence. Past 
examples indicate that if the benefits of emerging AI technologies are to be 
realized, consensus around the regulation of algorithmic bias at the policy 
level is needed to ensure their ethical integration into the health system. This 
paper puts forth regulatory strategies for uprooting bias in healthcare AI that 
can inform ongoing efforts to establish a framework for federal oversight. We 
highlight three overarching oversight principles in bias mitigation that maps to 
each phase of the algorithm life cycle.

AIM: To explore current research on the ethics of smart home technologies 
including artificial intelligence and information technologies for elderly care 
by conducting a scoping review.
BACKGROUND: The development of smart home technologies for care of the older 
adults provides potential solutions to reduce the caregiver burden within 
families where they are urgently needed. Building an ethical system to support 
the application of these technical products should be explored.
METHODS: The literature search was performed in seven electronic databases. 
Relevant studies from January 2015 to February 2021 were selected; screening and 
analysis were completed independently by two researchers.
RESULTS: There were a total of 15 included studies on the ethics of smart home 
technologies for elderly care, which focused on the following issues: privacy 
(information privacy and physical privacy), autonomy (independence, informed 
consent and user-centred control), safety guarantee, fairness and concerns about 
reduced human contact.
CONCLUSIONS: There exist a number of ethical conflicts in the application of 
smart home technologies for elderly care. Therefore, it is necessary to further 
investigate the ethical issues with regards to the decision-making process of 
weighing the advantages and disadvantages of these technologies.
IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Efforts should be made to establish a 
corresponding ethical framework to ensure the sustainable development of smart, 
home-based elderly care. Nurses may play an important role in the design and 
implementation of these technologies to promote ethical awareness and practice.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to develop an efficient and easily calculable risk 
score that can be used to identify an individual's risk of having been exposed 
to alcohol prenatally.
METHODS: Data for this study were collected as part of the Collaborative 
Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders, Phases 2 and 3. Two cohorts 
(ages 5 to 17 years) completed a comprehensive neurobehavioral battery and a 
standard dysmorphology exam: a development cohort (DC; n = 325) and a 
comparative cohort (CC; n = 523). Both cohorts included two groups: those with 
histories of heavy prenatal alcohol exposure (AE-DC, n = 121; AE-CC, n = 177) 
and a control group that included subjects with minimal or no prenatal alcohol 
exposure (CON-DC, n = 204; CON-CC, n = 346). Behavioral assessments and physical 
exam data were combined using regression techniques to derive a risk score 
indicating the likelihood of prenatal alcohol exposure. Subjects were then 
divided into two subgroups: (1) low risk and (2) high risk. Chi-square (χ2 ) 
determined classification accuracy and ROC curves were produced to assess the 
predictive accuracy. Correlations between risk scores and intelligence quotient 
and executive function scores were calculated.
RESULTS: Subjects were accurately classified in the DC (χ2  = 78.61, p < 0.001) 
and CC (χ2  = 86.63, p < 0.001). The classification model also performed well in 
the DC (ROC = 0.835 [SE = 0.024, p < 0.001]) and CC (ROC = 0.786 [SE = 0.021, 
p < 0.001]). In the AE-CC and CON-CC, there were modest but significant 
associations between the risk score and executive function (AE-CC: r = -0.20, 
p = 0.034; CON-CC: r = -0.28, p < 0.001) and intelligence quotient (AE-CC: 
r = -0.20, p = 0.034; CON-CC: r = -0.28, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION(S): The risk score significantly distinguished alcohol-exposed from 
control subjects and correlated with important cognitive outcomes. It has 
significant clinical potential and could be easily deployed in clinical 
settings.

An appropriate threshold is a key to using the multi-threshold segmentation 
method to solve image segmentation problems, and the swarm intelligence (SI) 
optimization algorithm is one of the popular methods to obtain the optimal 
threshold. Moreover, Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA) is a recently released swarm 
intelligent optimization algorithm. Compared with other SI optimization 
algorithms, the optimization solution strategy of the SSA still needs to be 
improved to enhance further the solution accuracy and optimization efficiency of 
the algorithm. Accordingly, this paper designs an effective segmentation method 
based on a non-local mean 2D histogram and 2D Kapur's entropy called SSA with 
Gaussian Barebone and Stochastic Fractal Search (GBSFSSSA) by combining Gaussian 
Barebone and Stochastic Fractal Search mechanism. In GBSFSSSA, the Gaussian 
Barebone and Stochastic Fractal Search mechanism effectively balance the global 
search ability and local search ability of the basic SSA. The CEC2017 
competition data set is used to prove the algorithm's performance, and GBSFSSSA 
shows an absolute advantage over some typical competitive algorithms. 
Furthermore, the algorithm is applied in image segmentation of COVID-19 CT 
images, and the results are analyzed based on three different metrics: peak 
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity (SSIM), and feature 
similarity (FSIM), which can lead to the conclusion that the overall performance 
of GBSFSSSA is better than the comparison algorithm and can effectively improve 
the segmentation of medical images. Therefore, it is justified that GBSFSSSA is 
a reliable and effective method in solving the multi-threshold image 
segmentation problem.

Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors are becoming an essential drug in the 
treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus; however, some classes of these drugs 
exert side effects, including joint pain and pancreatitis. Studies suggest that 
these side effects might be related to secondary inhibition of DPP-8 and DPP-9. 
In this study, we identified DPP-4-inhibitor hit compounds selective against 
DPP-8 and DPP-9. We built a virtual screening workflow using a quantitative 
structure-activity relationship (QSAR) strategy based on artificial intelligence 
to allow faster screening of millions of molecules for the DPP-4 target relative 
to other screening methods. Five regression machine learning algorithms and four 
classification machine learning algorithms were applied to build virtual 
screening workflows, with the QSAR model applied using support vector regression 
(R2pred 0.78) and the classification QSAR model using the random forest 
algorithm with 92.2% accuracy. Virtual screening results of > 10 million 
molecules obtained 2 716 hits compounds with a pIC50 value of > 7.5. 
Additionally, molecular docking results of several potential hit compounds for 
DPP-4, DPP-8, and DPP-9 identified CH0002 as showing high inhibitory potential 
against DPP-4 and low inhibitory potential for DPP-8 and DPP-9 enzymes. These 
results demonstrated the effectiveness of this technique for identifying 
DPP-4-inhibitor hit compounds selective for DPP-4 and against DPP-8 and DPP-9 
and suggest its potential efficacy for applications to discover hit compounds of 
other targets.

There is limited access to effective cervical cancer screening programs in many 
resource-limited settings, resulting in continued high cervical cancer burden. 
Human papillomavirus (HPV) testing is increasingly recognized to be the 
preferable primary screening approach if affordable due to superior long-term 
reassurance when negative and adaptability to self-sampling. Visual inspection 
with acetic acid (VIA) is an inexpensive but subjective and inaccurate method 
widely used in resource-limited settings, either for primary screening or for 
triage of HPV-positive individuals. A deep learning (DL)-based automated visual 
evaluation (AVE) of cervical images has been developed to help improve the 
accuracy and reproducibility of VIA as assistive technology. However, like any 
new clinical technology, rigorous evaluation and proof of clinical effectiveness 
are required before AVE is implemented widely. In the current article, we 
outline essential clinical and technical considerations involved in building a 
validated DL-based AVE tool for broad use as a clinical test.

New herbicide modes of action (MOAs) are in great demand because of the 
burgeoning evolution of resistance of weeds to existing commercial herbicides. 
This need has been exacerbated by the almost complete lack of introduction of 
herbicides with new MOAs for almost 40 years. There are many highly phytotoxic 
compounds with MOAs not represented by commercial herbicides, but neither these 
compounds nor structural analogues have been developed as herbicides for a 
variety of reasons. Natural products provide knowledge of many MOAs that are not 
being utilized by commercial herbicides. Other means of identifying new 
herbicide targets are discussed, including pharmaceutical target sites and 
metabolomic and proteomic information, as well as the use of artificial 
intelligence and machine learning to predict herbicidal compounds with new MOAs. 
Information about several newly discovered herbicidal compounds with new MOAs is 
summarized. The currently increased efforts of both established companies and 
start-up companies are likely to result in herbicides with new MOAs that can be 
used in herbicide resistance management within the next decade. © 2021 Society

The development of medical imaging artificial intelligence (AI) systems for 
evaluating COVID-19 patients has demonstrated potential for improving clinical 
decision making and assessing patient outcomes during the recent COVID-19 
pandemic. These have been applied to many medical imaging tasks, including 
disease diagnosis and patient prognosis, as well as augmented other clinical 
measurements to better inform treatment decisions. Because these systems are 
used in life-or-death decisions, clinical implementation relies on user trust in 
the AI output. This has caused many developers to utilize explainability 
techniques in an attempt to help a user understand when an AI algorithm is 
likely to succeed as well as which cases may be problematic for automatic 
assessment, thus increasing the potential for rapid clinical translation. AI 
application to COVID-19 has been marred with controversy recently. This review 
discusses several aspects of explainable and interpretable AI as it pertains to 
the evaluation of COVID-19 disease and it can restore trust in AI application to 
this disease. This includes the identification of common tasks that are relevant 
to explainable medical imaging AI, an overview of several modern approaches for 
producing explainable output as appropriate for a given imaging scenario, a 
discussion of how to evaluate explainable AI, and recommendations for best 
practices in explainable/interpretable AI implementation. This review will allow 
developers of AI systems for COVID-19 to quickly understand the basics of 
several explainable AI techniques and assist in the selection of an approach 
that is both appropriate and effective for a given scenario.

Tuberculosis (TB) is the greatest irresistible illness in humans, caused by 
microbes Mycobacterium TB (MTB) bacteria and is an infectious disease that 
spreads from one individual to another through the air. It principally 
influences lung, which is termed Pulmonary TB (PTB). However, it can likewise 
influence other parts of the body such as the brain, bones and lymph nodes. 
Hence, it is also referred to as Extra Pulmonary TB (EPTB). TB has normal 
symptoms, so without proper testing, it is hard to detect if a patient has TB or 
not. In this paper, an accurate and novel system for diagnosing TB (PTB and 
EPTB) has been designed using image processing and AI-based classification 
techniques. The designed system is comprised of two phases. Firstly, the X-Ray 
image is processed using preprocessing, segmentation and features extraction and 
then, three different AI-based techniques are applied for classification. For 
image processing, 'Histogram Filter' and 'Median Filter' are applied with the 
CLAHE process to retrieve the segmented image. Then, classification based on AI 
techniques is done. The designed system produces the accuracy of 98%, 83%, and 
89% for Decision Tree, SVM, and Naïve Bayes Classifier, respectively and has 
been validated by the doctors of the Jalandhar, India.

OBJECTIVE: Lateral temporal lobe epilepsies (LTLE) are poorly characterized 
heterogeneous epilepsies. As the lateral temporal lobe supports distinct 
functions, we hypothesized that neuropsychological profiles could differ 
according to the localization of the seizure focus within the lateral temporal 
lobe.
METHODS: We retrospectively examined the neuropsychological characteristics of 
74 consecutive patients with refractory LTLE assessed in the context of a 
presurgical investigation at the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris between 
1998 and 2018. Precise localization of the epileptic focus was correlated with 
scores on tests of intelligence (Global, Verbal and Performance IQ), working 
memory, episodic memory (verbal and visual learning and forgetting), executive 
functions, and language abilities.
RESULTS: We demonstrated an impact of the localization of the epileptic focus 
within the lateral temporal lobe with worse learning and/or executive 
performances depicted in the infero-basal and pure pole LTLE groups and greater 
language difficulties in the posterior LTLE group, Antiepileptic drugs had a 
greater effect than parameters related to the epilepsy itself as the lesion or 
the disease duration, and finally as in medial TLE, the age, education, and sex 
influenced some cognitive performances.
CONCLUSION: Our findings show that the lateral temporal neocortex is also part 
of the neural substrate for memory processing and executive functions and 
suggest that this involvement could be related to functions devoted to specific 
subregions of the temporal lobe (i.e., temporal pole, inferior and basal 
regions) that support language and semantic processing.

Correlates of Korean Hangul Reading in Children With Hearing Loss.

This study examined the associations of vocabulary and phonological and 
orthographic awareness with Hangul word reading in Korean children, aged between 
7 and 10 years, who were deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) and children with 
typical hearing (TH). The participants were 24 children with hearing aids (HAs), 
24 children with cochlear implants (CIs), and 24 TH children in Korea. The three 
groups were matched for chronological age, vocabulary age, and nonverbal 
intelligence. Results showed that there were no differences between children 
with CIs and those with HAs in reading fluency and cognitive skills, except 
word-reading accuracy, whereas children with CIs and HAs were delayed in all 
measures compared with their TH peers. Regression analyses showed that syllable 
and phoneme awareness uniquely explained word-reading accuracy in children with 
DHH and those with TH. However, word-reading fluency was uniquely explained by 
syllable awareness in the DHH children and by vocabulary and orthographic 
awareness in the TH children. These results suggest that DHH and TH children in 
Korea rely on phonological awareness for Korean word recognition. However, DHH 
and TH Korean children tend to use different strategies based on sublexical 
versus lexical information, respectively, to read Korean words fluently.

Artificial intelligence (AI) based self-learning or self-improving material 
discovery system will enable next-generation material discovery. Herein, we 
demonstrate how to combine accurate prediction of material performance via 
first-principle calculations and Bayesian optimization-based active learning to 
realize a self-improving discovery system for high-performance photosensitizers 
(PSs). Through self-improving cycles, such a system can improve the model 
prediction accuracy (best mean absolute error of 0.090 eV for singlet-triplet 
spitting) and high-performance PS search ability, realizing efficient discovery 
of PSs. From a molecular space with more than 7 million molecules, 5357 
potential high-performance PSs were discovered. Four PSs were further 
synthesized to show performance comparable with or superior to commercial ones. 
This work highlights the potential of active learning in first-principle-based 
materials design, and the discovered structures could boost the development of 
photosensitization related applications.

BACKGROUND: Complications due to type 2 diabetes (T2D) can be mitigated through 
proper self-management that can positively change health behaviors. 
Technological tools are available to help people living with, or at risk of 
developing, T2D to manage their condition, and such tools provide a large 
repository of patient-generated health data (PGHD). Analytics can provide 
insights into the health behaviors of people living with T2D.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review is to investigate what can be learned about 
the health behaviors of those living with, or at risk of developing, T2D through 
analytics from PGHD.
METHODS: A scoping review using the Arksey and O'Malley framework was conducted 
in which a comprehensive search of the literature was conducted by 2 reviewers. 
In all, 3 electronic databases (PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library) 
were searched using keywords associated with diabetes, behaviors, and analytics. 
Several rounds of screening using predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria 
were conducted, after which studies were selected. Critical examination took 
place through a descriptive-analytical narrative method, and data extracted from 
the studies were classified into thematic categories. These categories reflect 
the findings of this study as per our objective.
RESULTS: We identified 43 studies that met the inclusion criteria for this 
review. Although 70% (30/43) of the studies examined PGHD independently, 30% 
(13/43) combined PGHD with other data sources. Most of these studies used 
machine learning algorithms to perform their analysis. The themes identified 
through this review include predicting diabetes or obesity, deriving factors 
that contribute to diabetes or obesity, obtaining insights from social media or 
web-based forums, predicting glycemia, improving adherence and outcomes, 
analyzing sedentary behaviors, deriving behavior patterns, discovering clinical 
correlations from behaviors, and developing design principles.
CONCLUSIONS: The increased volume and availability of PGHD have the potential to 
derive analytical insights into the health behaviors of people living with T2D. 
From the literature, we determined that analytics can predict outcomes and 
identify granular behavior patterns from PGHD. This review determined the broad 
range of insights that can be examined through PGHD, which constitutes a unique 
source of data for these applications that would not be possible through the use 
of other data sources.

Fluid intelligence (Gƒ) includes logical reasoning abilities and is an essential 
component of normative cognition. Despite the broad consensus that 
parieto-prefrontal connectivity is critical for Gƒ (e.g. the parieto-frontal 
integration theory of intelligence, P-FIT), the dynamics of such functional 
connectivity during logical reasoning remains poorly understood. Further, given 
the known importance of these brain regions for Gƒ, numerous studies have 
targeted one or both of these areas with non-invasive stimulation with the goal 
of improving Gƒ, but to date there remains little consensus on the overall 
stimulation-related effects. To examine this, we applied high-definition direct 
current anodal stimulation to the left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex 
(DLPFC) of 24 healthy adults for 20 min in three separate sessions (sham, left, 
and right active). Following stimulation, participants completed a logical 
reasoning task during magnetoencephalography (MEG). Significant neural responses 
at the sensor-level were imaged using a beamformer, and peak task-induced 
activity was subjected to dynamic functional connectivity analyses to evaluate 
the impact of distinct stimulation montages on network activity. We found that 
participants responded faster following right DLPFC stimulation vs. sham. 
Moreover, our neural findings followed a similar trajectory of effects such that 
left parieto-frontal connectivity decreased following right and left DLPFC 
stimulation compared to sham, with connectivity following right stimulation 
being significantly correlated with the faster reaction times. Importantly, our 
findings are consistent with P-FIT, as well as the neural efficiency hypothesis 
(NEH) of intelligence. In sum, this study provides evidence for beneficial 
effects of right DLPFC stimulation on logical reasoning. KEY POINTS: Logical 
reasoning is an indispensable component of fluid intelligence and involves 
multispectral oscillatory activity in parietal and frontal regions. 
Parieto-frontal integration is well characterized in logical reasoning; however, 
its direct neural quantification and neuromodulation by brain stimulation remain 
poorly understood. High-definition transcranial direct current stimulation of 
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) had modulatory effects on task 
performance and neural interactions serving logical reasoning, with right 
stimulation showing beneficial effects. Right DLPFC stimulation led to a 
decrease in the response time (i.e. better task performance) and left 
parieto-frontal connectivity with a marginal positive association between 
behavioural and neural metrics. Other modes of targeted stimulation of DLPFC 
(e.g. frequency-specific) can be employed in future studies.

Orbital telorism, the interocular distance, is clinically informative and in 
extremes is considered a minor physical anomaly. While its extremes, hypo- and 
hypertelorism, have been linked to disorders often related to cognitive ability, 
little is known about the neural correlates of normal variation of telorism 
within the general population. We derived measures of orbital telorism from 
cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) by calculating the distance between the 
eyeball center of gravity in two population-based datasets (N = 5,653, 
N = 29,824; mean age 64.66, 63.75 years). This measure was found to be related 
to grey matter tissue density within numerous regions of the brain, including, 
but surprisingly not limited to, the frontal regions, in both positive and 
negative directions. Additionally, telorism was related to several cognitive 
functions, such as Purdue pegboard test (Beta, P-value (CI95%) -.02, 1.63 × 10-7 
(-.03:-.01)) and fluid intelligence (.02, 4.75 × 10-6 (.01:0.02)), with some 
relationships driven by individuals with a smaller orbital telorism. This is 
reflective of the higher prevalence of hypotelorism in developmental disorders, 
specifically those that accompany lower cognitive lower functioning. This study 
suggests, despite previous links only made in clinical extremes, that orbital 
telorism holds some relation to structural brain development and cognitive 
function in the general population. This relationship is likely driven by shared 
developmental periods.

Artificial Intelligence as Accelerator for Genomic Medicine and Planetary 
Health.

Genomic medicine has made important strides over the past several decades, but 
as new insights and technologies emerge, the applications of genomics in 
medicine and planetary health continue to evolve and expand. An important grand 
challenge is harnessing and making sense of the genomic big data in ways that 
best serve public and planetary health. Because human health is inextricably 
intertwined with the health of planetary ecosystems and nonhuman animals, 
genomic medicine is in need of high throughput bioinformatics analyses to 
harness and integrate human and ecological multiomics big data. It is in this 
overarching context that artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine 
learning and deep learning, offers enormous potentials to advance genomic 
medicine in a spirit of One Health. This expert review offers an analysis of the 
rapidly emerging role of AI in genomic medicine, including its current drivers, 
levers, opportunities, and challenges. The scope of AI applications in genomic 
medicine is broad, ranging from efficient and automated data analysis to drug 
repurposing and precision medicine, as with its challenges such as veracity of 
the big data that AI sorely depends on, social biases that the AI-driven 
algorithms can introduce, and how best to incorporate AI with human 
intelligence. The road ahead for AI in genomic medicine is complex and arduous 
and yet worthy of cautious optimism as we face future pandemics and ecological 
crises in the 21st century. Now is a good time to think about the role of AI in 
genomic medicine and planetary health.

Deep Learning shows promising performance in diverse fields and has become an 
emerging technology in Artificial Intelligence. Recent visual recognition is 
based on the ranking of photographs and the finding of artefacts in those 
images. The aim of this research is to classify the different cough sounds of 
COVID-19 artefacts in the signals of altered real-life environments. The 
introduced model takes into consideration two major steps. The first step is the 
transformation phase from sound to image that is optimized by the scalogram 
technique. The second step involves feature extraction and classification based 
on six deep transfer models (GoogleNet, ResNet18, ResNet50, ResNet101, 
MobileNetv2, and NasNetmobile). The dataset used contains 1457 (755 of COVID-19 
and 702 of healthy) wave cough sounds. Although our recognition model performs 
the best, its accuracy only reaches 94.9% based on SGDM optimizer. The accuracy 
is promising enough for a wide set of labeled cough data to test the potential 
for generalization. The outcomes show that ResNet18 is the most stable model to 
classify the cough sounds from a limited dataset with a sensitivity of 94.44% 
and a specificity of 95.37%. Finally, a comparison of the research with a 
similar analysis is made. It is observed that the proposed model is more 
reliable and accurate than any current models. Cough research precision is 
promising enough to test the ability for extrapolation and generalization.

OBJECTIVES: The use of cortical auditory evoked potentials allows for the study 
of the processing of acoustic signals at the cortical level, an important step 
in the diagnostic evaluation process, and for the monitoring of the therapeutic 
process associated with auditory processing disorders (APD). The differences and 
similarities in the acoustic coding between different types of stimuli in the 
context of APD remain unknown to this date.
METHODS: A total of 37 children aged between 7 and 11 years, with and without 
APDs (identified based on verbal and non-verbal tests), all with a suitable 
intelligence quotient with respect to their chronological age, were assessed. 
Components P1 and N1 were studied using verbal and non-verbal stimuli.
RESULTS: The comparison between stimuli in each group revealed that the control 
group had higher latency and amplitude values for speech stimuli, except for the 
P1 amplitude, while the group with APDs had different results with respect to 
the amplitudes of P1 and N1, yielding higher values for speech sounds. The 
differences between the groups varied according to the type of stimulus: the 
difference was in amplitude for the verbal stimulus and latency for the 
non-verbal stimulus.
CONCLUSION: The records of components P1 and N1 revealed that the children with 
APDs performed the coding underlying the detection and identification of 
acoustic signals, whether verbal and non-verbal, according to a different 
pattern than the children in the control group.

Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic caused by severe 
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which can be 
transmitted from person to person. As of September 21, 2021, over 228 million 
cases were diagnosed as COVID-19 infection in more than 200 countries and 
regions worldwide. The death toll is more than 4.69 million and the mortality 
rate has reached about 2.05% as it has gradually become a global plague, and the 
numbers are growing. Therefore, it is important to gain a deeper understanding 
of the genome and protein characteristics, clinical diagnostics, pathogenic 
mechanisms, and the development of antiviral drugs and vaccines against the 
novel coronavirus to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. The traditional biology 
technologies are limited for COVID-19-related studies to understand the pandemic 
happening. Bioinformatics is the application of computational methods and 
analytical tools in the field of biological research which has obvious 
advantages in predicting the structure, product, function, and evolution of 
unknown genes and proteins, and in screening drugs and vaccines from a large 
amount of sequence information. Here, we comprehensively summarized several of 
the most important methods and applications relating to COVID-19 based on 
currently available reports of bioinformatics technologies, focusing on future 
research for overcoming the virus pandemic. Based on the next-generation 
sequencing (NGS) and third-generation sequencing (TGS) technology, not only 
virus can be detected, but also high quality SARS-CoV-2 genome could be obtained 
quickly. The emergence of data of genome sequences, variants, haplotypes of 
SARS-CoV-2 help us to understand genome and protein structure, variant calling, 
mutation, and other biological characteristics. After sequencing alignment and 
phylogenetic analysis, the bat may be the natural host of the novel coronavirus. 
Single-cell RNA sequencing provide abundant resource for discovering the 
mechanism of immune response induced by COVID-19. As an entry receptor, 
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) can be used as a potential drug target to 
treat COVID-19. Molecular dynamics simulation, molecular docking and artificial 
intelligence (AI) technology of bioinformatics methods based on drug databases 
for SARS-CoV-2 can accelerate the development of drugs. Meanwhile, computational 
approaches are helpful to identify suitable vaccines to prevent COVID-19 
infection through reverse vaccinology, Immunoinformatics and structural 
vaccinology.

The intelligent method proposed herein is formulated on a deep learning 
technique which can identify, localise and map the shape of plastic debris in 
the marine environment. Utilising images depicting plastic litter from six 
beaches in Cyprus, the developed tool pointed to a plastic litter density of 
0.035 items/m2. Extrapolated to the entire shorelines of the island, the 
intelligent approach estimated about 66,000 plastic articles weighting a total 
of ≈1000 kg. Besides deducing the plastic litter density, the dimensions of all 
documented plastic litter were determined with the aid of the OpenCV Contours 
image processing tool. Results revealed that the dominant object length ranged 
between 10 and 30 cm which is in agreement with the length of common plastic 
litter often spoiling these coastlines. Concluding, only in-situ visual scan 
sample surveys and no manual collection means were used to predict the density 
and the dimensions of the plastic litter.

CONTEXT: Clinical supervisors make judgements about how much to trust learners 
with critical activities in patient care. Such decisions mediate trainees' 
opportunities for learning and competency development and thus are a critical 
component of education. As educators apply entrustment frameworks to assessment, 
it is important to determine how narrative feedback reflecting entrustment may 
also address learners' educational needs.
METHODS: In this study, we used artificial intelligence (AI) and natural 
language processing (NLP) to identify characteristics of feedback tied to 
supervisors' entrustment decisions during direct observation encounters of 
clerkship medical students (3328 unique observations). Supervisors conducted 
observations of students and collaborated with them to complete an 
entrustment-based assessment in which they documented narrative feedback and 
assigned an entrustment rating. We trained a deep neural network (DNN) to 
predict entrustment levels from the narrative data and developed an explainable 
AI protocol to uncover the latent thematic features the DNN used to make its 
prediction.
RESULTS: We found that entrustment levels were associated with level of detail 
(specific steps for performing clinical tasks), feedback type (constructive 
versus reinforcing) and task type (procedural versus cognitive). In justifying 
both high and low levels of entrustment, supervisors detailed concrete steps 
that trainees performed (or did not yet perform) competently.
CONCLUSIONS: Framing our results in the factors previously identified as 
influencing entrustment, we find a focus on performance details related to 
trainees' clinical competency as opposed to nonspecific feedback on trainee 
qualities. The entrustment framework reflected in feedback appeared to guide 
specific goal-setting, combined with details necessary to reach those goals. Our 
NLP methodology can also serve as a starting point for future work on 
entrustment and feedback as similar assessment datasets accumulate.

AIMS: Effective and efficient education and patient engagement are fundamental 
to improve health outcomes in heart failure (HF). The use of artificial 
intelligence (AI) to enable more effective delivery of education is becoming 
more widespread for a range of chronic conditions. We sought to determine 
whether an avatar-based HF-app could improve outcomes by enhancing HF knowledge 
and improving patient quality of life and self-care behaviour.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In a randomized controlled trial of patients admitted for 
acute decompensated HF (ADHF), patients at high risk (≥33%) for 30-day hospital 
readmission and/or death were randomized to usual care or training with the 
HF-app. From August 2019 up until December 2020, 200 patients admitted to the 
hospital for ADHF were enrolled in the Risk-HF study. Of the 72 at high-risk, 36 
(25 men; median age 81.5 years; 9.5 years of education; 15 in NYHA Class III at 
discharge) were randomized into the intervention arm and were offered education 
involving an HF-app. Whilst 26 (72%) could not use the HF-app, younger patients 
[odds ratio (OR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82-0.97; P < 0.01] and 
those with a higher education level (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.09-2.28; P = 0.03) were 
more likely to enrol. Of those enrolled, only 2 of 10 patients engaged and 
completed ≥70% of the program, and 6 of the remaining 8 who did not engage were 
readmitted.
CONCLUSIONS: Although AI-based education is promising in chronic conditions, our 
study provides a note of caution about the barriers to enrolment in critically 
ill, post-acute, and elderly patients.

In Atkins v. Virginia, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the execution of 
defendants with an intellectual disability is "cruel and unusual punishment" 
prohibited by the Eighth Amendment. In a 6 to 3 decision, the Court noted the 
increasing number of states that blocked the executions of persons with an 
intellectual disability, reflecting the country's growing consensus that 
defendants with an intellectual disability are less culpable for their crimes 
than those without such a disability. Since this milestone decision, several 
subsequent cases have referenced this opinion. This article reviews other cases 
in which the execution of persons with an intellectual disability has been 
called into question, concluding with the Atkins-related appeal in Fuston v. 
State In that case, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals considered Oklahoma 
statutes regarding the bright-line cutoff by which defendants meet criteria for 
intellectual disability, as applied to the multiple intelligence measures that 
were administered to Mr. Fuston. The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals 
determined that Mr. Fuston did not meet the criteria for intellectual disability 
because of his performance on a single IQ measure administered when he was 12 
years old, instead of the totality of his performance on subsequent intelligence 
measures. Mr. Fuston was also denied 14 other, unrelated propositions on appeal, 
and the state reaffirmed his death sentence. Implications and recommendations 
for forensic practice are discussed.

The ability to use symbols is a defining feature of human intelligence. However, 
neuroscience has yet to explain the fundamental neural circuit mechanisms for 
flexibly representing and manipulating abstract concepts. This article will 
review the research on neural models for symbolic processing. The review first 
focuses on the question of how symbols could possibly be represented in neural 
circuits. The review then addresses how neural symbolic representations could be 
flexibly combined to meet a wide range of reasoning demands. Finally, the review 
assesses the research on program synthesis and proposes that the most flexible 
neural representation of symbolic processing would involve the capacity to 
rapidly synthesize neural operations analogous to lambda calculus to solve 
complex cognitive tasks.

INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Artificial intelligence (AI) made it achievable 
that aortic dilation could be measured in CT images indirectly, while aortic 
diameter (AD) has the certain relationship with blood pressure. It was potential 
that the blood pressure condition be determined by AD measurement using the data 
obtained from a CT scanning especially in identifying masked hypertension and 
predicting the risk of poor control of blood pressure (BP) which was easy to 
elude diagnosis in clinic. We aimed to evaluate the possibility of utilizing AD 
by AI for predicting the risk of adverse BP status (including masked 
hypertension or poor BP control) and the optimal thoracic aortic position in 
measurement as well as the cutoff value for predicting the risk.
METHODS: Eight hundred and one patients were enrolled in our study. AI-Rad 
Companion Cardiovascular (K183268 FDA approved) was used to perform automatic 
aorta measurement in thoracic CT images at nine key positions based on AHA 
guidelines. Data was post processed by software from AI-Rad Companion undergone 
rigorous clinical validation by both FDA and CE as verification of its efficacy 
and usability. The AD's risk and diagnostic value was assessed in identifying 
hypertension in the general population, in identifying the poor BP controlled in 
the hypertension population, and in screening masked hypertension in the general 
population respectively by multiple regression analysis and receiver operating 
curve analysis.
RESULTS: AD measured by AI was a risk factor for adverse BP status after 
clinical covariates adjustment (OR = 1.02 ~ 1.26). The AD at mid descending 
aorta was mostly affected by BP particularly, which is optimal indicator in 
identifying hypertension in the general population (AUC = 0.73) and for 
screening masked hypertension (AUC = 0.78).
CONCLUSION: Using AI to measure the AD of the aorta, particularly at the 
position of mid descending aorta, is greatly valuable for identifying people 
with poor BP status. It will be possible to reveal more clinical information 
reflected by ordinary CT images and enrich the screening methods for 
hypertension, especially masked hypertension.PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARYHTN has a 
significant adverse effect on arterial deformation. BP and arterial dilation 
promote each other in a vicious circle. Arterial dilation may not be restricted 
by apparent fluctuations in BP and is objective evidence of an undesirable BP 
state. The accuracy of AD measurements by AI on chest CT images has been 
verified. There has not been the application of AD measurement by AI in the 
scene of poor BP status in clinical practice.In this study, we applied AI to 
measure the diameter of the aorta in nine consecutive positions. We explored the 
association between AD at various positions and BP levels and the possibility 
that AD in identifying poor BP status in different populations. We found that 
the AD at the MD is of great value in screening MH and evaluating the control 
state of BP in HTN. It will be possible to significantly expand the clinical 
information reflected by ordinary CT images and enrich the screening methods for 
HTN, especially MH.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Acute kidney injury (AKI) affects nearly 60% of all patients 
admitted to ICUs. Large volumes of clinical, monitoring and laboratory data 
produced in ICUs allow the application of artificial intelligence analytics. The 
purpose of this article is to assimilate and critically evaluate recently 
published literature regarding artificial intelligence applications for 
predicting, diagnosing and subphenotyping AKI among critically ill patients.
RECENT FINDINGS: Among recent studies regarding artificial intelligence 
implementations for predicting, diagnosing and subphenotyping AKI among 
critically ill patients, there are many promising models, but few had external 
validation, clinical interpretability and high predictive performance. Deep 
learning techniques leveraging multimodal clinical data show great potential to 
provide continuous, accurate, early predictions of AKI risk, which could be 
implemented clinically to optimize preventive and early therapeutic management 
strategies.
SUMMARY: Use of consensus criteria, standard definitions and common data models 
could facilitate access to machine learning-ready data sets for external 
validation. The lack of interpretability, explainability, fairness and 
transparency of artificial intelligence models hinder their entrustment and 
clinical implementation; compliance with standardized reporting guidelines can 
mitigate these challenges.

BACKGROUND: Youth experiencing homelessness (YEH) are at elevated risk of 
HIV/AIDS and disproportionately identify as racial, ethnic, sexual, and gender 
minorities. We developed a new peer change agent (PCA) HIV prevention 
intervention with 3 arms: (1) an arm using an artificial intelligence (AI) 
planning algorithm to select PCAs; (2) a popularity arm, the standard PCA 
approach, operationalized as highest degree centrality (DC); and (3) an 
observation-only comparison group.
SETTING: A total of 713 YEH were recruited from 3 drop-in centers in Los 
Angeles, CA.
METHODS: Youth consented and completed a baseline survey that collected 
self-reported data on HIV knowledge, condom use, and social network information. 
A quasi-experimental pretest/posttest design was used; 472 youth (66.5% 
retention at 1 month postbaseline) and 415 youth (58.5% retention at 3 months 
postbaseline) completed follow-up. In each intervention arm (AI and DC), 20% of 
youth was selected as PCAs and attended a 4-hour initial training, followed by 7 
weeks of half-hour follow-up sessions. Youth disseminated messages promoting HIV 
knowledge and condom use.
RESULTS: Using generalized estimating equation models, there was a significant 
reduction over time (P < 0.001) and a significant time by AI arm interaction (P 
< 0.001) for condomless anal sex act. There was a significant increase in HIV 
knowledge over time among PCAs in DC and AI arms.
CONCLUSIONS: PCA models that promote HIV knowledge and condom use are 
efficacious for YEH. Youth are able to serve as a bridge between 
interventionists and their community. Interventionists should consider working 
with computer scientists to solve implementation problems.

BACKGROUND: Kidney allograft failure is a common cause of end-stage renal 
disease. We aimed to develop a dynamic artificial intelligence approach to 
enhance risk stratification for kidney transplant recipients by generating 
continuously refined predictions of survival using updates of clinical data.
METHODS: In this observational study, we used data from adult recipients of 
kidney transplants from 18 academic transplant centres in Europe, the USA, and 
South America, and a cohort of patients from six randomised controlled trials. 
The development cohort comprised patients from four centres in France, with all 
other patients included in external validation cohorts. To build deeply 
phenotyped cohorts of transplant recipients, the following data were collected 
in the development cohort: clinical, histological, immunological variables, and 
repeated measurements of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and 
proteinuria (measured using the proteinuria to creatininuria ratio). To develop 
a dynamic prediction system based on these clinical assessments and repeated 
measurements, we used a Bayesian joint models-an artificial intelligence 
approach. The prediction performances of the model were assessed via 
discrimination, through calculation of the area under the receiver operator 
curve (AUC), and calibration. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, 
NCT04258891.
FINDINGS: 13 608 patients were included (3774 in the development cohort and 9834 
in the external validation cohorts) and contributed 89 328 patient-years of 
data, and 416 510 eGFR and proteinuria measurements. Bayesian joint models 
showed that recipient immunological profile, allograft interstitial fibrosis and 
tubular atrophy, allograft inflammation, and repeated measurements of eGFR and 
proteinuria were independent risk factors for allograft survival. The final 
model showed accurate calibration and very high discrimination in the 
development cohort (overall dynamic AUC 0·857 [95% CI 0·847-0·866]) with a 
persistent improvement in AUCs for each new repeated measurement (from 0·780 
[0·768-0·794] to 0·926 [0·917-0·932]; p<0·0001). The predictive performance was 
confirmed in the external validation cohorts from Europe (overall AUC 0·845 
[0·837-0·854]), the USA (overall AUC 0·820 [0·808-0·831]), South America 
(overall AUC 0·868 [0·856-0·880]), and the cohort of patients from randomised 
controlled trials (overall AUC 0·857 [0·840-0·875]).
INTERPRETATION: Because of its dynamic design, this model can be continuously 
updated and holds value as a bedside tool that could refine the prognostic 
judgements of clinicians in everyday practice, hence enhancing precision 
medicine in the transplant setting.

Treatment of infertility has evolved as understanding of reproduction has 
improved. Fertility promoting surgery still is performed and recent advances 
have broken new ground. Hormonal treatments to correct gonadal dysfunction have 
been developed, but multiple gestation continues to be a significant 
complication. Assisted reproductive technologies have improved such that 
in vitro fertilization and its variants increasingly are used to treat nearly 
all causes of infertility. Advances in assisted reproduction are of 2 types: (1) 
incremental optimization of existing techniques and (2) development of new, 
disruptive technologies. Artificial intelligence and stem cell technologies are 
poised to have impact in the near future.

Envy is a mixed negative emotion that is characterized by feelings of hostility, 
inferiority, resentment, and depression. It has been found that mindfulness is 
negatively associated with envy. This paper aimed to explore the interaction 
between mindfulness and envy by referring to the mindful emotion regulation 
model, and it also examines the mediation of emotional intelligence. Six hundred 
and seventy-six participants (182 men and 494 women) completed the Mindful 
Attention Awareness Scale, the Dispositional Envy Scale, and the Wong Law 
Emotional Intelligence Scale. Results suggest that mindfulness is significantly 
and negatively correlated with envy. Meanwhile, a multiple mediation analysis 
indicated that regulation of emotion and use of emotion partially mediate the 
impact of mindfulness on envy. The current study not only provides a theoretical 
basis for possible mechanisms underlying the inhibition of envy, but also 
provides valuable guidance for developing mindfulness-based intervention 
programs aiming at reducing the negative effects of envy.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review aims to demonstrate how natural language 
processing is used in orthopaedic research.
RECENT FINDINGS: Natural language processing is a form of artificial 
intelligence that involves encoding human-generated text or speech into a form 
which can be interpreted by computers to perform a variety of tasks. Natural 
language processing gathers, processes, and organizes large amounts of free-text 
data more efficiently than humans. In orthopaedics, it has been utilized for 
retrospective chart review, automated reporting of electronic health record 
data, analyzing operative notes and radiology reports, and patient reviews of 
physicians and practices. Although still in its infancy, natural language 
processing promises to be a valuable tool in the future of orthopaedic research. 
It will not eliminate the need for the essential human component of questioning 
involved in research, but natural language processing can improve the quality, 
efficiency, and thoroughness of research, thus improving patient care.

IVF techniques have changed over time with the aim of improving clinical 
results. Today, embryology is facing a change common to most areas of medicine, 
the introduction of automation. The use of automated systems in the IVF 
laboratory is already happening, for example, with electronic witnessing and the 
ranking of embryos according to their implantation potential. It is expected 
that in the near future, various systems in the IVF laboratory will be 
automated. In this way, gamete manipulation would cease to be manual and embryo 
culture and selection would be performed by means of microfluidics and 
artificial intelligence. Therefore, the tasks of the embryologist will 
inevitably be reduced. However, new functions related to data capture, 
management and analysis will emerge, along with other research skills and 
increased communication with other professionals and patients.

OBJECTIVE: The long-term impact of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) 
exposure on offspring health is an emerging research area. The objective of this 
study was to evaluate the association between a maternal diagnosis of HDP 
(gestational hypertension and preeclampsia) and adverse neurodevelopmental 
outcomes in the offspring.
STUDY DESIGN: This was a secondary analysis of two parallel multicenter clinical 
trials of thyroxine therapy for subclinical hypothyroid disorders in pregnancy. 
Women with singleton nonanomalous gestations diagnosed with subclinical 
hypothyroidism or hypothyroxinemia were randomized to thyroxine therapy or 
placebo. The primary outcome was child intelligence quotient (IQ) at 5 years of 
age. Secondary outcomes included several neurodevelopmental measures, including 
the Bayley-III cognitive, motor, and language scores at 12 and 24 months, 
Differential Ability Scales-II (DAS-II) scores at 36 months, the Conners' rating 
scales-revised at 48 months, and scores from the Child Behavior Checklist at 36 
and 60 months. Thyroxine therapy did not influence neurodevelopment in either of 
the primary studies. Associations between neurodevelopment outcomes and maternal 
HDP were examined using univariable and multivariable analyses.
RESULTS: A total of 112 woman-child dyads with HDP were compared with 1,067 
woman-child dyads without HDP. In univariable analysis, mean maternal age 
(26.7 ± 5.9 vs. 27.8 ± 5.7 years, p = 0.032) and the frequency of nulliparity 
(45.5 vs. 31.0%, p = 0.002) differed significantly between the two groups. 
Maternal socioeconomic characteristics did not differ between the groups. After 
adjusting for potential confounders, there were no significant differences in 
any primary or secondary neurodevelopment outcome between offspring exposed to 
HDP and those unexposed. However, when dichotomized as low or high scores, we 
found higher rates of language delay (language scores <85: -1 standard 
deviation) at 2 years of age among offspring exposed to HDP compared with those 
unexposed (46.5 vs. 30.5%, adjusted odds ratio = 2.22, 95% confidence interval 
[CI]: 1.44-3.42).
CONCLUSION: In this cohort of pregnant women, HDP diagnosis was associated with 
language delay at 2 years of age. However, other long-term neurodevelopmental 
outcomes in offspring were not associated with HDP.
KEY POINTS: · No differences were found in neurodevelopment between offspring 
exposed to HDP and controls.. · Higher rates of language delay at 2 years of age 
were found in offspring exposed to HDP.. · The results did not differ when 
analysis was stratified by preterm birth..

Objective. Alzheimer's disease (AD), a common disease of the elderly with 
unknown etiology, has been adversely affecting many people, especially with the 
aging of the population and the younger trend of this disease. Current 
artificial intelligence (AI) methods based on individual information or magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) can solve the problem of diagnostic sensitivity and 
specificity, but still face the challenges of interpretability and clinical 
feasibility. In this study, we propose an interpretable multimodal deep 
reinforcement learning model for inferring pathological features and the 
diagnosis of AD.Approach. First, for better clinical feasibility, the 
compressed-sensing MRI image is reconstructed using an interpretable deep 
reinforcement learning model. Then, the reconstructed MRI is input into the full 
convolution neural network to generate a pixel-level disease probability risk 
map (DPM) of the whole brain for AD. The DPM of important brain regions and 
individual information are then input into the attention-based fully deep neural 
network to obtain the diagnosis results and analyze the biomarkers. We used 1349 
multi-center samples to construct and test the model.Main results.Finally, the 
model obtained 99.6% ± 0.2%, 97.9% ± 0.2%, and 96.1% ± 0.3% area under curve in 
ADNI, AIBL and NACC, respectively. The model also provides an effective analysis 
of multimodal pathology, predicts the imaging biomarkers in MRI and the weight 
of each individual item of information. In this study, a deep reinforcement 
learning model was designed, which can not only accurately diagnose AD, but 
analyze potential biomarkers.Significance. In this study, a deep reinforcement 
learning model was designed. The model builds a bridge between clinical practice 
and AI diagnosis and provides a viewpoint for the interpretability of AI 
technology.

Association of BDNF levels with IQ: comparison of S100B and BDNF levels in 
typically developing children and subjects with neurologically normal 
nonsyndromic intellectual disability.

University, Ordu, Turkey.

BACKGROUND: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and S100B are reported to 
play an important role in neurodevelopment and may contribute to developmental 
pathogenesis in neuropsychiatric diseases. In this study, we aimed to examine 
the possible roles of BDNF and S100B in the pathogenesis of nonsyndromic 
intellectual disability (NS-ID) and their relationship with cognitive 
performance.
METHODS: Thirty-three patients with intellectual disability (ID) and 30 
typically developing children were compared. BDNF and S100B serum levels were 
measured with ELISA. The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised Short 
form (WISC-R) and Leiter intelligence test were administered to determine the 
intelligence levels of subjects. Leiter intelligence test was applied to 10 
participants (30.31%) in the ID group because they had speech and communication 
problems. All other participants underwent WISC-R.
RESULTS: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels were found to be significantly 
low in the patient group (mean ± SD, 67.43 ± 29.74 pg/mL) compared with the 
control group (94.67 ± 32.55 pg/mL) (P = 0.002). When S100B is assessed, there 
was no significant difference found between the patient group 
(335.05 ± 279.89 pg/mL) and control group (295.30 ± 146.55 pg/mL) (P = 0.901). 
There was a significant positive correlation between BDNF and performance IQ 
(r = 0.424 and P = 0.001) in all participants. In addition, positive 
correlations were found between BDNF levels and initiating speech time 
(r = -0.369 and P = 0.003).
CONCLUSIONS: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor deficiency is proposed to have a 
possible role in the pathology of NS-ID. High BDNF levels may be associated with 
better cognitive performance.

Pandemics past, present, and future: Their impact on oral health care.

Samaranayake L, Fakhruddin KS.

BACKGROUND: Pandemics have significantly modified our societal behaviour over 
the millennia, and the COVID-19 pandemic is no exception.
TYPES OF ARTICLES REVIEWED: In this article, the authors review the history of 
pandemics, the probable reasons for their emergence, and the COVID-19 pandemic 
due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its 
variants, as well as its possible impact on dentistry during the postpandemic 
period.
RESULTS: There are multiple reasons why catastrophic pandemics occur due to new 
infectious organisms that cross the species barrier from animals to humans. 
These include, population explosion, mass migration, and prolonged survival of 
debilitated and susceptible cohorts on various immunosuppressants. Coupled with 
global warming and the resultant loss of habitats, such vicissitudes of humans 
and nature lead to microbes evolving and mutating at an exponential pace, paving 
the way for pandemics. The contemporary epidemics and pandemics beginning with 
the HIV pandemic have modulated dentistry beyond recognition, now with assiduous 
and robust infection control measures in place.
CONCLUSIONS AND PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Because COVID-19 may become an endemic 
disease, particularly due to emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants the dental community 
should adopt modified infection control measures, teledentistry, and 
point-of-care diagnostics, among other measures. It is likely, that clinical 
ecosystems in future would be rendered even safer by predicting how pathogens 
evolve and priming the human immune system for the next wave of microbial 
combatants through vaccines produced using deep mutational scanning in which 
artificial intelligence and machine learning can predict the next variants even 
before their arrival.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to identify patients with major depressive disorder 
(MDD) by developing different machine learning (ML) models based on tryptophan 
hydroxylase-2 (TPH2) methylation and environmental stress.
METHODS: The data were collected from 291 patients with MDD and 100 healthy 
control participants: individual basic information, the Negative Life Events 
Scale (NLES) scores, the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) scores and the 
methylation level at 38 CpG sites in TPH2. Information gain was used to select 
critical input variables. Support vector machine (SVM), back propagation neural 
network (BPNN) and random forest (RF) algorithms were used to build recognition 
models, which were evaluated by the 10-fold cross-validation. SHapley Additive 
exPlanations (SHAP) method was used to evaluate features importance.
RESULTS: Gender, NLES scores, CTQ scores and 13 CpG sites in TPH2 gene were 
considered as predictors in the models. Three ML algorithms showed satisfactory 
performance in predicting MDD and the BPNN model indicated best prediction 
effects.
CONCLUSION: ML models with TPH2 methylation and environmental stress were 
identified to possess great performance in identifying patients with MDD, which 
provided precious experience for artificial intelligence to assist traditional 
diagnostic methods in the future.

Food recognition systems recently garnered much research attention in the 
relevant field due to their ability to obtain objective measurements for dietary 
intake. This feature contributes to the management of various chronic 
conditions. Challenges such as inter and intraclass variations alongside the 
practical applications of smart glasses, wearable cameras, and mobile devices 
require resource-efficient food recognition models with high classification 
performance. Furthermore, explainable AI is also crucial in health-related 
domains as it characterizes model performance, enhancing its transparency and 
objectivity. Our proposed architecture attempts to address these challenges by 
drawing on the strengths of the transfer learning technique upon initializing 
MobiletNetV3 with weights from a pre-trained model of ImageNet. The MobileNetV3 
achieves superior performance using the squeeze and excitation strategy, 
providing unequal weight to different input channels and contrasting equal 
weights in other variants. Despite being fast and efficient, there is a high 
possibility for it to be stuck in the local optima like other deep neural 
networks, reducing the desired classification performance of the model. Thus, we 
overcome this issue by applying the snapshot ensemble approach as it enables the 
M model in a single training process without any increase in the required 
training time. As a result, each snapshot in the ensemble visits different local 
minima before converging to the final solution which enhances recognition 
performance. On overcoming the challenge of explainability, we argue that 
explanations cannot be monolithic, since each stakeholder perceive the results', 
explanations based on different objectives and aims. Thus, we proposed a 
user-centered explainable artificial intelligence (AI) framework to increase the 
trust of the involved parties by inferencing and rationalizing the results 
according to needs and user profile. Our framework is comprehensive in terms of 
a dietary assessment app as it detects Food/Non-Food, food categories, and 
ingredients. Experimental results on the standard food benchmarks and newly 
contributed Malaysian food dataset for ingredient detection demonstrated 
superior performance on an integrated set of measures over other methodologies.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To validate a computed tomography (CT)-based deep 
learning prognostication model, originally developed for a surgical cohort, in 
patients with primary lung cancer undergoing stereotactic ablative radiotherapy 
(SABR).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study identified patients with 
clinical stage T1-2N0M0 lung cancer treated with SABR between 2013 and 2018. The 
outcomes were local recurrence-free survival (LRFS), disease-free survival 
(DFS), and overall survival (OS). The discrimination performance of the model, 
which extracted a quantitative score of cumulative risk for an adverse event up 
to 900 days, was evaluated using time-dependent receiver operating 
characteristic curve analysis. Multivariable Cox regression was performed to 
investigate the independent prognostic value of the model output adjusting for 
clinical factors including age, sex, smoking status, and clinical T category.
RESULTS: In total, 135 patients (median age, 78 years; 101 men; 78 [57.8%] 
adenocarcinomas and 57 [42.2%] squamous cell carcinomas) were evaluated. Most 
patients (117/135) were treated with 48-60 Gy in four fractions. Median 
biologically effective dose was 150.0 Gy (interquartile range, 126.9, 150.0 Gy). 
For LRFS, the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.72 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 
0.58, 0.87). The AUCs were 0.70 (95% CI: 0.60, 0.81) for DFS and 0.66 (95% CI: 
0.54, 0.77) for OS. Model output was associated with LRFS (adjusted hazard ratio 
[HR], 1.043; 95% CI: 1.003, 1.085; P = 0.04), DFS (adjusted HR, 1.03; 95% CI: 
1.01, 1.05; P = 0.008), and OS (adjusted HR, 1.025; 95% CI: 1.002, 1.047; 
P = 0.03).
CONCLUSION: This study showed external validity and transportability of the 
CT-based deep learning prognostication model for radiotherapy candidates.

OBJECTIVES: There is uncertainty regarding the efficacy of artificial 
intelligence (AI) software to detect advanced subtle neoplasia, particularly 
flat lesions and sessile serrated lesions (SSLs), due to low prevalence in 
testing datasets and prospective trials. This has been highlighted as a top 
research priority for the field.
METHODS: An AI algorithm was evaluated on four video test datasets containing 
173 polyps (35,114 polyp-positive frames and 634,988 polyp-negative frames) 
specifically enriched with flat lesions and SSLs, including a challenging 
dataset containing subtle advanced neoplasia. The challenging dataset was also 
evaluated by eight endoscopists (four independent, four trainees, according to 
the Joint Advisory Group on gastrointestinal endoscopy [JAG] standards in the 
UK).
RESULTS: In the first two video datasets, the algorithm achieved per-polyp 
sensitivities of 100% and 98.9%. Per-frame sensitivities were 84.1% and 85.2%. 
In the subtle dataset, the algorithm detected a significantly higher number of 
polyps (P < 0.0001), compared to JAG-independent and trainee endoscopists, 
achieving per-polyp sensitivities of 79.5%, 37.2% and 11.5%, respectively. 
Furthermore, when considering subtle polyps detected by both the algorithm and 
at least one endoscopist, the AI detected polyps significantly faster on 
average.
CONCLUSIONS: The AI based algorithm achieved high per-polyp sensitivities for 
advanced colorectal neoplasia, including flat lesions and SSLs, outperforming 
both JAG independent and trainees on a very challenging dataset containing 
subtle lesions that could have been overlooked easily and contribute to interval 
colorectal cancer. Further prospective trials should evaluate AI to detect 
subtle advanced neoplasia in higher risk populations for colorectal cancer.

Background: Diagnosing pediatric appendicitis by ultrasonography (US) is 
difficult because US requires significant training and skill. We evaluated 
whether artificial intelligence (AI) can augment US. Materials and Methods: 
Among 70 abdominal ultrasound videos containing 85-347 images each, 50 were used 
to train the AI neural network. Each video was categorized based on the 
detection percentage and percent accuracy: most (>50%), partial (10-50%), and 
none (<10%). Test 1 involved verification of appendix detection by AI using the 
remaining 20 videos. Test 2 involved the evaluation of the effect of AI 
utilization on pediatricians. Results: From 50 videos, 6914 images were used to 
train the AI network. In test 1, 3 pediatric surgeons judged 10 (50.0%), 4 
(20.0%), and 6 (30.0%) videos as "most," "partial," and "none," respectively, 
regarding the detection percentage; 7 (35.0%), 7 (35.0%), and 6 (30.0%) videos 
were judged, respectively, concerning the percent accuracy. Five (83.3%) of six 
test videos with a scan area depth of 8 cm were judged as "none" for both 
detection and accuracy. In test 2, six videos were also judged as "none" for 
both categories, showing a negative effect on the participants (5 pediatric 
residents and 5 pediatric intensive-emergency fellows), but the other categories 
showed little negative effect. Conclusions: Appendicitis in a shallow US scan 
area can be easily identified with AI support. Even with the detection of a 
partial appendicitis shadow, AI is still helpful. However, if AI does not detect 
appendicitis at all, examiners may be negatively affected.

INTRODUCTION: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common sleep disorder with 
multiple comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular 
disorders. Detected based on an overnight sleep study is called polysomnography 
(PSG); OSA still remains undiagnosed in majority of the population mainly 
attributed to lack of awareness. To overcome the limitations posed by PSG such 
as patient discomfort and overnight hospitalization, newer technologies are 
being explored. In addition, challenges associated with current management of 
OSA using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), etc. presents several 
pitfalls.
AREAS COVERED: Conventional and modern detection/management techniques including 
PSG, CPAP, smart wearable/pillows, bio-motion sensors, etc., have both pros and 
cons. To fulfill the limitations in OSA diagnostics, there is an imperative need 
for new technology for screening of symptomatic and more importantly 
asymptomatic OSA patients to reduce the risk of several associated 
life-threatening comorbidities. In this line, molecular marker-based diagnostics 
have shown great promises.
EXPERT OPINION: A detailed overview is presented on the OSA management and 
diagnostic approaches and recent advances in the molecular screening methods. 
The potentials of biomarker-based detection and its limitations are also 
portrayed and a comparison between the standard, current modern approaches, and 
promising futuristic technologies for OSA diagnostics and management is set 
forth.ABBREVIATIONS AHI: Apnea hypopnea index; AI: artificial intelligence; CAM:

Global projections on the climate change and the dynamic environmental 
perturbations indicate severe impacts on food security in general, and crop 
yield, vigor and the quality of produce in particular. Sessile plants respond to 
environmental challenges such as salt, drought, temperature, heavy metals at 
transcriptional and/or post-transcriptional levels through the stress-regulated 
network of pathways including transcription factors, proteins and the small 
non-coding endogenous RNAs. Amongs these, the miRNAs have gained unprecedented 
attention in recent years as key regulators for modulating gene expression in 
plants under stress. Hence, tailoring of miRNAs and their target pathways 
presents a promising strategy for developing multiple stress-tolerant crops. 
Plant stress tolerance has been successfully achieved through the over 
expression of microRNAs such as Os-miR408, Hv-miR82 for drought tolerance; 
OsmiR535A and artificial DST miRNA for salinity tolerance; and OsmiR535 and 
miR156 for combined drought and salt stress. Examples of miR408 overexpression 
also showed improved efficiency of irradiation utilization and carbon dioxide 
fixation in crop plants. Through this review, we present the current 
understanding about plant miRNAs, their roles in plant growth and 
stress-responses, the modern toolbox for identification, characterization and 
validation of miRNAs and their target genes including in silico tools, machine 
learning and artificial intelligence. Various approaches for up-regulation or 
knock-out of miRNAs have been discussed. The main emphasis has been given to the 
exploration of miRNAs for development of bioengineered climate-smart crops that 
can withstand changing climates and stressful environments, including 
combination of stresses, with very less or no yield penalties.

Skin cancer remains the most commonly diagnosed cancer in the USA with more than 
1 million new cases each year. Melanomas account for about 1% of all skin 
cancers and most skin cancer deaths. Multiethnic individuals whose skin is 
pigmented underestimate their risk for skin cancers and melanomas and may delay 
seeking a diagnosis. The use of artificial intelligence may help improve the 
diagnostic precision of dermatologists/physicians to identify malignant lesions. 
To validate our artificial intelligence's efficiency in distinguishing between 
images, we utilized 50 images obtained from our International Skin Imaging 
Collaboration dataset (n = 25) and pathologically confirmed lesions (n = 25). We 
compared the ability of our artificial intelligence to visually diagnose these 
50 skin cancer lesions with a panel of three dermatologists. The artificial 
intelligence model better differentiated between melanoma vs. nonmelanoma with 
an area under the curve of 0.948. The three-panel member dermatologists 
correctly diagnosed a similar number of images (n = 35) as the artificial 
intelligence program (n = 34). Fleiss' kappa (ĸ) score for the raters and 
artificial intelligence indicated fair (0.247) agreement. However, the combined 
result of the dermatologists panel with the artificial intelligence assessments 
correctly identified 100% of the images from the test data set. Our artificial 
intelligence platform was able to utilize visual images to discriminate melanoma 
from nonmelanoma, using de-identified images. The combined results of the 
artificial intelligence with those of the dermatologists support the use of 
artificial intelligence as an efficient lesion assessment strategy to reduce 
time and expense in diagnoses to reduce delays in treatment.

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are often selected from antigen-specific single B 
cells derived from different hosts, which are notably short-lived in ex vivo 
culture conditions and hence, arduous to interrogate. The development of several 
new techniques and protocols has facilitated the isolation and retrieval of 
antibody-coding sequences of antigen-specific B cells by also leveraging 
miniaturization of reaction volumes. Alternatively, mAbs can be generated 
independently of antigen-specific B cells, comprising display technologies and, 
more recently, artificial intelligence-driven algorithms. Consequently, a 
considerable variety of techniques are used, raising the demand for better 
consolidation. In this review, we present and discuss the major techniques 
available to interrogate antigen-specific single B cells to isolate 
antigen-specific mAbs, including their main advantages and disadvantages.

BACKGROUND: Experimental data have shown that the developing brain is especially 
vulnerable to exogenous noxious substances. The potential effects of anesthetic 
drugs on brain growth and development are a matter of concern. Clinical studies 
of children who underwent general anesthesia in their earliest years can make a 
major contribution to our understanding of the effects of anesthetic drugs on 
infants and toddlers (i.e., children under age 5).
METHODS: Children born at term during the years 2007-2011 who were exposed to 
general anesthesia before their third birthday were included in the study. Data 
on general anesthesia were retrospectively evaluated, and the overall 
intelligence quotient (IQ) was determined prospectively as the primary target 
parameter. Children who had not been exposed to general anesthesia were 
recruited as a control group. The non-inferiority threshold was set at a 
difference of 5 IQ points out of a consideration of clinical relevance.
RESULTS: 430 complete data sets were available from exposed children and 67 from 
members of the control group. The exposed group achieved a mean IQ score of 
108.2, with a 95% confidence interval of [107; 109.4]; the corresponding values 
in the control group were 113 [110; 116.1]. Both groups achieved a mean score 
that was higher than the expected 100 points. After adjustment for age, 
socioeconomic status, and sex, the difference between the two groups was 2.9 
points [0.2; 5.6], indicating a significantly better outcome in the control 
group than in the exposed group. The non-inferiority threshold of 5 IQ points 
was within the confidence interval; thus, non-inferiority was not demonstrated.
CONCLUSION: The fact that both groups achieved a higher IQ score than the 
expected 100 points may be attributable, at least in part, to the restriction of 
the study to children born at term. The results indicate that general anesthesia 
in early childhood is not associated with markedly reduced intelligence in later 
years, although noninferiority could not be demonstrated.

Many languages use the same letters to represent different sounds (e.g., the 
letter P represents /p/ in English but /r/ in Russian). We report two 
experiments that examine how native language experience impacts the acquisition 
and processing of words with conflicting letter-to-sound mappings. Experiment 1 
revealed that individual differences in nonverbal intelligence predicted word 
learning and that novel words with conflicting orthography-to-phonology mappings 
were harder to learn when their spelling was more typical of the native language 
than less typical (due to increased competition from the native language). 
Notably, Experiment 2 used eye tracking to reveal, for the first time, that 
hearing non-native spoken words activates native language orthography and both 
native and non-native letter-to-sound mappings. These findings evince high 
interactivity in the language system, illustrate the role of orthography in 
phonological learning and processing, and demonstrate that experience with 
written form changes the linguistic mind.

BACKGROUND: Advancements based on artificial intelligence have emerged in all 
areas of medicine. Many decisions in organ transplantation can now potentially 
be addressed in a more precise manner with the aid of artificial intelligence.
METHOD/RESULTS: All elements of liver transplantation consist of a set of input 
variables and a set of output variables. Artificial intelligence identifies 
relationships between the input variables; that is, how they select the data 
groups to train patterns and how they can predict the potential outcomes of the 
output variables. The most widely used classifiers to address the different 
aspects of liver transplantation are artificial neural networks, decision tree 
classifiers, random forest, and naïve Bayes classification models. Artificial 
intelligence applications are being evaluated in liver transplantation, 
especially in organ allocation, donor-recipient matching, survival prediction 
analysis, and transplant oncology.
CONCLUSION: In the years to come, deep learning-based models will be used by 
liver transplant experts to support their decisions, especially in areas where 
securing equitability in the transplant process needs to be optimized.

Although significant advancements in computer-aided diagnostics using artificial 
intelligence (AI) have been made, to date, no viable method for 
radiation-induced skin reaction (RISR) analysis and classification is available. 
The objective of this single-center study was to develop machine learning and 
deep learning approaches using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for 
automatic classification of RISRs according to the Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grading system. ScarletredⓇ Vision, a novel and 
state-of-the-art digital skin imaging method capable of remote monitoring and 
objective assessment of acute RISRs was used to convert 2D digital skin images 
using the CIELAB color space and conduct SEV* measurements. A set of different 
machine learning and deep convolutional neural network-based algorithms has been 
explored for the automatic classification of RISRs. A total of 2263 distinct 
images from 209 patients were analyzed for training and testing the machine 
learning and CNN algorithms. For a 2-class problem of healthy skin (grade 0) 
versus erythema (grade ≥ 1), all machine learning models produced an accuracy of 
above 70%, and the sensitivity and specificity of erythema recognition were 
67-72% and 72-83%, respectively. The CNN produced a test accuracy of 74%, 
sensitivity of 66%, and specificity of 83% for predicting healthy and erythema 
cases. For the severity grade prediction of a 3-class problem (grade 0 versus 1 
versus 2), the overall test accuracy was 60-67%, and the sensitivities were 
56-82%, 35-59%, and 65-72%, respectively. For estimating the severity grade of 
each class, the CNN obtained an accuracy of 73%, 66%, and 82%, respectively. 
Ensemble learning combines several individual predictions to obtain a better 
generalization performance. Furthermore, we exploited ensemble learning by 
deploying a CNN model as a meta-learner. The ensemble CNN based on bagging and 
majority voting shows an accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 87%, 90%, and 
82% for a 2-class problem, respectively. For a 3-class problem, the ensemble CNN 
shows an overall accuracy of 66%, while for each grade (0, 1, and 2) accuracies 
were 76%, 69%, and 87%, sensitivities were 70%, 57%, and 71%, and specificities 
were 78%, 75%, and 95%, respectively. This study is the first to focus on 
erythema in radiation-dermatitis and produces benchmark results using machine 
learning models. The outcome of this study validates that the proposed system 
can act as a pre-screening and decision support tool for oncologists or patients 
to provide fast, reliable, and efficient assessment of erythema grading.

The spread of early-stage (T1 and T2) adenocarcinomas to locoregional lymph 
nodes is a key event in disease progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). The 
cellular mechanisms behind this event are not completely understood and existing 
predictive biomarkers are imperfect. Here, we used an end-to-end deep learning 
algorithm to identify risk factors for lymph node metastasis (LNM) status in 
digitized histopathology slides of the primary CRC and its surrounding tissue. 
In two large population-based cohorts, we show that this system can predict the 
presence of more than one LNM in pT2 CRC patients with an area under the 
receiver operating curve (AUROC) of 0.733 (0.67-0.758) and patients with any LNM 
with an AUROC of 0.711 (0.597-0.797). Similarly, in pT1 CRC patients, the 
presence of more than one LNM or any LNM was predictable with an AUROC of 0.733 
(0.644-0.778) and 0.567 (0.542-0.597), respectively. Based on these findings, we 
used the deep learning system to guide human pathology experts towards highly 
predictive regions for LNM in the whole slide images. This hybrid human observer 
and deep learning approach identified inflamed adipose tissue as the highest 
predictive feature for LNM presence. Our study is a first proof of concept that 
artificial intelligence (AI) systems may be able to discover potentially new 
biological mechanisms in cancer progression. Our deep learning algorithm is 
publicly available and can be used for biomarker discovery in any disease 
setting. © 2021 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland. Published

Accurate diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) followed by effective 
rehabilitation is essential for the management of this disorder. Artificial 
intelligence (AI) techniques can aid physicians to apply automatic diagnosis and 
rehabilitation procedures. AI techniques comprise traditional machine learning 
(ML) approaches and deep learning (DL) techniques. Conventional ML methods 
employ various feature extraction and classification techniques, but in DL, the 
process of feature extraction and classification is accomplished intelligently 
and integrally. DL methods for diagnosis of ASD have been focused on 
neuroimaging-based approaches. Neuroimaging techniques are non-invasive disease 
markers potentially useful for ASD diagnosis. Structural and functional 
neuroimaging techniques provide physicians substantial information about the 
structure (anatomy and structural connectivity) and function (activity and 
functional connectivity) of the brain. Due to the intricate structure and 
function of the brain, proposing optimum procedures for ASD diagnosis with 
neuroimaging data without exploiting powerful AI techniques like DL may be 
challenging. In this paper, studies conducted with the aid of DL networks to 
distinguish ASD are investigated. Rehabilitation tools provided for supporting 
ASD patients utilizing DL networks are also assessed. Finally, we will present 
important challenges in the automated detection and rehabilitation of ASD and 
propose some future works.

Development of neural interface and brain-machine interface (BMI) systems 
enables the treatment of neurological disorders including cognitive, sensory, 
and motor dysfunctions. While neural interfaces have steadily decreased in form 
factor, recent developments target pervasive implantables. Along with advances 
in electrodes, neural recording, and neurostimulation circuits, integration of 
disease biomarkers and machine learning algorithms enables real-time and on-site 
processing of neural activity with no need for power-demanding telemetry. This 
recent trend on combining artificial intelligence and machine learning with 
modern neural interfaces will lead to a new generation of low-power, smart, and 
miniaturized therapeutic devices for a wide range of neurological and 
psychiatric disorders. This paper reviews the recent development of the 
'on-chip' machine learning and neuromorphic architectures, which is one of the 
key puzzles in devising next-generation clinically viable neural interface 
systems.

Social interaction is thought to provide a selection pressure for human 
intelligence, yet little is known about its neurobiological basis and evolution 
throughout the primate lineage. Recent advances in neuroimaging have enabled 
whole brain investigation of brain structure, function, and connectivity in 
humans and non-human primates (NHPs), leading to a nascent field of comparative 
connectomics. However, linking social behavior to brain organization across the 
primates remains challenging. Here, we review the current understanding of the 
macroscale neural mechanisms of social behaviors from the viewpoint of system 
neuroscience. We first demonstrate an association between the number of cortical 
neurons and the size of social groups across primates, suggesting a link between 
neural information-processing capacity and social capabilities. Moreover, by 
capitalizing on recent advances in species-harmonized functional MRI, we 
demonstrate that portions of the mirror neuron system and default-mode networks, 
which are thought to be important for representation of the other's actions and 
sense of self, respectively, exhibit similarities in functional organization in 
macaque monkeys and humans, suggesting possible homologies. With respect to 
these two networks, we describe recent developments in the neurobiology of 
social perception, joint attention, personality and social complexity. Together, 
the Human Connectome Project (HCP)-style comparative neuroimaging, 
hyperscanning, behavioral, and other multi-modal investigations are expected to 
yield important insights into the evolutionary foundations of human social 
behavior.

The identification of different meat cuts for labeling and quality control on 
production lines is still largely a manual process. As a result, it is a 
labor-intensive exercise with the potential for not only error but also 
bacterial cross-contamination. Artificial intelligence is used in many 
disciplines to identify objects within images, but these approaches usually 
require a considerable volume of images for training and validation. The 
objective of this study was to identify five different meat cuts from images and 
weights collected by a trained operator within the working environment of a 
commercial Irish beef plant. Individual cut images and weights from 7,987 meats 
cuts extracted from semimembranosus muscles (i.e., Topside muscle), post 
editing, were available. A variety of classical neural networks and a novel 
Ensemble machine learning approaches were then tasked with identifying each 
individual meat cut; performance of the approaches was dictated by accuracy (the 
percentage of correct predictions), precision (the ratio of correctly predicted 
objects relative to the number of objects identified as positive), and recall 
(also known as true positive rate or sensitivity). A novel Ensemble approach 
outperformed a selection of the classical neural networks including 
convolutional neural network and residual network. The accuracy, precision, and 
recall for the novel Ensemble method were 99.13%, 99.00%, and 98.00%, 
respectively, while that of the next best method were 98.00%, 98.00%, and 
95.00%, respectively. The Ensemble approach, which requires relatively few 
gold-standard measures, can readily be deployed under normal abattoir 
conditions; the strategy could also be evaluated in the cuts from other primals 
or indeed other species.

In the era of data-driven medicine, rapid access and accurate interpretation of 
medical images are becoming increasingly important. The DICOM Image ANalysis and 
Archive (DIANA) system is an open-source, lightweight, and scalable Python 
interface that enables users to interact with hospital Picture Archiving and 
Communications Systems (PACS) to access such data. In this work, DIANA 
functionality was detailed and evaluated in the context of retrospective PACS 
data retrieval and two prospective clinical artificial intelligence (AI) 
pipelines: bone age (BA) estimation and intra-cranial hemorrhage (ICH) 
detection. DIANA orchestrates activity beginning with post-acquisition study 
discovery and ending with online notifications of findings. For AI applications, 
system latency (exam completion to system report time) was quantified and 
compared to that of clinicians (exam completion to initial report creation 
time). Mean DIANA latency was 9.04 ± 3.83 and 20.17 ± 10.16 min compared to 
clinician latency of 51.52 ± 58.9 and 65.62 ± 110.39 min for BA and ICH, 
respectively, with DIANA latencies being significantly lower (p < 0.001). 
DIANA's capabilities were also explored and found effective in retrieving and 
anonymizing protected health information for "big-data" medical imaging research 
and analysis. Mean per-image retrieval times were 1.12 ± 0.50 and 0.08 ± 0.01 s 
across x-ray and computed tomography studies, respectively. The data herein 
demonstrate that DIANA can flexibly integrate into existing hospital 
infrastructure and improve the process by which researchers/clinicians access 
imaging repository data. This results in a simplified workflow for large data 
retrieval and clinical integration of AI models.

OBJECTIVES: This systematic review aims to examine the effectiveness of online 
mental health interventions for youth.
METHODS: We searched seven electronic databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Medline, 
Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science and SCOPUS) for the past 10 years to identify 
randomized controlled trials which have evaluated the use of telehealth 
interventions for young people with mental health problems. The included studies 
were assessed for quality and risk of bias.
RESULTS: Forty-five randomized controlled trials (n = 13,291 participants) were 
eligible for this review. Most studies (35 trials) evaluated the use of 
web-based self-help platforms to deliver cognitive behavioural therapy (14 
trials), mindfulness (four trials), acceptance commitment therapy (five trials) 
and positive psychology (two trials). Mobile/computer applications were used to 
deliver cognitive behavioural therapy (four trials) and coping strategies 
training (two trials). Web-based synchronous chat (one trial) was used to assist 
communication between counsellors and participants. Three studies used 
artificial intelligence-based conversational agents to deliver cognitive 
behavioural therapy (two trials) and problem-solving-strategy training (one 
trial). Eighty-two percent (n = 37) identified the participants as student 
population (i.e. university students, high school students). Sixty-four percent 
(n = 29) of the telehealth interventions were found to be effective in managing 
depression, anxiety, stress, insomnia and improving quality of life when 
compared with control conditions.
CONCLUSIONS: Online mental health interventions were found to be effective in 
managing diverse mental health conditions among youth. Online self-help 
platforms were the most frequently used modality and artificial 
intelligence-based chatbots are merging as potential solutions. Future research 
is warranted to investigate the solutions to improve the retention rate and 
satisfaction of telehealth interventions among this population.

Use of artificial intelligence in healthcare, such as machine learning-based 
predictive algorithms, holds promise for advancing outcomes, but few systems are 
used in routine clinical practice. Trust has been cited as an important 
challenge to meaningful use of artificial intelligence in clinical practice. 
Artificial intelligence systems often involve automating cognitively challenging 
tasks. Therefore, previous literature on trust in automation may hold important 
lessons for artificial intelligence applications in healthcare. In this 
perspective, we argue that informatics should take lessons from literature on 
trust in automation such that the goal should be to foster appropriate trust in 
artificial intelligence based on the purpose of the tool, its process for making 
recommendations, and its performance in the given context. We adapt a conceptual 
model to support this argument and present recommendations for future work.

The advent of deep learning has engendered renewed and rapidly growing interest 
in artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology to analyze images, manipulate 
textual reports, and plan interventions. Applications of deep learning and other 
AI approaches must be guided by sound medical knowledge to assure that they are 
developed successfully and that they address important problems in biomedical 
research or patient care. To date, AI has been applied to a limited number of 
real-world radiology applications. As AI systems become more pervasive and are 
applied more broadly, they will benefit from medical knowledge on a larger 
scale, such as that available through computer-based approaches. A key approach 
to represent computer-based knowledge in a particular domain is an ontology. As 
defined in informatics, an ontology defines a domain's terms through their 
relationships with other terms in the ontology. Those relationships, then, 
define the terms' semantics, or "meaning." Biomedical ontologies commonly define 
the relationships between terms and more general terms, and can express causal, 
part-whole, and anatomic relationships. Ontologies express knowledge in a form 
that is both human-readable and machine-computable. Some ontologies, such as 
RSNA's RadLex radiology lexicon, have been applied to applications in clinical 
practice and research, and may be familiar to many radiologists. This article 
describes how ontologies can support research and guide emerging applications of 
AI in radiology, including natural language processing, image-based machine 
learning, radiomics, and planning.

Visual Evaluation for Autonomous Driving.

Hou Y, Wang C, Wang J, Xue X, Zhang XL, Zhu J, Wang D, Chen S.

Autonomous driving technologies often use state-of-the-art artificial 
intelligence algorithms to understand the relationship between the vehicle and 
the external environment, to predict the changes of the environment, and then to 
plan and control the behaviors of the vehicle accordingly. The complexity of 
such technologies makes it challenging to evaluate the performance of autonomous 
driving systems and to find ways to improve them. The current approaches to 
evaluating such autonomous driving systems largely use a single score to 
indicate the overall performance of a system, but domain experts have 
difficulties in understanding how individual components or algorithms in an 
autonomous driving system may contribute to the score. To address this problem, 
we collaborate with domain experts on autonomous driving algorithms, and propose 
a visual evaluation method for autonomous driving. Our method considers the data 
generated in all components during the whole process of autonomous driving, 
including perception results, planning routes, prediction of obstacles, various 
controlling parameters, and evaluation of comfort. We develop a visual analytics 
workflow to integrate an evaluation mathematical model with adjustable 
parameters, support the evaluation of the system from the level of the overall 
performance to the level of detailed measures of individual components, and to 
show both evaluation scores and their contributing factors. Our implemented 
visual analytics system provides an overview evaluation score at the beginning 
and shows the animation of the dynamic change of the scores at each period. 
Experts can interactively explore the specific component at different time 
periods and identify related factors. With our method, domain experts not only 
learn about the performance of an autonomous driving system, but also identify 
and access the problematic parts of each component. Our visual evaluation system 
can be applied to the autonomous driving simulation system and used for various 
evaluation cases. The results of using our system in some simulation cases and 
the feedback from involved domain experts confirm the usefulness and efficiency 
of our method in helping people gain in-depth insight into autonomous driving 
systems.

The response to neoadjuvant therapy can vary widely between individual patients. 
Histopathological tumor regression grading (TRG) is a strong factor for 
treatment response and survival prognosis of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) 
patients following neoadjuvant treatment and surgery. However, TRG systems are 
usually based on the estimation of residual tumor but do not consider stromal or 
metabolic changes after treatment. Spatial metabolomics analysis is a powerful 
tool for molecular tissue phenotyping but has not been used so far in the 
context of neoadjuvant treatment of esophageal cancer. We used imaging mass 
spectrometry to assess the potential of spatial metabolomics on tumor and stroma 
tissue for evaluating therapy response of neoadjuvant-treated EAC patients. With 
an accuracy of 89.7%, the binary classifier trained on spatial tumor metabolite 
data proved to be superior for stratifying patients when compared with 
histopathological response assessment, which had an accuracy of 70.5%. 
Sensitivities and specificities for the poor and favorable survival patient 
groups ranged from 84.9% to 93.3% using the metabolic classifier and from 62.2% 
to 78.1% using TRG. The tumor classifier was the only significant prognostic 
factor (HR 3.38, 95% CI 1.40-8.12, p = 0.007) when adjusted for 
clinicopathological parameters such as TRG (HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.67-1.53, 
p = 0.968) or stromal classifier (HR 1.86, 95% CI 0.81-4.25, p = 0.143). The 
classifier even allowed us to further stratify patients within the TRG1-3 
categories. The underlying mechanisms of response to treatment have been figured 
out through network analysis. In summary, metabolic response evaluation 
outperformed histopathological response evaluation in our study with regard to 
prognostic stratification. This finding indicates that the metabolic 
constitution of the tumor may have a greater impact on patient survival than the 
quantity of residual tumor cells or the stroma. © 2021 The Authors. The Journal

Barrett's esophagus (BE) is the precursor lesion for esophageal adenocarcinoma 
(EAC) development. Unfortunately, BE screening/surveillance has not provided the 
anticipated EAC reduction benefit. Noninvasive techniques are increasingly 
available or undergoing testing to screen for BE among those with/without known 
risk factors, and the use of artificial intelligence platforms to aid endoscopic 
screening and surveillance will likely become routine, minimizing missed cases 
or lesions. Management of high-grade dysplasia and intramucosal EAC is clear 
with endoscopic eradication therapy preferred to surgery. BE with low-grade 
dysplasia can be managed with removal of visible lesions combined with 
endoscopic eradication therapy or endoscopic surveillance at present.

OBJECTIVES: Visualization and photodocumentation during endoscopy procedures are 
suggested to be one indicator for endoscopy performance quality. However, this 
indicator is difficult to measure and audit manually in clinical practice. 
Artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging technology that may solve this 
problem.
METHODS: A deep learning model with an accuracy of 96.64% was developed from 
15,305 images for upper endoscopy anatomy classification in the unit. Endoscopy 
images for asymptomatic patients receiving screening endoscopy were evaluated 
with this model to assess the completeness of photodocumentation rate.
RESULTS: A total of 15,723 images from 472 upper endoscopies performed by 12 
endoscopists were enrolled. The complete photodocumentation rate from the 
pharynx to the duodenum was 53.8% and from the esophagus to the duodenum was 
78.0% in this study. Endoscopists with a higher adenoma detection rate had a 
higher complete examination rate from the pharynx to duodenum (60.0% vs. 38.7%, 
P < 0.0001) and from esophagus to duodenum (83.0% vs. 65.7%, P < 0.0001) 
compared with endoscopists with lower adenoma detection rate. The pharynx, 
gastric angle, gastric retroflex view, gastric antrum, and the first portion of 
duodenum are likely to be missed by endoscopists with lower adenoma detection 
rates.
CONCLUSIONS: We report the use of a deep learning model to audit endoscopy 
photodocumentation quality in our unit. Endoscopists with better performance in 
colonoscopy had a better performance for this quality indicator. The use of such 
an AI system may help the endoscopy unit audit endoscopy performance.

Metallurgy and material design have thousands of years' history and have played 
a critical role in the civilization process of humankind. The traditional 
trial-and-error method has been unprecedentedly challenged in the modern era 
when the number of components and phases in novel alloys keeps increasing, with 
high-entropy alloys as the representative. New opportunities emerge for alloy 
design in the artificial intelligence era. Here, a successful machine-learning 
(ML) method has been developed to identify the microstructure images with 
eye-challenging morphology for a number of martensitic and ferritic steels. 
Assisted by it, a new neural-network method is proposed for the inverse design 
of alloys with 20 components, which can accelerate the design process based on 
microstructure. The method is also readily applied to other material systems 
given sufficient microstructure images. This work lays the foundation for 
inverse alloy design based on microstructure images with extremely similar 
features.

BACKGROUND: Machine learning (ML) is an emerging tool for predicting need of 
end-of-life discussion and palliative care, by using mortality as a proxy. But 
deaths, unforeseen by emergency physicians at time of the emergency department 
(ED) visit, might have a weaker association with the ED visit.
OBJECTIVES: To develop an ML algorithm that predicts unsurprising deaths within 
30 days after ED discharge.
METHODS: In this retrospective registry study, we included all ED attendances 
within the Swedish region of Halland in 2015 and 2016. All registered deaths 
within 30 days after ED discharge were classified as either "surprising" or 
"unsurprising" by an adjudicating committee with three senior specialists in 
emergency medicine. ML algorithms were developed for the death subclasses by 
using Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine 
(SVM).
RESULTS: Of all 30-day deaths (n = 148), 76% (n = 113) were not surprising to 
the adjudicating committee. The most common diseases were advanced stage cancer, 
multidisease/frailty, and dementia. By using LR, RF, and SVM, mean area under 
the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) of unsurprising deaths in 
the test set were 0.950 (SD 0.008), 0.944 (SD 0.007), and 0.949 (SD 0.007), 
respectively. For all mortality, the ROC-AUCs for LR, RF, and SVM were 0.924 (SD 
0.012), 0.922 (SD 0.009), and 0.931 (SD 0.008). The difference in prediction 
performance between all and unsurprising death was statistically significant (P 
< .001) for all three models.
CONCLUSION: In patients discharged to home from the ED, three-quarters of all 
30-day deaths did not surprise an adjudicating committee with emergency medicine 
specialists. When only unsurprising deaths were included, ML mortality 
prediction improved significantly.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to automatically detect, segment and label 
teeth, crowns, fillings, root canal fillings, implants and root remnants on 
panoramic radiographs (PR(s)).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: As a reference, 2000 PR(s) were manually annotated and 
labeled. A deep-learning approach based on mask R-CNN with Resnet-50 in 
combination with a rule-based heuristic algorithm and a combinatorial search 
algorithm was trained and validated on 1800 PR(s). Subsquently, the trained 
algorithm was applied onto a test set consisting of 200 PR(s). F1 scores, as a 
measure of accuracy, were calculated to quantify the degree of similarity 
between the annotated ground-truth and the model predictions. The F1-score 
considers the harmonic mean of precison (positive predictive value) and recall 
(specificity).
RESULTS: The proposes method achieved F1 scores up to 0.993, 0.952 and 0.97 for 
detection, segmentation and labeling, respectivley.
CONCLUSION: The proposed method forms a promising foundation for the further 
development of automatic chart filing on PR(s).
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Deep learning may assist clinicians in summarizing the 
radiological findings on panoramic radiographs. The impact of using such models 
in clinical practice should be explored.

BACKGROUND: To develop and validate a risk prediction nomogram based on a deep 
learning convolutional neural networks (CNN) model and epidemiological 
characteristics for lung cancer screening in patients with small pulmonary 
nodules (SPN).
METHODS: This study included three data sets. First, a CNN model was developed 
and tested on data set 1. Then, a hybrid prediction model was developed on data 
set 2 by multivariable binary logistic regression analysis. We combined the CNN 
model score and the selected epidemiological risk factors, and a risk prediction 
nomogram was presented. An independent multicenter cohort was used for model 
external validation. The performance of the nomogram was assessed with respect 
to its calibration and discrimination.
RESULTS: The final hybrid model included the CNN model score and the screened 
risk factors included age, gender, smoking status and family history of cancer. 
The nomogram showed good discrimination and calibration with an area under the 
curve (AUC) of 91.6% (95% CI: 89.4%-93.5%), compare with the CNN model, the 
improvement was significance. The performance of the nomogram still showed good 
discrimination and good calibration in the multicenter validation cohort, with 
an AUC of 88.3% (95% CI: 83.1%-92.3%).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that epidemiological characteristics should be 
considered in lung cancer screening, which can significantly improve the

Machine learning is a good tool to simulate human cognitive skills as it is 
about mapping perceived information to various labels or action choices, aiming 
at optimal behavior policies for a human or an artificial agent operating in the 
environment. Regarding autonomous systems, objects and situations are perceived 
by some receptors as divided between sensors. Reactions to the input (e.g., 
actions) are distributed among the particular capability providers or actuators. 
Cognitive models can be trained as, for example, neural networks. We suggest 
training such models for cases of potential disabilities. Disability can be 
either the absence of one or more cognitive sensors or actuators at different 
levels of cognitive model. We adapt several neural network architectures to 
simulate various cognitive disabilities. The idea has been triggered by the 
"coolability" (enhanced capability) paradox, according to which a person with 
some disability can be more efficient in using other capabilities. Therefore, an 
autonomous system (human or artificial) pretrained with simulated disabilities 
will be more efficient when acting in adversarial conditions. We consider these 
coolabilities as complementary artificial intelligence and argue on the 
usefulness if this concept for various applications.

OBJECTIVES: Automatic tooth segmentation and classification from cone beam 
computed tomography (CBCT) have become an integral component of the digital 
dental workflows. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop and validate a 
deep learning approach for an automatic tooth segmentation and classification 
from CBCT images.
METHODS: A dataset of 186 CBCT scans was acquired from two CBCT machines with 
different acquisition settings. An artificial intelligence (AI) framework was 
built to segment and classify teeth. Teeth were segmented in a three-step 
approach with each step consisting of a 3D U-Net and step 2 included 
classification. The dataset was divided into training set (140 scans) to train 
the model based on ground-truth segmented teeth, validation set (35 scans) to 
test the model performance and test set (11 scans) to evaluate the model 
performance compared to ground-truth. Different evaluation metrics were used 
such as precision, recall rate and time.
RESULTS: The AI framework correctly segmented teeth with optimal precision 
(0.98±0.02) and recall (0.83±0.05). The difference between the AI model and 
ground-truth was 0.56±0.38 mm based on 95% Hausdorff distance confirming the 
high performance of AI compared to ground-truth. Furthermore, segmentation of 
all the teeth within a scan was more than 1800 times faster for AI compared to 
that of an expert. Teeth classification also performed optimally with a recall 
rate of 98.5% and precision of 97.9%.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed 3D U-Net based AI framework is an accurate and 
time-efficient deep learning system for automatic tooth segmentation and 
classification without expert refinement.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The proposed system might enable potential future 
applications for diagnostics and treatment planning in the field of digital 
dentistry, while reducing clinical workload.

Hierarchical Representation Network With Auxiliary Tasks for Video Captioning 
and Video Question Answering.

Gao L, Lei Y, Zeng P, Song J, Wang M, Shen HT.

Recently, integrating vision and language for in-depth video understanding e.g., 
video captioning and video question answering, has become a promising direction 
for artificial intelligence. However, due to the complexity of video 
information, it is challenging to extract a video feature that can well 
represent multiple levels of concepts i.e., objects, actions and events. 
Meanwhile, content completeness and syntactic consistency play an important role 
in high-quality language-related video understanding. Motivated by these, we 
propose a novel framework, named Hierarchical Representation Network with 
Auxiliary Tasks (HRNAT), for learning multi-level representations and obtaining 
syntax-aware video captions. Specifically, the Cross-modality Matching Task 
enables the learning of hierarchical representation of videos, guided by the 
three-level representation of languages. The Syntax-guiding Task and the 
Vision-assist Task contribute to generating descriptions which are not only 
globally similar to the video content, but also syntax-consistent to the 
ground-truth description. The key components of our model are general and they 
can be readily applied to both video captioning and video question answering 
tasks. Performances for the above tasks on several benchmark datasets validate 
the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method compared with the 
state-of-the-art methods. Codes and models are also released

prospects.

Rapid, inexpensive, and laboratory-free diagnostic of viral pathogens is highly 
critical in controlling viral pandemics. In recent years, nanopore-based sensors 
have been employed to detect, identify, and classify virus particles. By tracing 
ionic current containing target molecules across nano-scale pores, nanopore 
sensors can recognize the target molecules at the single-molecule level. In the 
case of viruses, they enable discrimination of individual viruses and obtaining 
important information on the physical and chemical properties of viral 
particles. Despite classical benchtop virus detection methods, such as 
amplification techniques (e.g., PCR) or immunological assays (e.g., ELISA), that 
are mainly laboratory-based, expensive and time-consuming, nanopore-based 
sensing methods can enable low-cost and real-time point-of-care (PoC) and 
point-of-need (PoN) monitoring of target viruses. This review discusses the 
limitations of classical virus detection methods in PoN virus monitoring and 
then provides a comprehensive overview of nanopore sensing technology and its 
emerging applications in quantifying virus particles and classifying virus 
sub-types. Afterward, it discusses the recent progress in the field of nanopore 
sensing, including integrating nanopore sensors with microfabrication 
technology, microfluidics and artificial intelligence, which have been 
demonstrated to be promising in developing the next generation of low-cost and 
portable biosensors for the sensitive recognition of viruses and emerging 
pathogens.

BACKGROUND: Early detection of depression is very important for the treatment of 
patients. In view of the current inefficient screening methods for depression, 
the research of depression identification technology is a complex problem with 
application value.
METHODS: Our research propose a new experimental method for depression detection 
based on audio and text. 160 Chinese subjects are investigated in this study. It 
is worth noting that we propose a text reading experiment to make subjects 
emotions change rapidly. It will be called Segmental Emotional Speech Experiment 
(SESE) below. We extract 384-dimensional Low-level audio features to find the 
differences of different emotional change in SESE. At the same time, our 
research propose a multi-modal fusion method based on DeepSpectrum features and 
word vector features to detect depression by using deep learning.
RESULTS: Our experiment proved that SESE can improve the recognition accuracy of 
depression and found differences in Low-level audio features. Case group and 
Control group, gender and age are grouped for verification. It is also 
satisfactory that the multi-modal fusion model achieves accuracy of 0.912 and F1 
score of 0.906.
CONCLUSIONS: Our contribution is twofold. First, we propose and verify SESE, 
which can provide a new experimental idea for the follow-up researchers. 
Secondly, a new efficient multi-modal depression recognition model is proposed.

OBJECTIVE: We investigated the diagnostic progression to bipolar disorder (BD) 
among adolescents and young adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder 
(ADHD).
METHODS: Using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, we 
enrolled adolescents and young adults aged 10-29 years with ADHD between January 
1, 2001, and December 31, 2010, who were followed up until December 31, 2011, to 
determine progression to BD. Cox regression analysis was used to examine 
candidate risk and protective factors.
RESULTS: At the 11-year follow-up, the progression rate from ADHD to BD was 
5.12%. Of the participants who progressed, 62.16% (322/518) progressed within 
the first 3 years. Risk factors for progression were as follows: older age 
(hazard ratio [HR], 1.058; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.033-1.084), 
comorbidity with autistic spectrum disorder (HR, 1.839; 95% CI, 1.415-2.391), 
disruptive behavior disorder (HR, 1.434; 95% CI, 1.132-1.816), intelligence 
disability (HR, 1.744; 95% CI, 1.399-2.176), depressive disorder (HR, 1.978; 95% 
CI, 1.577-2.482), alcohol use disorder (HR, 1.705; 95% CI, 1.057-2.751), cluster 
A (HR, 2.508; 95% CI, 1.167-5.391) or B (HR, 2.718; 95% CI, 1.974-3.741) 
personality disorder, and a family history of BD (HR, 2.618; 95% CI, 
1.823-3.758) Identified protective factors were male sex (HR, 0.771; 95% CI, 
0.630-0.943) and cluster C personality disorder (HR, 0.278; 95% CI, 
0.086-0.898).
CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated the specific risk and protective factors for 
BD progression among adolescents and young adults with ADHD. It is important for 
clinician and mental health care providers to recognize identified factors to 
focus on early detection and prompt intervention.

BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia is defined as muscle wasting, characterized by a 
progressive loss of muscle mass and function due to ageing. Diagnosis of 
sarcopenia typically involves both muscle imaging and the physical performance 
of people exhibiting signs of muscle weakness. Despite its worldwide prevalence, 
a molecular method for accurately diagnosing sarcopenia has not been 
established.
METHODS: We develop an artificial intelligence (AI) diagnosis model of 
sarcopenia using a published transcriptome dataset comprising patients from 
multiple ethnicities. For the AI model for sarcopenia diagnosis, we use a 
transcriptome database comprising 17 339 genes from 118 subjects. Among the 
17 339 genes, we select 27 features as the model inputs. For feature selection, 
we use a random forest, extreme gradient boosting and adaptive boosting. Using 
the top 27 features, we propose a four-layer deep neural network, named 
DSnet-v1, for sarcopenia diagnosis.
RESULTS: Among isolated testing datasets, DSnet-v1 provides high sensitivity 
(100%), specificity (94.12%), accuracy (95.83%), balanced accuracy (97.06%) and 
area under receiver operating characteristics (0.99). To extend the number of 
patient data, we develop a web application (http://sarcopeniaAI.ml/), where the 
model can be accessed unrestrictedly to diagnose sarcopenia if the transcriptome 
is available. A focused analysis of the top 27 genes for their differential or 
co-expression with other genes implied the potential existence of race-specific 
factors for sarcopenia, suggesting the possibility of identifying causal factors 
of sarcopenia when a more extended dataset is provided.
CONCLUSIONS: Our new AI model, DSnet-v1, accurately diagnoses sarcopenia and is 
currently available publicly to assist healthcare providers in diagnosing and 
treating sarcopenia.

Recent studies have suggested that cardiac abnormalities can be detected from 
the electrocardiogram (ECG) using deep machine learning (DL) models. However, 
most DL algorithms lack interpretability, since they do not provide any 
justification for their decisions. In this study, we designed two new frameworks 
to interpret the classification results of DL algorithms trained for 12-lead ECG 
classification. The frameworks allow us to highlight not only the ECG samples 
that contributed most to the classification, but also which between the P-wave, 
QRS complex and T-wave, hereafter simply called 'waves', were the most relevant 
for the diagnosis. The frameworks were designed to be compatible with any DL 
model, including the ones already trained. The frameworks were tested on a 
selected Deep Neural Network, trained on a publicly available dataset, to 
automatically classify 24 cardiac abnormalities from 12-lead ECG signals. 
Experimental results showed that the frameworks were able to detect the most 
relevant ECG waves contributing to the classification. Often the network relied 
on portions of the ECG which are also considered by cardiologists to detect the 
same cardiac abnormalities, but this was not always the case. In conclusion, the 
proposed frameworks may unveil whether the network relies on features which are 
clinically significant for the detection of cardiac abnormalities from 12-lead 
ECG signals, thus increasing the trust in the DL models. This article is part of

Recent developments in computational physiology have successfully exploited 
advanced signal processing and artificial intelligence tools for predicting or 
uncovering characteristic features of physiological and pathological states in 
humans. While these advanced tools have demonstrated excellent diagnostic 
capabilities, the high complexity of these computational 'black boxes' may 
severely limit scientific inference, especially in terms of biological insight 
about both physiology and pathological aberrations. This theme issue highlights 
current challenges and opportunities of advanced computational tools for 
processing dynamical data reflecting autonomic nervous system dynamics, with a 
specific focus on cardiovascular control physiology and pathology. This includes 
the development and adaptation of complex signal processing methods, 
multivariate cardiovascular models, multiscale and nonlinear models for 
central-peripheral dynamics, as well as deep and transfer learning algorithms 
applied to large datasets. The width of this perspective highlights the issues 
of specificity in heartbeat-related features and supports the need for an 
imminent transition from the black-box paradigm to explainable and personalized 
clinical models in cardiovascular research. This article is part of the theme 
issue 'Advanced computation in cardiovascular physiology: new challenges and 
opportunities'.

A massive amount of multimodal data are continuously collected in the intensive 
care unit (ICU) along each patient stay, offering a great opportunity for the 
development of smart monitoring devices based on artificial intelligence (AI). 
The two main sources of relevant information collected in the ICU are the 
electronic health records (EHRs) and vital sign waveforms continuously recorded 
at the bedside. While EHRs are already widely processed by AI algorithms for 
prompt diagnosis and prognosis, AI-based assessments of the patients' 
pathophysiological state using waveforms are less developed, and their use is 
still limited to real-time monitoring for basic visual vital sign feedback at 
the bedside. This study uses data from the MIMIC-III database (PhysioNet) to 
propose a novel AI approach in ICU patient monitoring that incorporates features 
estimated by a closed-loop cardiovascular model, with the specific goal of 
identifying sepsis within the first hour of admission. Our top benchmark results 
(AUROC = 0.92, AUPRC = 0.90) suggest that features derived by cardiovascular 
control models may play a key role in identifying sepsis, by continuous 
monitoring performed through advanced multivariate modelling of vital sign 
waveforms. This work lays foundations for a deeper data integration paradigm 
which will help clinicians in their decision-making processes. This article is

Machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms hold significant 
promise for addressing important clinical needs when applied to medical imaging; 
however, integration of algorithms into a radiology department is challenging. 
Vended algorithms are integrated into the workflow, successfully, but are 
typically closed systems and unavailable for site researchers to deploy 
algorithms. Rather than AI researchers creating one-off solutions, a general, 
multi-purpose integration system is desired. Here, we present a set of use cases 
and requirements for a system designed to enable rapid deployment of AI 
algorithms into the radiologist's workflow. The system uses standards-compliant 
digital imaging and communications in medicine structured reporting (DICOM SR) 
to present AI measurements, results, and findings to the radiologist in a 
clinical context and enables acceptance or rejection of results. The system also 
implements a feedback mechanism for post-processing technologists to correct 
results as directed by the radiologist. We demonstrate integration of a body 
composition algorithm and an algorithm for determining total kidney volume for 
patients with polycystic kidney disease.

BACKGROUND: Letters of recommendation (LoRs) play an important role in resident 
selection. Author language varies implicitly toward male and female applicants. 
We examined gender bias in LoRs written for surgical residency candidates across 
three decades at one institution.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis of LoRs written for general surgery residency 
candidates between 1980 and 2011 using artificial intelligence (AI) to conduct 
natural language processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis, and computer-based 
algorithms to detect gender bias. Applicants were grouped by scaled clerkship 
grades and USMLE scores. Data were analyzed among groups with t-tests, ANOVA, 
and non-parametric tests, as appropriate.
RESULTS: A total of 611 LoRs were analyzed for 171 applicants (16.4% female), 
and 95.3% of letter authors were male. Scaled USMLE scores and clerkship grades 
(SCG) were similar for both genders (p > 0.05 for both). Average word count for 
all letters was 290 words and was not significantly different between genders 
(p = 0.18). LoRs written before 2000 were significantly shorter than those 
written after, among applicants of both genders (female p = 0.004; male 
p < 0.001). Gender bias analysis of female LoRs revealed more gendered wording 
compared to male LoRs (p = 0.04) and was most prominent among females with lower 
SCG (9.5 vs 5.1, p = 0.01). Sentiment analysis revealed male LoRs with female 
authors had significantly more positive sentiment compared to female LoRs 
(p = 0.02), and males with higher SCG had more positive sentiment compared to 
those with lower SCG (9.4 vs 8.2, p = 0.03). NLP detected more "fear" in male 
LoRs with lower SCGs (0.11 vs 0.09, p = 0.02). Female LoRs with higher SCGs had 
more positive sentiment (0.78 vs 0.83, p = 0.03) and "joy" (0.60 vs 0.63, 
p = 0.02), although those written before 2000 had less "joy" (0.5 vs 0.63, 
p = 0.006).
CONCLUSION: AI and computer-based algorithms detected linguistic differences and 
gender bias in LoRs written for general surgery residency applicants, even 
following stratification by clerkship grades and when analyzed by decade.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We explored the feasibility of automated, arterial input 
function independent, vendor neutral prediction of core infarct, and penumbral 
tissue using complete and partial computed tomographic perfusion data sets 
through neural networks.
METHODS: Using retrospective computed tomographic perfusion data from 57 
patients, split as training/validation (60%/40%), we developed and validated 
separate 2-dimensional U-net models for cerebral blood flow (CBF) and time to 
maximum (Tmax) maps calculation to predict core infarct and tissue at risk, 
respectively. Once trained, the full sets of 28 input images were sequentially 
reduced to equitemporal 14, 10, and 7 time points. The averaged structural 
similarity index measure between the model-derived images and ground truth 
perfusion maps was compared. Volumes for core infarct and Tmax were compared 
using the Pearson correlation coefficient.
RESULTS: Both CBF and Tmax maps derived using 28 and 14 time points had similar 
structural similarity index measure (0.80-0.81; P>0.05) when compared with 
ground truth images. The Pearson correlation for the CBF and Tmax volumes 
derived from the model using 28-tp with ground truth volumes derived from the 
RAPID software was 0.69 for CBF and 0.74 for Tmax. The predicted maps were fully 
concordant in terms of laterality to the commercial perfusion maps. The mean 
Dice scores were 0.54 for the core infarct and 0.63 for the hypoperfusion maps.
CONCLUSIONS: Artificial intelligence model-derived volumes show good correlation 
with RAPID-derived volumes for CBF and Tmax. Within the constraints of a small 
sample size, the perfusion map quality is similar when using 14-tp instead of 
28-tp. Our findings provide proof of concept that vendor neutral artificial 
intelligence models for computed tomographic perfusion processing using complete 
or partial image data sets appear feasible. The model accuracy could be further 
optimized using larger data sets.

Cochlear Implant Recipients.

Louis, MO.

Richardson.

PURPOSE: The aims of this study were, for pediatric cochlear implant (CI) 
recipients, (a) to determine the effect of age on their spectral modulation 
detection (SMD) ability and compare their age effect to that of their typically 
hearing (TH) peers; (b) to identify demographic, cognitive, and audiological 
factors associated with SMD ability; and (c) to determine the unique 
contribution of SMD ability to segmental and suprasegmental speech perception 
performance.
METHOD: A total of 104 pediatric CI recipients and 38 TH peers (ages 6-11 years) 
completed a test of SMD. CI recipients completed tests of segmental (e.g., word 
recognition in noise and vowels and consonants in quiet) and suprasegmental 
(e.g., talker discrimination, stress discrimination, and emotion identification) 
perception, nonverbal intelligence, and working memory. Regressions analyses 
were used to examine the effects of group and age on percent-correct SMD scores. 
For the CI group, the effects of demographic, audiological, and cognitive 
variables on SMD performance and the effects of SMD on speech perception were 
examined.
RESULTS: The TH group performed significantly better than the CI group on SMD. 
Both groups showed better performance with increasing age. Significant 
predictors of SMD performance for the CI group were age and nonverbal 
intelligence. SMD performance predicted significant variance in segmental and 
suprasegmental perception. The variance predicted by SMD performance was nearly 
double for suprasegmental than for segmental perception.
CONCLUSIONS: Children in the CI group, on average, scored lower than their TH 
peers. The slopes of improvement in SMD with age did not differ between the 
groups. The significant effect of nonverbal intelligence on SMD performance in 
CI recipients indicates that difficulties inherent in the task affect outcomes. 
SMD ability predicted speech perception scores, with a more prominent role in 
suprasegmental than in segmental speech perception. SMD ability may provide a 
useful nonlinguistic tool for predicting speech perception benefit, with 
cautious interpretation based on age and cognitive function.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the relation between the 
acceptable noise level (ANL) and cognitive measures of auditory attention and 
working memory.
DESIGN: Young adults were administered the following tests: the ANL, the Digit 
Span and Letter-Number Sequencing subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence 
Scale-Fourth Edition, the Auditory Attention subtest from the Woodcock-Johnson 
Tests of Cognitive Abilities, the Hearing in Noise Test (HINT), and the 
operation span (OSPAN) test. A correlation matrix was constructed using Pearson 
coefficients.
STUDY SAMPLE: Twenty-four young adults aged 20-29 years with normal hearing 
participated in the study.
RESULTS: No significant relationships were found among the ANL and the different 
cognitive tasks, nor was there a significant relation found between the ANL and 
the HINT. However, significant relationships were found between individual 
cognitive tasks. There was a significant relation found between selective 
attention and the most comfortable level of presentation of a story.
CONCLUSION: Selective attention may be a key cognitive function in acceptance of 
background noise.

BACKGROUND: Patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can be 
treated with a range of targeted therapies following inadequate response to 
conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs such as 
methotrexate. Whereas clinical practice guidelines provide no formal 
recommendations for initial targeted therapies, the tumor necrosis factor alpha 
inhibitor (TNFi) class is the prevalent first-line selection based on clinician 
experience, its safety profile, and/or formulary requirements, while also being 
the costliest. Most patients do not achieve adequate clinical response with a 
first-line TNFi, however. A molecular signature response classifier (MSRC) test 
that assesses RA-related biomarkers can identify patients who are unlikely to 
achieve adequate response to TNFi-class therapies. OBJECTIVE: To model 
cost-effectiveness of MSRC-guided, first-line targeted therapy selection 
compared with current standard care. METHODS: This budget impact analysis used 
data sourced from August to September 2020. The prevalence of each first-line 
targeted therapy was obtained using market intelligence from Datamonitor/Informa 
PLC Rheumatology Dashboard Forecast 2020, and the average first-year cost of 
treatment for each class was calculated using wholesale acquisition costs from 
IBM Micromedex RED BOOK Online. Average effectiveness for each class was based 
on manufacturer-reported ACR50 response rates (American College of Rheumatology 
adequate response criteria of 50% improvement at 6 months after therapy 
initiation). The impact of MSRC testing on first therapy selection was predicted 
based on a third party-generated decision-impact study that analyzed potential 
alterations in rheumatologist prescribing patterns after receiving MSRC test 
reports. Sensitivity analysis evaluated potential impacts of variation in 
first-year medication cost, adherence to MSRC report, and test price on the 
first-year cost of treatment. Cost for response (first-year therapy cost therapy 
divided by probability of achieving ACR50) was compared between standard care 
and MSRC-guided care. RESULTS: The estimated cost for first-year, standard-care 
treatment was $65,117, with 80% of patients initiating treatment with a TNFi. 
Cost for achieving ACR50 response was $177,046. After applying MSRC-guided 
patient stratification and therapy selection, the first-year cost was $56,543, 
net of test price, with 49.0% of patients initiating with a TNFi. First-year 
MSRC-guided care cost, including test price, was estimated at $117,103, a 33.9% 
improvement over standard care. Sensitivity analysis showed a net cost 
improvement for guided care vs standard care across all scenarios. Patients 
predicted to be inadequate TNFi responders, when modeled with lower-priced 
alternatives, were predicted to show increased ACR50 response rates. Those with 
MSRC test results indicating a first-line TNFi were predicted to show an ACR50 
response rate superior to that for any other class. In this model, if 
implemented clinically, MSRC-guided care might save the US health care system 
more than $850 million annually and improve ACR50 by up to 31.3%. CONCLUSIONS: 
Precision medicine using MSRC-guided patient stratification and therapy 
selection may both decrease cost and improve efficacy of targeted RA therapies.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the accuracy and clinical efficacy of a hybrid 
Greulich-Pyle (GP) and modified Tanner-Whitehouse (TW) artificial intelligence 
(AI) model for bone age assessment.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A deep learning-based model was trained on an open 
dataset of multiple ethnicities. A total of 102 hand radiographs (51 male and 51 
female; mean age ± standard deviation = 10.95 ± 2.37 years) from a single 
institution were selected for external validation. Three human experts performed 
bone age assessments based on the GP atlas to develop a reference standard. Two 
study radiologists performed bone age assessments with and without AI model 
assistance in two separate sessions, for which the reading time was recorded. 
The performance of the AI software was assessed by comparing the mean absolute 
difference between the AI-calculated bone age and the reference standard. The 
reading time was compared between reading with and without AI using a paired t 
test. Furthermore, the reliability between the two study radiologists' bone age 
assessments was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), and 
the results were compared between reading with and without AI.
RESULTS: The bone ages assessed by the experts and the AI model were not 
significantly different (11.39 ± 2.74 years and 11.35 ± 2.76 years, 
respectively, p = 0.31). The mean absolute difference was 0.39 years (95% 
confidence interval, 0.33-0.45 years) between the automated AI assessment and 
the reference standard. The mean reading time of the two study radiologists was 
reduced from 54.29 to 35.37 seconds with AI model assistance (p < 0.001). The 
ICC of the two study radiologists slightly increased with AI model assistance 
(from 0.945 to 0.990).
CONCLUSION: The proposed AI model was accurate for assessing bone age. 
Furthermore, this model appeared to enhance the clinical efficacy by reducing 
the reading time and improving the inter-observer reliability.

COVID-19 diagnosis from chest x-rays: developing a simple, fast, and accurate 
neural network.

Den Haag, The Netherlands.

PURPOSE: Chest x-rays are a fast and inexpensive test that may potentially 
diagnose COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. However, chest 
imaging is not a first-line test for COVID-19 due to low diagnostic accuracy and 
confounding with other viral pneumonias. Recent research using deep learning may 
help overcome this issue as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have 
demonstrated high accuracy of COVID-19 diagnosis at an early stage.
METHODS: We used the COVID-19 Radiography database [36], which contains x-ray 
images of COVID-19, other viral pneumonia, and normal lungs. We developed a CNN 
in which we added a dense layer on top of a pre-trained baseline CNN 
(EfficientNetB0), and we trained, validated, and tested the model on 15,153 
X-ray images. We used data augmentation to avoid overfitting and address class 
imbalance; we used fine-tuning to improve the model's performance. From the 
external test dataset, we calculated the model's accuracy, sensitivity, 
specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and F1-score.
RESULTS: Our model differentiated COVID-19 from normal lungs with 95% accuracy, 
90% sensitivity, and 97% specificity; it differentiated COVID-19 from other 
viral pneumonia and normal lungs with 93% accuracy, 94% sensitivity, and 95% 
specificity.
CONCLUSIONS: Our parsimonious CNN shows that it is possible to differentiate 
COVID-19 from other viral pneumonia and normal lungs on x-ray images with high 
accuracy. Our method may assist clinicians with making more accurate diagnostic 
decisions and support chest X-rays as a valuable screening tool for the early, 
rapid diagnosis of COVID-19.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has been developed through repeated new discoveries 
since around 1960. The use of AI is now becoming widespread within society and 
our daily lives. AI is also being introduced into healthcare, such as medicine 
and drug development; however, it is currently biased towards specific domains. 
The present review traces the history of the development of various AI-based 
applications in healthcare and compares AI-based healthcare with conventional 
healthcare to show the future prospects for this type of care. Knowledge of the 
past and present development of AI-based applications would be useful for the 
future utilization of novel AI approaches in healthcare.

In 1955, when John McCarthy and his colleagues proposed their first study of 
artificial intelligence, they suggested that 'every aspect of learning or any 
other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a 
machine can be made to simulate it'. Whether that might ever be possible would 
depend on how we define intelligence, but what is indisputable is that new 
methods are needed to analyse and interpret the copious information provided by 
digital medical images, genomic databases, and biobanks. Technological advances 
have enabled applications of artificial intelligence (AI) including machine 
learning (ML) to be implemented into clinical practice, and their related 
scientific literature is exploding. Advocates argue enthusiastically that AI 
will transform many aspects of clinical cardiovascular medicine, while sceptics 
stress the importance of caution and the need for more evidence. This report 
summarizes the main opposing arguments that were presented in a debate at the 
2021 Congress of the European Society of Cardiology. Artificial intelligence is 
an advanced analytical technique that should be considered when conventional 
statistical methods are insufficient, but testing a hypothesis or solving a 
clinical problem-not finding another application for AI-remains the most 
important objective. Artificial intelligence and ML methods should be 
transparent and interpretable, if they are to be approved by regulators and 
trusted to provide support for clinical decisions. Physicians need to understand 
AI methods and collaborate with engineers. Few applications have yet been shown 
to have a positive impact on clinical outcomes, so investment in research is 
essential.

radiographs.
METHODS: A cluster-randomized cross-over controlled trial was conducted. A 
commercially available software employing a fully convolutional neural network 
for caries detection (dentalXrai Pro, dentalXrai Ltd.) was randomly employed by 
22 dentists, supporting their caries detection on 20 bitewings randomly chosen 
from a pool of 140 bitewings, with 10 bitewings randomly being supported by AI 
and 10 not. The reference test had been established by 4 + 1 independent experts 
in a pixelwise fashion. Caries was subgrouped as enamel, early dentin and 
advanced dentin caries, and accuracy and treatment decisions for each caries 
lesion assessed.
RESULTS: Dentists with AI showed a significantly higher mean (95% CI) area under 
the Receiver-Operating-Characteristics curve (0.89; 0.87-0.90) than those 
without AI (0.85; 0.83-0.86; p<0.05), mainly as their sensitivity was 
significantly higher (0.81; 0.74-0.87 compared with 0.72; 0.64-0.79; p<0.05) 
while the specificity was not significantly affected (p>0.05). This increase in 
sensitivity was found for enamel, but not early or advanced dentin lesions. 
Higher sensitivity came with an increase in non-invasive, but also invasive 
treatment decisions (p<0.05).
CONCLUSION: AI can increase dentists' diagnostic accuracy but may also increase 
invasive treatment decisions.
CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: AI can increase dentists' diagnostic accuracy, mainly via 
increasing their sensitivity for detecting enamel lesions, but may also increase 
invasive therapy decisions. Differences in the effects of AI for different 
dentists should be explored, and dentists should be guided as to which therapy 
to choose when detecting caries lesions using AI support.

The mental rotation task is a particular spatial skill that helps people process 
visual information and is associated with intelligence and academic performance. 
Previous studies have found consistent sex difference in mental rotation. 
However, the neural mechanism of the sex-related difference in mental rotation 
remains unclear. This study investigates the association between sex, mental 
rotation and the functional connectivity (FC) of resting-state networks (RSNs) 
to explore neural correlates of different mental rotation abilities between 
males and females. Compared with females, males performed better on the mental 
rotation test. The mental rotation scores were significantly correlated with the 
special FC between the default mode network (DMN) and salience network (SN). The 
results of the mediation analysis revealed that the special FC between the DMN 
and SN mediated the association between sex and mental rotation. Based on these 
findings, males had higher FC between the DMN and SN, which subsequently 
promoted their mental rotation performance. These results emphasized the 
importance of sex in spatial cognition studies of both healthy people and 
individuals with neuropsychiatric disorders and deepened our understanding of 
the neural mechanisms underlying sex difference in mental rotation.

INTRODUCTION: Diagnosis of dermatological disorders is primarily based on 
clinical examination in combination with histopathology. However, clinical 
findings alone may not be sufficient for accurate diagnosis and cutaneous 
biopsies are being associated with morbidity.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this article is to review the newer technologies 
along with their applications, limitation and future prospectus.
METHODOLOGY: Comprehensive literature search was performed using electronic 
online databases "PubMed" and "Google Scholar". Articles published in English 
language were considered for the review.
RESULTS: In order to improve and/or widen the armamentarium in dermatologic 
disease diagnosis and therapy, newer emerging technologies are being made 
available which aid in diagnosis and management. New emerging technologies 
include confocal microscopy, digital photographic imaging, optical coherence 
tomography, high frequency ultrasonography, and artificial intelligence. There 
have been advancements in the dermoscopes.
CONCLUSION: Significant progress is seen in the diagnostic methods and imaging 
technologies in dermatology, each having its advantages and limitations. 
Artificial intelligence/machine-based learning software may have a great scope 
to influence the dermatological practice.

Neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) share a long history of 
collaboration. Advances in neuroscience, alongside huge leaps in computer 
processing power over the last few decades, have given rise to a new generation 
of in silico neural networks inspired by the architecture of the brain. These AI 
systems are now capable of many of the advanced perceptual and cognitive 
abilities of biological systems, including object recognition and decision 
making. Moreover, AI is now increasingly being employed as a tool for 
neuroscience research and is transforming our understanding of brain functions. 
In particular, deep learning has been used to model how convolutional layers and 
recurrent connections in the brain's cerebral cortex control important 
functions, including visual processing, memory, and motor control. Excitingly, 
the use of neuroscience-inspired AI also holds great promise for understanding 
how changes in brain networks result in psychopathologies, and could even be 
utilized in treatment regimes. Here we discuss recent advancements in four areas 
in which the relationship between neuroscience and AI has led to major 
advancements in the field; (1) AI models of working memory, (2) AI visual 
processing, (3) AI analysis of big neuroscience datasets, and (4) computational 
psychiatry.

Observing chromosomes is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process, and 
chromosomes have been analyzed manually for many years. In the last decade, 
automated acquisition systems for microscopic images have advanced dramatically 
due to advances in their controlling computer systems, and nowadays, it is 
possible to automatically acquire sets of tiling-images consisting of large 
number, more than 1000, of images from large areas of specimens. However, there 
has been no simple and inexpensive system to efficiently select images 
containing mitotic cells among these images. In this paper, a classification 
system of chromosomal images by deep learning artificial intelligence (AI) that 
can be easily handled by non-data scientists was applied. With this system, 
models suitable for our own samples could be easily built on a Macintosh 
computer with Create ML. As examples, models constructed by learning using 
chromosome images derived from various plant species were able to classify 
images containing mitotic cells among samples from plant species not used for 
learning in addition to samples from the species used. The system also worked 
for cells in tissue sections and tetrads. Since this system is inexpensive and 
can be easily trained via deep learning using scientists' own samples, it can be 
used not only for chromosomal image analysis but also for analysis of other 
biology-related images.

Arginase 1 (ARG1) deficiency is a rare urea cycle disorder (UCD), with an 
estimated frequency of 1 per 2,200,000 births in Japan. Patients with ARG1 
deficiency develop symptoms in late infancy or pre-school age with progressive 
neurological manifestations and sometimes present with severe hepatic disease. 
We previously investigated the status of UCDs in Japan; however, only one 
patient was identified as having ARG1 deficiency. Therefore, we aimed to 
investigate the current status of patients with ARG1 deficiency in 2018-2021 
because almost 10 years have passed since the previous study. We present the 
disease history, clinical outcome, and treatment of five surviving patients with 
ARG1 deficiency and discuss the features of ARG1 deficiency in Japan. We found 
that clinicians often face difficulty in diagnosing ARG1 deficiency at the early 
stage of onset because of interpatient variability in onset time and clinical 
manifestations. Blood L-arginine and guanidino compounds were considered to be 
the major factors causing adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. Therefore, early 
detection and intervention of ARG1 deficiency is essential for improved 
neurodevelopmental outcomes. Liver transplantation has been considered an 
effective treatment option that can dramatically improve the quality of life of 
patients, prior to the neurological manifestation of symptoms caused by ARG1 
deficiency.

AIMS: The current gold standard comprehensive assessment of coronary 
microvascular dysfunction (CMD) is through a limited-access invasive 
catheterization lab procedure. We aimed to develop a point-of-care tool to 
assist clinical guidance in patients presenting with chest pain and/or an 
abnormal cardiac functional stress test and with non-obstructive coronary artery 
disease (NOCAD).
METHODS AND RESULTS: This study included 1893 NOCAD patients (<50% angiographic 
stenosis) who underwent CMD evaluation as well as an electrocardiogram (ECG) up 
to 1-year prior. Endothelial-independent CMD was defined by coronary flow 
reserve (CFR) ≤2.5 in response to intracoronary adenosine. Endothelial-dependent 
CMD was defined by a maximal percent increase in coronary blood flow (%ΔCBF) 
≤50% in response to intracoronary acetylcholine infusion. We trained algorithms 
to distinguish between the following outcomes: CFR ≤2.5, %ΔCBF ≤50, and the 
combination of both. Two classes of algorithms were trained, one depending on 
ECG waveforms as input, and another using tabular clinical data. Mean age was 
51 ± 12 years and 66% were females (n = 1257). Area under the curve values 
ranged from 0.49 to 0.67 for all the outcomes. The best performance in our 
analysis was for the outcome CFR ≤2.5 with clinical variables. Area under the 
curve and accuracy were 0.67% and 60%. When decreasing the threshold of 
positivity, sensitivity and negative predictive value increased to 92% and 90%, 
respectively, while specificity and positive predictive value decreased to 25% 
and 29%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: An artificial intelligence-enabled algorithm may be able to assist 
clinical guidance by ruling out CMD in patients presenting with chest pain 
and/or an abnormal functional stress test. This algorithm needs to be 
prospectively validated in different cohorts.

Forms of explanation and understanding for neuroscience and artificial 
intelligence.

University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.

Much of the controversy evoked by the use of deep neural networks as models of 
biological neural systems amount to debates over what constitutes scientific 
progress in neuroscience. To discuss what constitutes scientific progress, one 
must have a goal in mind (progress toward what?). One such long-term goal is to 
produce scientific explanations of intelligent capacities (e.g., object 
recognition, relational reasoning). I argue that the most pressing philosophical 
questions at the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence are 
ultimately concerned with defining the phenomena to be explained and with what 
constitute valid explanations of such phenomena. I propose that a foundation in 
the philosophy of scientific explanation and understanding can scaffold future 
discussions about how an integrated science of intelligence might progress. 
Toward this vision, I review relevant theories of scientific explanation and 
discuss strategies for unifying the scientific goals of neuroscience and AI.

The public specialty ophthalmic clinics in Hong Kong, under the Hospital 
Authority, receive tens of thousands of referrals each year. Triaging these 
referrals incurs a significant workload for practitioners and the other clinical 
duties. It is well-established that Hong Kong is currently facing a shortage of 
healthcare workers. Thus a more efficient system in triaging will not only free 
up resources for better use but also improve the satisfaction of both 
practitioners and patients. Machine learning (ML) has been shown to improve the 
efficiency of various medical workflows, including triaging, by both reducing 
the workload and increasing accuracy in some cases. Despite a myriad of studies 
on medical artificial intelligence, there is no specific framework for a 
triaging algorithm in ophthalmology clinics. This study proposes a general 
framework for developing, deploying and evaluating an ML-based triaging 
algorithm in a clinical setting. Through literature review, this study 
identifies good practices in various facets of developing such a network and 
protocols for maintenance and evaluation of the impact concerning clinical 
utility and external validity out of the laboratory. We hope this framework, 
albeit not exhaustive, can act as a foundation to accelerate future pilot 
studies and deployments.

Understanding information processing in the brain-and creating general-purpose 
artificial intelligence-are long-standing aspirations of scientists and 
engineers worldwide. The distinctive features of human intelligence are 
high-level cognition and control in various interactions with the world 
including the self, which are not defined in advance and are vary over time. The 
challenge of building human-like intelligent machines, as well as progress in 
brain science and behavioural analyses, robotics, and their associated 
theoretical formalisations, speaks to the importance of the world-model learning 
and inference. In this article, after briefly surveying the history and 
challenges of internal model learning and probabilistic learning, we introduce 
the free energy principle, which provides a useful framework within which to 
consider neuronal computation and probabilistic world models. Next, we showcase 
examples of human behaviour and cognition explained under that principle. We 
then describe symbol emergence in the context of probabilistic modelling, as a 
topic at the frontiers of cognitive robotics. Lastly, we review recent progress 
in creating human-like intelligence by using novel probabilistic programming 
languages. The striking consensus that emerges from these studies is that 
probabilistic descriptions of learning and inference are powerful and effective 
ways to create human-like artificial intelligent machines and to understand 
intelligence in the context of how humans interact with their world.

The combined effects of fossil fuel combustion, mass agricultural production and 
deforestation, industrialisation and the evolution of modern transport systems 
have resulted in high levels of carbon emissions and accumulation of greenhouse 
gases, causing profound climate change and ozone layer depletion. The 
consequential depletion of Earth's natural ecosystems and biodiversity is not 
only a devastating loss but a threat to human health. Sustainability-the ability 
to continue activities indefinitely-underpins the principal solutions to these 
problems. Globally, the healthcare sector is a major contributor to carbon 
emissions, with waste production and transport systems being amongst the highest 
contributing factors. The aim of this review is to explore modalities by which 
the healthcare sector, particularly ophthalmology, can reduce carbon emissions, 
related costs and overall environmental impact, whilst maintaining a high 
standard of patient care.

The alarming pandemic situation of Coronavirus infectious disease COVID-19, 
caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has 
become a critical threat to public health. The unexpected outbreak and 
unrealistic progression of COVID-19 have generated an utmost need to realize 
promising therapeutic strategies to fight the pandemic. Drug repurposing-an 
efficient drug discovery technique from approved drugs is an emerging tactic to 
face the immediate global challenge. It​ offers a time-efficient and 
cost-effective way to find potential therapeutic agents for the disease. 
Artificial Intelligence-empowered deep learning models enable the rapid 
identification of potentially repurposable drug candidates against diseases. 
This study presents a deep learning ensemble model to prioritize clinically 
validated anti-viral drugs for their potential efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. The 
method integrates the similarities of drug chemical structures and virus genome 
sequences to generate feature vectors. The best combination of features is 
retrieved by the convolutional neural network in a deep learning manner. The 
extracted deep features are classified by the extreme gradient boosting 
classifier to infer potential virus-drug associations. The method could achieve 
an AUC of 0.8897 with 0.8571 prediction accuracy and 0.8394 sensitivity under 
the fivefold cross-validation. The experimental results and case studies 
demonstrate the suggested deep learning ensemble system yields competitive 
results compared with the state-of-the-art approaches. The top-ranked drugs are 
released for further wet-lab researches.

The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic is unarguably the biggest catastrophe of 
the 21st century, probably the most significant global crisis after the second 
world war. The rapid spreading capability of the virus has compelled the world 
population to maintain strict preventive measures. The outrage of the virus has 
rampaged through the healthcare sector tremendously. This pandemic created a 
huge demand for necessary healthcare equipment, medicines along with the 
requirement for advanced robotics and artificial intelligence-based 
applications. The intelligent robot systems have great potential to render 
service in diagnosis, risk assessment, monitoring, telehealthcare, disinfection, 
and several other operations during this pandemic which has helped reduce the 
workload of the frontline workers remarkably. The long-awaited vaccine discovery 
of this deadly virus has also been greatly accelerated with AI-empowered tools. 
In addition to that, many robotics and Robotics Process Automation platforms 
have substantially facilitated the distribution of the vaccine in many 
arrangements pertaining to it. These forefront technologies have also aided in 
giving comfort to the people dealing with less addressed mental health 
complicacies. This paper investigates the use of robotics and artificial 
intelligence-based technologies and their applications in healthcare to fight 
against the COVID-19 pandemic. A systematic search following the Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) method is 
conducted to accumulate such literature, and an extensive review on 147 selected 
records is performed.

Additive manufacturing is promising a flexible and economical alternative to 
traditional manufacturing. Aviation industry is one such sector that additive 
manufacturing brought about major transformations. Wire arc additive 
manufacturing plays an important role in aviation companies to reduce carbon 
emissions, increase efficiency and allow tailor-made components. However, there 
are some technical challenges such as microstructural porosity and voids that 
need to be addressed before they go into full-fledge adoption. Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) can play a key role in porosity detection. However, 
applicability of AI for porosity detection is limited due to the difficulties in 
collecting large amounts of data. The present article demonstrates machine 
learning models for porosity detection in microstructural images of wire-arc 
additively manufactured aluminium alloy 6061 parts with limited dataset. 
Segmentation of pores from microstructures is performed based on pixel-level 
color and texture features obtained by using Gabor filters. The machine learning 
models, whose hyperparameters are chosen from cross-validation, achieved an 
average classification accuracy of 98.89 % (random forest) for porosity 
detection with pores above the size of 5 μm. Experimental results show that the 
proposed methods are very effective when compared to the recently proposed 
methods in the literature.

Our understanding of chronic pain and the underlying molecular mechanisms 
remains limited due to a lack of tools to identify the complex phenomena 
responsible for exaggerated pain behaviours. Furthermore, currently there is no 
objective measure of pain with current assessment relying on patient 
self-scoring. Here, we applied a fully biologically unsupervised technique of 
hyperspectral autofluorescence imaging to identify a complex signature 
associated with chronic constriction nerve injury known to cause allodynia. The 
analysis was carried out using deep learning/artificial intelligence methods. 
The central element was a deep learning autoencoder we developed to condense the 
hyperspectral channel images into a four- colour image, such that spinal cord 
tissue based on nerve injury status could be differentiated from control tissue. 
This study provides the first validation of hyperspectral imaging as a tool to 
differentiate tissues from nerve injured vs non-injured mice. The 
auto-fluorescent signals associated with nerve injury were not diffuse 
throughout the tissue but formed specific microscopic size regions. Furthermore, 
we identified a unique fluorescent signal that could differentiate spinal cord 
tissue isolated from nerve injured male and female animals. The identification 
of a specific global autofluorescence fingerprint associated with nerve injury 
and resultant neuropathic pain opens up the exciting opportunity to develop a 
diagnostic tool for identifying novel contributors to pain in individuals.

BACKGROUND: Individuals with schizophrenia exhibit deficits in visual contrast 
processing, though less is known about how these deficits impact neurocognition 
and functional outcomes. This study investigated effects of contrast sensitivity 
(CS) on cognition and capacity for independent living in schizophrenia.
METHODS: Participants were 58 patients with schizophrenia (n = 49) and 
schizoaffective disorder (n = 9). Patients completed a psychophysical paradigm 
to obtain CS with stimuli consisting of grating patterns of low (0.5 and 1 
cycles/degree) and high spatial frequencies (4, 7, 21 cycles/degree). Patients 
completed the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery and Wechsler Adult 
Intelligence Scales, Third Edition to assess cognition, and the problem-solving 
factor of the Independent Living Scales to assess functional capacity. We 
computed bivariate correlation coefficients for all pairs of variables and 
tested mediation models with CS to low (CS-LSF) and high spatial frequencies 
(CS-HSF) as predictors, cognitive measures as mediators, and capacity for 
independent living as an outcome.
RESULTS: Cognition mediated the relationship between CS and independent living 
with CS-LSF a stronger predictor than CS-HSF. Mediation effects were strongest 
for perceptual organization and memory-related domains. In an expanded moderated 
mediation model, CS-HSF was found to be a significant predictor of independent 
living through perceptual organization as a mediator and CS-LSF as a moderator 
of this relationship.
CONCLUSION: CS relates to functional capacity in schizophrenia through 
neurocognition. These relationships may inform novel visual remediation 
interventions.

AIM: We aimed to investigate the effect of short-term pirfenidone treatment on 
prolonged COVID-19 pneumonia.
METHOD: Hospital files of patients hospitalised with a diagnosis of critical 
COVID-19 pneumonia from November 2020 to March 2021 were retrospectively 
reviewed. Chest computed tomography images taken both before treatment and 
2 months after treatment, demographic characteristics and laboratory parameters 
of patients receiving pirfenidone + methylprednisolone (n = 13) and only 
methylprednisolones (n = 9) were recorded. Pulmonary function tests were 
performed after the second month of the treatment. CT involvement rates were 
determined by machine learning.
RESULTS: A total of 22 patients, 13 of whom (59.1%) were using 
methylprednisolone + pirfenidone and 9 of whom (40.9%) were using only 
methylprednisolone were included. When the blood gas parameters and pulmonary 
function tests of the patients were compared at the end of the second month, it 
was found that the FEV1, FEV1%, FVC and FVC% values were statistically 
significantly higher in the methylprednisolone + pirfenidone group compared with 
the methylprednisolone group (P = .025, P = .012, P = .026 and P = .017, 
respectively). When the rates of change in CT scans at diagnosis and second 
month of treatment were examined, it was found that the involvement rates in the 
methylprednisolone + pirfenidone group were statistically significantly 
decreased (P < .001).
CONCLUSION: Antifibrotic agents can reduce fibrosis that may develop in the 
future. These can also help dose reduction and/or non-use strategy for 
methylprednisolone therapy, which has many side effects. Further large series 
and randomised controlled studies are needed on this subject.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recent studies have suggested that maternal obesity 
during pregnancy is associated with differences in neurodevelopmental outcomes 
in children. In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationships between 
maternal obesity during pregnancy and neonatal brain cortical development.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-four healthy women (28 normal-weight, 16 obese) 
were prospectively recruited at <10 weeks' gestation, and their healthy 
full-term neonates (23 boys, 21 girls) underwent brain MR imaging. All pregnant 
women had their body composition (fat mass percentage) measured at ∼12 weeks of 
pregnancy. All neonates were scanned at ∼2 weeks of age during natural sleep 
without sedation, and their 3D T1-weighted images were postprocessed by the new 
iBEAT2.0 software. Brain MR imaging segmentation and cortical surface 
reconstruction and parcellation were completed using age-appropriate templates. 
Mean cortical thickness for 34 regions in each brain hemisphere defined by the 
UNC Neonatal Cortical Surface Atlas was measured, compared between groups, and 
correlated with maternal body fat mass percentage, controlled for neonate sex 
and race, postmenstrual age at MR imaging, maternal age at pregnancy, and the 
maternal intelligence quotient and education.
RESULTS: Neonates born to obese mothers showed significantly lower (P ≤ .05, 
false discovery rate-corrected) cortical thickness in the left pars opercularis 
gyrus, left pars triangularis gyrus, and left rostral middle frontal gyrus. Mean 
cortical thickness in these frontal lobe regions negatively correlated (R = 
-0.34, P = .04; R = -0.50, P = .001; and R = -0.42, P = .01; respectively) with 
the maternal body fat mass percentage measured at early pregnancy.
CONCLUSIONS: Maternal obesity during pregnancy is associated with lower neonate 
brain cortical thickness in several frontal lobe regions important for language 
and executive functions.

To evaluate the moral awareness of college students regarding artificial 
intelligence (AI) systems, we have examined 467 surveys collected from 152 
Japanese and 315 non-Japanese students in an international university in Japan. 
The students were asked to choose a most significant moral problem of AI 
applications in the future from a list of ten ethical issues and to write an 
essay about it. The results show that most of the students (n = 269, 58%) 
considered unemployment to be the major ethical issue related to AI. The second 
largest group of students (n = 54, 12%) was concerned with ethical issues 
related to emotional AI, including the impact of AI on human behavior and 
emotion and robots' rights and emotions. A relatively small number of students 
referred to the risk of social control by AI (6%), AI discrimination (6%), 
increasing inequality (5%), loss of privacy (4%), AI mistakes (3%), malicious AI 
(3%), and AI security breaches (3%). Calculation of the z score for two 
population proportions shows that Japanese students were much less concerned 
about AI control of society (- 3.1276, p < 0.01) than non-Japanese students, but 
more concerned about discrimination (2.2757, p < 0.05). Female students were 
less concerned about unemployment (- 2.6108, p < 0.01) than males, but more 
concerned about discrimination (2.4333, p < 0.05). The study concludes that the 
moral awareness of college students regarding AI technologies is quite limited 
and recommends including the ethics of AI in the curriculum.

Careless response in the investigation of emotional intelligence has not been 
explicitly addressed. In a sample of 180 Spanish adults responding to the 
Wong-Law Emotional Intelligence Scale, a small prevalence (7.2%) was detected. 
The impact was small on the psychometric parameters, but they were less 
inflated, more realistic, and precise.

of Breast Cancer, Giza, Egypt.

OBJECTIVE: To study the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the 
performance of mammogram with regard to the classification of the detected 
breast lesions in correlation to ultrasound-aided mammograms.
METHODS: Ethics committee approval was obtained in this prospective analysis. 
The study included 2000 mammograms. The mammograms were interpreted by the 
radiologists and breast ultrasound was performed for all cases. The Breast 
Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) score was applied regarding the 
combined evaluation of the mammogram and the ultrasound modalities. Each breast 
side was individually assessed with the aid of AI scanning in the form of 
targeted heat-map and then, a probability of malignancy (abnormality scoring 
percentage) was obtained. Operative and the histopathology data were the 
standard of reference.
RESULTS: Normal assigned cases (BI-RADS 1) with no lesions were excluded from 
the statistical evaluation. The study included 538 benign and 642 malignant 
breast lesions (n = 1180, 59%). BI-RADS categories for the breast lesions with 
regard to the combined evaluation of the digital mammogram and ultrasound were 
assigned BI-RADS 2 (Benign) in 385 lesions with AI median value of the 
abnormality scoring percentage of 10 (n = 385/1180, 32.6%), and BI-RADS 5 
(malignant) in 471, that had showed median percentage AI value of 88 (n = 
471/1180, 39.9%). AI abnormality scoring of 59% yielded a sensitivity of 96.8% 
and specificity of 90.1% in the discrimination of the breast lesions detected on 
the included mammograms.
CONCLUSION: AI could be considered as an optional primary reliable complementary 
tool to the digital mammogram for the evaluation of the breast lesions. The 
color hue and the abnormality scoring percentage presented a credible method for 
the detection and discrimination of breast cancer of near accuracy to the breast 
ultrasound. So consequently, AI- mammogram combination could be used as a one 
setting method to discriminate between cases that require further imaging or 
biopsy from those that need only time interval follows up.
ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: Recently, the indulgence of AI in the work-up of breast 
cancer was concerned. AI noted as a screening strategy for the detection of 
breast cancer. In the current work, the performance of AI was studied with 
regard to the diagnosis not just the detection of breast cancer in the 
mammographic-detected breast lesions. The evaluation was concerned with AI as a 
possible complementary reading tool to mammogram and included the qualitative 
assessment of the color hue and the quantitative integration of the abnormality 
scoring percentage.

Graph models of the brain hold great promise as a framework to study functional 
and structural brain connectivity across scales and species. The network-based 
statistic (NBS) is a well-known tool for performing statistical inference on 
brain graphs, which controls the family-wise error rate in a mass univariate 
analysis by combining the cluster-based permutation technique and the 
graph-theoretical concept of connected components. As the NBS is based on 
group-level inference statistics, it does not inherently enable informed 
decisions at the level of individuals, which is, however, necessary for the 
realm of precision medicine. Here we introduce NBS-Predict, a new approach that 
combines the powerful features of machine learning (ML) and the NBS in a 
user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI). By combining ML models with 
connected components in a cross-validation (CV) structure, the new methodology 
provides a fast and convenient tool to identify generalizable neuroimaging-based 
biomarkers. The purpose of this paper is to (i) introduce NBS-Predict and 
evaluate its performance using two sets of simulated data with known ground 
truths, (ii) demonstrate the application of NBS-Predict in a real case-control 
study, including resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) 
data acquired from patients with schizophrenia, (iii) evaluate NBS-Predict using 
rs-fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project 1200 subjects release. We found 
that: (i) NBS-Predict achieved good statistical power on two sets of simulated 
data; (ii) NBS-Predict classified schizophrenia with an accuracy of 90% using 
subjects' functional connectivity matrices and identified a subnetwork with 
reduced connections in the group with schizophrenia, mainly comprising brain 
regions localized in frontotemporal, visual, and motor areas, as well as in the 
subcortex; (iii) NBS-Predict also predicted general intelligence scores from 
resting-state fMRI connectivity matrices with a prediction score of r = 0.2 and 
identified a large-scale subnetwork associated with general intelligence. 
Overall results showed that NBS-Predict performed comparable to or better than 
pre-existing feature selection algorithms (lasso, elastic net, top 5%, p-value 
thresholding) and connectome-based predictive modeling (CPM) in terms of

BACKGROUND: Convolutional neural networks (artificial intelligence, AI) are 
rapidly appearing within the field of dermatology, with diagnostic accuracy 
matching that of dermatologists. As technologies become available for use by 
both the health professionals and the general public, their uptake in healthcare 
will become more acceptable. National Health Service England recognizes the 
potential of AI for healthcare but emphasizes that patient-centred care should 
be at the forefront of these technological advancements.
AIM: To obtain opinions of patients on the use of AI in a dermatology setting, 
when aiding the diagnosis of skin cancers.
METHODS: A cross-sectional 14-point questionnaire was handed out to patients 
attending dermatology outpatient skin cancer clinics in two UK hospitals, 
between March and August 2018.
RESULTS: In total, 603 patient questionnaires were completed. Nearly half (47%; 
n = 282) of respondents were not concerned if AI technology was used by a skin 
specialist to aid skin cancer diagnosis. However, the majority (81%; n = 491) of 
respondents, considered it important for a dermatologist to examine and confirm 
a diagnosis and to be present for discussion of a cancer diagnosis.
CONCLUSION: Although the majority of respondents were not reluctant about the 
use of AI for skin cancer diagnosis, respondents still considered it important 
that dermatologists are involved in the diagnosis and/or confirmation of skin 
cancer. Furthermore, the study results demonstrate that personal interaction 
with a clinician is important. This is in keeping with proposals that AI be used 
as an adjunctive technology to increase accuracy of skin cancer diagnoses, but 
not as a substitute for a dermatologist.

With vast interest in machine learning applications, more investigators are 
proposing to assemble large datasets for machine learning applications. We aim 
to delineate multiple possible roadblocks to exam retrieval that may present 
themselves and lead to significant time delays. This HIPAA-compliant, 
institutional review board-approved, retrospective clinical study required 
identification and retrieval of all outpatient and emergency patients undergoing 
abdominal and pelvic computed tomography (CT) at three affiliated hospitals in 
the year 2012. If a patient had multiple abdominal CT exams, the first exam was 
selected for retrieval (n=23,186). Our experience in attempting to retrieve 
23,186 abdominal CT exams yielded 22,852 valid CT abdomen/pelvis exams and 
identified four major categories of challenges when retrieving large datasets: 
cohort selection and processing, retrieving DICOM exam files from PACS, data 
storage, and non-recoverable failures. The retrieval took 3 months of project 
time and at minimum 300 person-hours of time between the primary investigator (a 
radiologist), a data scientist, and a software engineer. Exam selection and 
retrieval may take significantly longer than planned. We share our experience so 
that other investigators can anticipate and plan for these challenges. We also 
hope to help institutions better understand the demands that may be placed on 
their infrastructure by large-scale medical imaging machine learning projects.

Radiology is at the forefront of the artificial intelligence transformation of 
health care across multiple areas, from patient selection to study acquisition 
to image interpretation. Needing large data sets to develop and train these 
algorithms, developers enter contractual data sharing agreements involving data 
derived from health records, usually with postacquisition curation and 
annotation. In 2019 the ACR convened a Data Sharing Workgroup to develop 
philosophies around best practices in the sharing of health information. The 
workgroup identified five broad domains of activity important to collaboration 
using patient data: privacy, informed consent, standardization of data elements, 
vendor contracts, and data valuation. This is Part 1 of a Report on the 
workgroup's efforts in exploring these issues.

Long-duration space missions to Mars will impose extreme stresses of physical 
and psychological nature on the crew, as well as significant logistical and 
technical challenges for life support and transportation. Main challenges 
include optimising overall mass and maintaining crew physical and mental health. 
These key scopes have been taken up as the baseline for a study by the European 
Space Agency (ESA) using its Concurrent Design Facility (CDF). It focussed on 
the biology of hibernation in reducing metabolism and hence stress, and its 
links to the infrastructure and life support. We concluded that torpor of crew 
members can reduce the payload with respect to oxygen, food and water but will 
require monitoring and artificial intelligence (AI) assisted monitoring of the 
crew. These studies additionally offer new potential applications for patient 
care on Earth. Keywords: Space flight, concurrent design facility, metabolic 
reduction.

Protein amino acid sequences can be used to determine the functions of the 
protein. However, determining the function of a single protein requires many 
resources and a tremendous amount of time. Computational Intelligence methods 
such as Deep learning have been shown to predict the proteins' functions. This 
paper proposes a hybrid deep neural network model to predict an unknown 
protein's functions from sequences. The proposed model is named 
Deep_CNN_LSTM_GO. Deep_CNN_LSTM_GO is an Integration between Convolutional 
Neural network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network to learn 
features from amino acid sequences and outputs the three different Gene Ontology 
(GO). The gene ontology represents the protein functions in the three 
sub-ontologies: Molecular Functions (MF), Biological Process (BP), and Cellular 
Component (CC). The proposed model has been trained and tested using 
UniProt-SwissProt's dataset. Another test has been done using Computational 
Assessment of Function Annotation (CAFA) on the three sub-ontologies. The 
proposed model outperforms different methods proposed in the field with better 
performance using three different evaluation metrics (Fmax, Smin, and AUPR) in 
the three sub-ontologies (MF, BP, CC).

Our brain can be recognized as a network of largely hierarchically organized 
neural circuits that operate to control specific functions, but when acting in 
parallel, enable the performance of complex and simultaneous behaviors. Indeed, 
many of our daily actions require concurrent information processing in 
sensorimotor, associative, and limbic circuits that are dynamically and 
hierarchically modulated by sensory information and previous learning. This 
organization of information processing in biological organisms has served as a 
major inspiration for artificial intelligence and has helped to create in silico 
systems capable of matching or even outperforming humans in several specific 
tasks, including visual recognition and strategy-based games. However, the 
development of human-like robots that are able to move as quickly as humans and 
respond flexibly in various situations remains a major challenge and indicates 
an area where further use of parallel and hierarchical architectures may hold 
promise. In this article we review several important neural and behavioral 
mechanisms organizing hierarchical and predictive processing for the acquisition 
and realization of flexible behavioral control. Then, inspired by the 
organizational features of brain circuits, we introduce a multi-timescale 
parallel and hierarchical learning framework for the realization of versatile 
and agile movement in humanoid robots.

Intelligent microfluidics is an emerging cross-discipline research area formed 
by combining microfluidics with machine learning. It uses the advantages of 
microfluidics, such as high throughput and controllability, and the powerful 
data processing capabilities of machine learning, resulting in improved systems 
in biotechnology and chemistry. Compared to traditional microfluidics using 
manual analysis methods, intelligent microfluidics needs less human 
intervention, and results in a more user-friendly experience with faster 
processing. There is a paucity of literature reviewing this burgeoning and 
highly promising cross-discipline. Therefore, we herein comprehensively and 
systematically summarize several aspects of microfluidic applications enabled by 
machine learning. We list the types of microfluidics used in intelligent 
microfluidic applications over the last five years, as well as the machine 
learning algorithms and the hardware used for training. We also present the most 
recent advances in key technologies, developments, challenges, and the emerging 
opportunities created by intelligent microfluidics.

The vastness of the design space that is created by the combination of numerous 
computational mechanisms, including machine learning, is an obstacle to creating 
artificial general intelligence (AGI). Brain-inspired AGI development; that is, 
the reduction of the design space to resemble a biological brain more closely, 
is a promising approach for solving this problem. However, it is difficult for 
an individual to design a software program that corresponds to the entire brain 
as the neuroscientific data that are required to understand the architecture of 
the brain are extensive and complicated. The whole-brain architecture approach 
divides the brain-inspired AGI development process into the task of designing 
the brain reference architecture (BRA), which provides the flow of information 
and a diagram of the corresponding components, and the task of developing each 
component using the BRA. This is known as BRA-driven development. Another 
difficulty lies in the extraction of the operating principles that are necessary 
for reproducing the cognitive-behavioral function of the brain from neuroscience 
data. Therefore, this study proposes structure-constrained interface 
decomposition (SCID), which is a hypothesis-building method for creating a 
hypothetical component diagram that is consistent with neuroscientific findings. 
The application of this approach has been initiated for constructing various 
regions of the brain. In the future, we will examine methods for evaluating the 
biological plausibility of brain-inspired software. This evaluation will also be 
used to prioritize different computational mechanisms, which should be 
integrated and associated with the same regions of the brain.

As the human cost of the pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is still being witnessed worldwide, the 
development of broad-spectrum antiviral agents against emerging and re-emerging 
viruses is seen as a necessity to hamper the spread of infections. Various 
targets during the viral life-cycle can be considered to inhibit viral 
infection, from viral attachment to viral fusion or replication. Macromolecules 
represent a particularly attractive class of therapeutics due to their 
multivalency and versatility. Although several antiviral macromolecules hold 
great promise in clinical applications, the emergence of resistance after 
prolonged exposure urges the need for improved solutions. In the present 
article, the recent advancement in the discovery of antiviral peptides and 
polymers with diverse structural features and antiviral mechanisms is reviewed. 
Future perspectives, such as, the development of virucidal peptides/polymers and 
their coatings against SARS-CoV-2 infection, standardization of antiviral 
testing protocols, and use of artificial intelligence or machine learning as a 
tool to accelerate the discovery of antiviral macromolecules, are discussed.

3M syndrome is characterized by severe pre- and post-natal growth restriction, 
typical face, slender tubular bones, tall vertebral bodies, prominent heels and 
normal intelligence. It is caused by biallelic variants of CUL7, OBSL1 and, more 
rarely, CCDC8. The aim of this study is to evaluate facial and skeletal findings 
in 3M patients from neonatal period to adulthood. A total of 19 patients with a 
median age of diagnosis of 9.2 months were included in this study and were 
followed for two to 20 years. CUL7 and OBSL1 variants were found in 57.9% and 
42.1% of patients, respectively, five of which are novel. Most of patients had 
triangular face, frontal bossing, short fleshy nose, full fleshy lower lip, 
transverse groove of rib cage, hyperlordosis and prominent heels. Three new 
early-diagnostic signs were observed in infants; two were infraorbital swelling 
of the lower lid and facial infantile hemangioma, both of which became less 
pronounced with aging. The third was the central tubercle of the upper lip that 
became more prominent with in time. While slender long bones did not change with 
aging, the tall vertebral bodies became more prominent radiologically. The mean 
birth length in patients was -4.3 SDS. Eight patients reached a mean final 
height of -4.9 SDS. Despite described growth hormone (GH) insensitivity in 3M 
syndrome, 12 patients either with GH deficiency or with normal GH levels were 
treated with GH; seven patients responded with an increase in height SDS. This 
study not only provided early diagnostic signs of the syndrome, but also 
presented important follow-up findings.

In silico driven optimization of compound properties related to 
pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety is a key requirement in modern 
drug discovery. Nowadays, large and harmonized datasets allow to implement deep 
neural networks (DNNs) as a framework for leveraging predictive models. 
Nevertheless, various available model architectures differ in their global 
applicability and performance in lead optimization projects, such as stability 
over time and interpretability of the results. Here, we describe and compare the 
value of established DNN-based methods for the prediction of key ADME property 
trends and biological activity in an industrial drug discovery environment, 
represented by microsomal lability, CYP3A4 inhibition and factor Xa inhibition. 
Three architectures are exemplified, our earlier described multilayer perceptron 
approach (MLP), graph convolutional network-based models (GCN) and a vector 
representation approach, Mol2Vec. From a statistical perspective, MLP and GCN 
were found to perform superior over Mol2Vec, when applied to external validation 
sets. Interestingly, GCN-based predictions are most stable over a longer period 
in a time series validation study. Apart from those statistical observations, 
DNN prove of value to guide local SAR. To illustrate this important aspect in 
pharmaceutical research projects, we discuss challenging applications in 
medicinal chemistry towards a more realistic picture of artificial intelligence 
in drug discovery.

BACKGROUND: Cultural awareness is an important part of organizational success 
when interacting with multiple cultures. Research has shown a dearth of 
standardized cultural awareness training programs for non-governmental 
humanitarian organization staff.
PURPOSE: This study aims to develop an expert-consensus set of cultural 
awareness competencies as the basis for development of humanitarian staff 
cultural awareness trainings.
METHODS: A modified Delphi process was selected. The first round of surveys 
collected a list of cultural awareness competencies from experts in the fields 
of non-governmental organization (NGO) operations and cultural awareness 
education and research. This collated list of competencies was then used as the 
basis of a survey obtaining ratings by the group on a five-point Likert scale. 
Competencies which achieved an average rating of 4.0 or higher were considered 
to be "important" for inclusion in future training programs.
RESULTS: A total of 67.9% of contacted experts agreed to participate, with 84.2% 
of those completing all rounds of the survey. This group developed a list of ten 
competencies, including: Cultural Awareness/Sensitivity and Intercultural 
Communication; Cultural Intelligence; Unconscious Bias/Diversity Awareness; a 
Universal Declaration of Ethical Principles; Gender and Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, 
Transgender, Queer, and Other Sexual Identities (LGBTQ+) Issues and Safety; 
Analytical and Critical Thinking Skills; Negotiation; Program Mission; Power 
Dynamics; and Empathy.
CONCLUSIONS: This study defined a set of ten expert-consensus cultural awareness 
competencies which can be a basis for future NGO staff training. Future work can 
both use these competencies to create educational programs and further define 
and expand the set of competencies based on analyses of their implementation.

BACKGROUND: Retained surgical items are a serious human error. Surgical sponges 
account for 70% of retained surgical items. To prevent retained surgical 
sponges, it is important to establish a system that can identify errors and 
avoid the occurrence of adverse events. To date, no computer-aided diagnosis 
software specialized for detecting retained surgical sponges has been reported. 
We developed a software program that enables easy and effective computer-aided 
diagnosis of retained surgical sponges with high sensitivity and specificity 
using the technique of deep learning, a subfield of artificial intelligence.
STUDY DESIGN: In this study, we developed the software by training it through 
deep learning using a dataset and then validating the software. The dataset 
consisted of a training set and validation set. We created composite x-rays 
consisting of normal postoperative x-rays and surgical sponge x-rays for a 
training set (n = 4,554) and a validation set (n = 470). Phantom x-rays (n = 12) 
were prepared for software validation. X-rays obtained with surgical sponges 
inserted into cadavers were used for validation purposes (formalin: Thiel's 
method = 252:117). In addition, postoperative x-rays without retained surgical 
sponges were used for the validation of software performance to determine 
false-positive rates. Sensitivity, specificity, and false positives per image 
were calculated.
RESULTS: In the phantom x-rays, both the sensitivity and specificity in software 
image interpretation were 100%. The software achieved 97.7% sensitivity and 
83.8% specificity in the composite x-rays. In the normal postoperative x-rays, 
86.6% specificity was achieved. In reading the cadaveric x-rays, the software 
attained both sensitivity and specificity of >90%.
CONCLUSIONS: Software with high sensitivity for diagnosis of retained surgical 
sponges was developed successfully.

BACKGROUND: Interest in artificial intelligence-driven analysis of medical 
images has seen a steep increase in recent years. Thus, our paper aims to 
promote and facilitate the use of this state-of-the-art technology to fellow 
researchers and clinicians.
NEW METHOD: We present custom deep learning models generated in DeePathology™ 
STUDIO without the need for background knowledge in deep learning and computer 
science underlined by practical suggestions.
RESULTS: We describe the general workflow in this commercially available 
software and present three real-world examples how to detect microglia on 
IBA1-stained mouse brain sections including their differences, validation 
results and analysis of a sample slide.
COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: Deep-learning assisted analysis of 
histological images is faster than classical analysis methods, and offers a wide 
variety of detection possibilities that are not available using methods based on 
staining intensity.
CONCLUSIONS: Reduced researcher bias, increased speed and extended possibilities 
make deep-learning assisted analysis of histological images superior to 
traditional analysis methods for histological images.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the level of agreement between the conventional method and 
a machine-learning approach to facial midline determination and asymmetry 
assessment.
SETTINGS AND SAMPLE POPULATION: The study included a total of 90 samples (53 
females; 37 males) with different levels of mandibular asymmetry.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two researchers placed predefined soft tissue landmarks 
individually on selected facial frontal photographs and created 10 reference 
lines. The midsagittal line was determined as perpendicular to the midpoint of 
the bipupillary line, and the same two reference lines and facial landmarks were 
automatically determined by the software using machine-learning algorithms, and 
researchers created the other 8 reference lines using the facial landmarks that 
were determined automatically by the software. In the following stage, 2 linear 
and 10 angular measurements were made by a single researcher on 270 photographs, 
and the consistency and differences between the measurements were evaluated with 
a one-sample t test, an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and 
Bland-Altman Plots.
RESULTS: The level of agreement of measurements between the researchers and the 
software was low for eight parameters (ICC˂0.70). The one-sample t test revealed 
that differences between the software and researcher measurements of lip canting 
and pronasale deviation were not statistically significantly different 
(P > .05). Aside from the body inclination difference in Group 3 (samples with a 
mandibular body inclination difference >6°), there was no clinically significant 
difference (˂3°) between the measurements of the two methods.
CONCLUSIONS: Machine-learning algorithms have the potential for clinical use in 
asymmetry assessment and midline determination and can help clinicians in a 
manual approach.

The beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is a 
transmembrane aspartyl-protease, that cleaves amyloid precursor protein (APP) at 
the β-site. The sequential proteolytic cleavage of APP, first by β-secretase and 
then by γ-secretase complex, leads to the production and release of amyloid-β 
peptide, a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). BACE1 inhibitors 
are reported to possess considerable potential in decreasing the level of 
amyloid-β in brain and preventing the progression of AD. A classification study 
has been conducted on 3536 diverse BACE1 inhibitors, obtained from Binding DB 
database, by extracting two types of descriptors, that is molecular property 
(Mordred) and fingerprints (Pubchem, MACCS and KRFP). Furthermore, based on the 
descriptors, various machine learning algorithms such as Naïve Bayesian (NB), 
nearest known neighbours (kNN), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF) 
and gradient-boosted algorithms (XGB) were applied to develop classification 
models. The performance of models was evaluated by using accuracy, precision, 
recall and F1 score of test set. The best NB, kNN, SVM, RF and XGB classifiers 
had F1 score of 0.74, 0.85, 0.86, 0.87 and 0.87, respectively. The diverse 3536 
BACE1 inhibitors were clustered into 11 subsets, and the structural features of 
each subset were evaluated. The important fragments present in active and 
inactive compounds were also identified. The model developed in the study would 
serve as a valuable tool for the designing of BACE1 inhibitors, and also in 
virtual screening of molecules to identify these.

Semantic Snapping for Guided Multi-View Visualization Design.

Kristiansen YS, Garrison L, Bruckner S.

Visual information displays are typically composed of multiple visualizations 
that are used to facilitate an understanding of the underlying data. A common 
example are dashboards, which are frequently used in domains such as finance, 
process monitoring and business intelligence. However, users may not be aware of 
existing guidelines and lack expert design knowledge when composing such 
multi-view visualizations. In this paper, we present semantic snapping, an 
approach to help non-expert users design effective multi-view visualizations 
from sets of pre-existing views. When a particular view is placed on a canvas, 
it is "aligned" with the remaining views-not with respect to its geometric 
layout, but based on aspects of the visual encoding itself, such as how data 
dimensions are mapped to channels. Our method uses an on-the-fly procedure to 
detect and suggest resolutions for conflicting, misleading, or ambiguous 
designs, as well as to provide suggestions for alternative presentations. With 
this approach, users can be guided to avoid common pitfalls encountered when 
composing visualizations. Our provided examples and case studies demonstrate the 
usefulness and validity of our approach.

SightBi: Exploring Cross-View Data Relationships with Biclusters.

Sun M, Shaikh AR, Alhoori H, Zhao J.

Multiple-view visualization (MV) has been heavily used in visual analysis tools 
for sensemaking of data in various domains (e.g., bioinformatics, cybersecurity 
and text analytics). One common task of visual analysis with multiple views is 
to relate data across different views. For example, to identify threats, an 
intelligence analyst needs to link people from a social network graph with 
locations on a crime-map, and then search for and read relevant documents. 
Currently, exploring cross-view data relationships heavily relies on 
view-coordination techniques (e.g., brushing and linking), which may require 
significant user effort on many trial-and-error attempts, such as repetitiously 
selecting elements in one view, and then observing and following elements 
highlighted in other views. To address this, we present SightBi, a visual 
analytics approach for supporting cross-view data relationship explorations. We 
discuss the design rationale of SightBi in detail, with identified user tasks 
regarding the use of cross-view data relationships. SightBi formalizes 
cross-view data relationships as biclusters, computes them from a dataset, and 
uses a bi-context design that highlights creating stand-alone 
relationship-views. This helps preserve existing views and offers an overview of 
cross-view data relationships to guide user exploration. Moreover, SightBi 
allows users to interactively manage the layout of multiple views by using newly 
created relationship-views. With a usage scenario, we demonstrate the usefulness 
of SightBi for sensemaking of cross-view data relationships.

PURPOSE: Cognitive decline is frequently observed after chemotherapy. As 
chemotherapy is associated with changes in brain white matter microstructure, we 
investigated whether white matter microstructure before chemotherapy is a risk 
factor for cognitive decline after chemotherapy.
METHODS: Neuropsychologic tests were administered before and 6 months (n = 49), 
2 years (n = 32), and 3 years (n = 32) after chemotherapy in patients with 
breast cancer receiving anthracycline-based chemotherapy (BC + CT group), at 
matched intervals to patients with BC who did not receive systemic therapy (BC - 
CT group: n = 39, 23, and 19, respectively) and to no-cancer controls (NC group: 
n = 37, 29, and 28, respectively). Using multivariate normative comparison, we 
evaluated to what extent the cognitive profiles of patients deviated from those 
of controls. Fractional anisotropy (FA), derived from magnetic resonance 
diffusion tensor imaging, was used to measure white matter microstructure before 
treatment. FA was evaluated as a risk factor for cognitive decline, in addition 
to baseline age, fatigue, cognitive complaints, and premorbid intelligence 
quotient. We subsequently ran voxel-wise diffusion tensor imaging analyses to 
investigate white matter microstructure in specific nerve tracts.
RESULTS: Low FA independently predicted cognitive decline early (6 months, P = 
.013) and late (3 years, P < .001) after chemotherapy. FA did not predict 
cognitive decline in the BC - CT and NC groups. Voxel-wise analysis indicated 
involvement of white matter tracts essential for cognitive functioning.
CONCLUSION: Low FA may reflect low white matter reserve. This may be a risk 
factor for cognitive decline after chemotherapy for BC. If validated in future 
trials, identification of patients with low white matter reserve could improve 
patient care, for example, by facilitating targeted, early interventions or even 
by influencing choices of patients and doctors for receiving chemotherapy.

Quality management has been part of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation 
(HSCT) from the very beginning. It evolved step-wise from open data exchange up 
to the introduction of the FACT/JACIE-based quality management system (QMS) 2 
decades ago. This formal step has eased cooperation, and improved outcome for 
patients. Today's expansion of cellular and targeted therapies and new drugs, 
and the regulatory requirements for advanced therapeutic medicinal products have 
touched the limits of the current system. Based on the Medicine 4.0 concept, the 
next step should integrate novel views of QMS. The old definition "Best Quality 
Transplant" will be replaced by "Optimal Treatment," and encompass the entire 
health care journey. "Best outcome" will refer to overall survival, quality of 
life and costs, with or without HSCT, and will be compatible with all 
requirements by competent authorities. Decisions will be based on high-level 
evidence, supported by real-time digitized data collection, data analysis, 
incorporated into artificial-intelligence systems. To reach this goal, 
EBMT/JACIE will be challenged to start the process by further fostering 
harmonization within and between organizations at institutional, national, and 
European levels. Acceleration in information technology and modifications to 
working practices during the pandemic should facilitate this development to the 
next stage.

Prediction of cognitive ability latent factors such as general intelligence from 
neuroimaging has elucidated questions pertaining to their neural origins. 
However, predicting general intelligence from functional connectivity limit 
hypotheses to that specific domain, being agnostic to time-distributed features 
and dynamics. We used an ensemble of recurrent neural networks to circumvent 
this limitation, bypassing feature extraction, to predict general intelligence 
from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging regional signals of a 
large sample (n = 873) of Human Connectome Project adult subjects. Ablating 
common resting-state networks (RSNs) and measuring degradation in performance, 
we show that model reliance can be mostly explained by network size. Using our 
approach based on the temporal variance of saliencies, that is, gradients of 
outputs with regards to inputs, we identify a candidate set of networks that 
more reliably affect performance in the prediction of general intelligence than 
similarly sized RSNs. Our approach allows us to further test the effect of local 
alterations on data and the expected changes in derived metrics such as 
functional connectivity and instantaneous innovations.

OBJECTIVES: Radiomics is the conversion of medical images into quantitative 
high-dimensional data. Laryngeal cancer, one of the most common head and neck 
cancers, has risen globally by 58.7%. CT, MRI and PET are acquired during the 
diagnostic process providing potential data for radiomic analysis and 
correlation with outcomes.This review aims to examine the applications of this 
technique to laryngeal cancer and the future considerations for translation into 
clinical practice.
METHODS: A comprehensive systematic review-informed search of the MEDLINE and 
EMBASE databases was undertaken. Keywords "laryngeal cancer" OR "larynx" OR 
"larynx cancer" OR "head and neck cancer" were combined with "radiomic" OR 
"signature" OR "machine learning" OR "artificial intelligence". Additional 
articles were obtained from bibliographies using the "snowball method".
RESULTS: The included studies (n = 15) demonstrated that radiomic features are 
significantly associated with various clinical outcomes (including stage, 
overall survival, treatment response, progression-free survival) and that 
predictive models incorporating radiomic features are superior to those that do 
not. Two studies demonstrated radiomics could improve laryngeal cancer staging 
whilst 12 studies affirmed its predictive capability for clinical outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Radiomics has potential for improving multiple aspects of laryngeal 
cancer care; however, the heterogeneous cohorts and lack of data on laryngeal 
cancer exclusively inhibits firm conclusions. Large prospective well-designed 
studies in laryngeal cancer are required to progress this field. Furthermore, to 
implement radiomics into clinical practice, a unified research effort is 
required to standardise radiomics practice.
ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: This review has highlighted the value of radiomics in 
enhancing laryngeal cancer care (including staging, prognosis and predicting 
treatment response).

OBJECTIVE: Machine learning (ML) is expected to play an increasing role within 
primary health care (PHC) in coming years. No peer-reviewed studies exist that 
evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of ML models compared to general practitioners 
(GPs). The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of an ML 
classifier on primary headache diagnoses in PHC, compare its performance to GPs, 
and examine the most impactful signs and symptoms when making a prediction.
DESIGN: A retrospective study on diagnostic accuracy, using electronic health 
records from the database of the Primary Health Care Service of the Capital Area 
(PHCCA) in Iceland.
SETTING: Fifteen primary health care centers of the PHCCA.
SUBJECTS: All patients that consulted a physician, from 1 January 2006 to 30 
April 2020, and received one of the selected diagnoses.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sensitivity, Specificity, Positive Predictive Value, 
Matthews Correlation Coefficient, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, 
and Area under the ROC curve (AUROC) score for primary headache diagnoses, as 
well as Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) values of the ML classifier.
RESULTS: The classifier outperformed the GPs on all metrics except specificity. 
The SHAP values indicate that the classifier uses the same signs and symptoms 
(features) as a physician would, when distinguishing between headache diagnoses.
CONCLUSION: In a retrospective comparison, the diagnostic accuracy of the ML 
classifier for primary headache diagnoses is superior to GPs. According to SHAP 
values, the ML classifier relies on the same signs and symptoms as a physician 
when making a diagnostic prediction.KeypointsLittle is known about the 
diagnostic accuracy of machine learning (ML) in the context of primary health 
care, despite its considerable potential to aid in clinical work. This novel 
research sheds light on the diagnostic accuracy of ML in a clinical context, as 
well as the interpretation of its predictions. If the vast potential of ML is to 
be utilized in primary health care, its performance, safety, and inner workings 
need to be understood by clinicians.

Combined ultrasound and photoacoustic (USPA) imaging has attracted several 
pre-clinical and clinical applications due to its ability to simultaneously 
display structural, functional, and molecular information of deep biological 
tissue in real time. However, the depth and wavelength dependent optical 
attenuation and the unknown optical and acoustic heterogeneities limit the USPA 
imaging performance in deep tissue regions. Novel instrumentation, image 
reconstruction, and artificial intelligence (AI) methods are currently being 
investigated to overcome these limitations and improve the USPA image quality. 
Effective implementation of these approaches requires a reliable USPA simulation 
tool capable of generating US based anatomical and PA based molecular contrasts 
of deep biological tissue. Here, we developed a hybrid USPA simulation platform 
by integrating finite element models of light (NIRFast) and ultrasound (k-Wave) 
propagations for co-simulation of B-mode US and PA images. The platform allows 
optimization of different design parameters for USPA devices, such as the 
aperture size and frequency of both light and ultrasound detector arrays. For 
designing tissue-realistic digital phantoms, a dictionary-based function has 
been added to k-Wave to generate various levels of ultrasound speckle contrast. 
The feasibility of modeling US imaging combined with optical fluence dependent 
multispectral PA imaging is demonstrated using homogeneous as well as 
heterogeneous tissue phantoms mimicking human organs (e.g., prostate and 
finger). In addition, we also demonstrate the potential of the simulation 
platform to generate large scale application-specific training and test datasets 
for AI enhanced USPA imaging. The complete USPA simulation codes together with 
the supplementary user guides have been posted to an open-source repository 
(https://github.com/KothapalliLabPSU/US-PA_simulation_codes).

Epigenetic research holds great promise to advance our understanding of 
biomarkers and regulatory processes in health and disease. An increasing number 
of new approaches, ranging from molecular to biophysical analyses, enable 
identifying epigenetic changes on the level of a single gene or the whole 
epigenome. The aim of this review is to highlight how the field is shifting from 
completely molecular-biology-driven solutions to multidisciplinary strategies 
including more reliance on biophysical analysis tools. Biophysics not only 
offers technical advancements in imaging or structure analysis but also helps to 
explore regulatory interactions. New computational methods are also being 
developed to meet the demand of growing data volumes and their processing. 
Therefore, it is important to capture these new directions in epigenetics from a 
biophysical perspective and discuss current challenges as well as multiple 
applications of biophysical methods and tools. Specifically, we gradually 
introduce different biophysical research methods by first considering the 
DNA-level information and eventually higher-order chromatin structures. 
Moreover, we aim to highlight that the incorporation of bioinformatics, machine 
learning, and artificial intelligence into biophysical analysis allows gaining 
new insights into complex epigenetic processes. The gained understanding has 
already proven useful in translational and clinical research providing better 
patient stratification options or new therapeutic insights. Together, this 
offers a better readiness to transform bench-top experiments into industrial 
high-throughput applications with a possibility to employ developed methods in 
clinical practice and diagnostics.

Many environmental chemicals are being identified as suspected neurotoxicants 
based on the findings of both experimental and epidemiological studies. 
Organophosphate esters (OPEs), which are among the chemicals that have replaced 
neurotoxic polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) after 2004, have also become 
an important public health topic as evidence regarding their potential for 
early-life neurotoxicity is growing. In 233 mother child pairs from Cincinnati, 
OH, we measured concentrations of the OPE metabolites bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) 
phosphate (BDCIPP), bis-2-chloroethyl phosphate (BCEP), diphenyl phosphate 
(DPHP), and di-n-butyl phosphate (DNBP) in the urine of pregnant women at 16 and 
26 weeks gestation and at delivery. At age 8 years, we assessed children's 
cognition using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-IV. In models 
adjusted for maternal race, income, body mass index, and IQ, maternal urinary 
BCEP was associated with a modest increase in child full-scale IQ (ß: 0.81 per a 
ln-unit BCEP increase; 95 % CI: 0.00, 1.61) while other OPEs were not associated 
with changes in full-scale IQ or any IQ subscales. Maternal serum PBDE 
concentrations did not confound the relationships between urinary OPE 
metabolites and child IQ. Using Bayesian kernel machine regression, we did not 
find that concentrations of a mixture of OPE metabolites during gestation was 
associated with any child cognition measures. The results of this study are not 
consistent with other published work, and a larger sample size would be 
beneficial to explore potential associations more fully. Therefore, additional 
studies are necessary to continue studying prenatal OPE exposure and child 
neurodevelopment and behavior.

Background Previous studies suggest that use of artificial intelligence (AI) 
algorithms as diagnostic aids may improve the quality of skeletal age 
assessment, though these studies lack evidence from clinical practice. Purpose 
To compare the accuracy and interpretation time of skeletal age assessment on 
hand radiograph examinations with and without the use of an AI algorithm as a 
diagnostic aid. Materials and Methods In this prospective randomized controlled 
trial, the accuracy of skeletal age assessment on hand radiograph examinations 
was performed with (n = 792) and without (n = 739) the AI algorithm as a 
diagnostic aid. For examinations with the AI algorithm, the radiologist was 
shown the AI interpretation as part of their routine clinical work and was 
permitted to accept or modify it. Hand radiographs were interpreted by 93 
radiologists from six centers. The primary efficacy outcome was the mean 
absolute difference between the skeletal age dictated into the radiologists' 
signed report and the average interpretation of a panel of four radiologists not 
using a diagnostic aid. The secondary outcome was the interpretation time. A 
linear mixed-effects regression model with random center- and radiologist-level 
effects was used to compare the two experimental groups. Results Overall mean 
absolute difference was lower when radiologists used the AI algorithm compared 
with when they did not (5.36 months vs 5.95 months; P = .04). The proportions at 
which the absolute difference exceeded 12 months (9.3% vs 13.0%, P = .02) and 24 
months (0.5% vs 1.8%, P = .02) were lower with the AI algorithm than without it. 
Median radiologist interpretation time was lower with the AI algorithm than 
without it (102 seconds vs 142 seconds, P = .001). Conclusion Use of an 
artificial intelligence algorithm improved skeletal age assessment accuracy and 
reduced interpretation times for radiologists, although differences were 
observed between centers. Clinical trial registration no. NCT03530098 © RSNA,

BACKGROUND: The widespread popularity of browlifts and blepharoplasties speaks 
directly to the importance that patients place on the periorbital region of the 
face. In literature, most esthetic outcomes are based on instinctive analysis of 
the esthetic surgeon, rather than on patient assessments, public opinions, or 
other objective means. We employed an artificial intelligence system to 
objectively measure the impact of brow lifts and associated rejuvenation 
procedures on the appearance of emotion while the patient is in repose.
METHODS: We retrospectively identified all patients who underwent bilateral brow 
lift for visual field obstruction between 2006 and 2019. Images were analyzed 
using a commercially available facial expression recognition software package 
(FaceReader™, Noldus Information Technology BV, Wageningen, Netherlands). The 
data generated reflected the proportion of each emotion expressed for any given 
facial movement and the action units associated.
RESULTS: A total of 52 cases were identified after exclusion. Pre-operatively, 
the angry, happy, sad, scared, and surprised emotion were detected on average of 
13.06%, 1.68%, 13.06%, 3.53%, and 0.97% among all the patients, respectively. 
Post-operatively, the angry emotion average decreased to 5.42% (p=0.009). The 
happy emotion increased to 9.35% (p=0.0013), while the sad emotion decreased to 
5.42%. The scared emotion remained relatively the same at 3.4%, and the 
surprised emotion increased to 2.01%; however, these were not statistically 
significant.
CONCLUSION: This study proposes a paradigm shift in the clinical evaluation of 
brow lift and other facial esthetic surgery, implementing an existing facial 
emotion recognition system to quantify changes in expression associated with 
facial surgery.

Computed tomography has gained an important role in the early diagnosis of 
COVID-19 pneumonia. However, the ever-increasing number of patients has 
overwhelmed radiology departments and has caused a reduction in quality of 
services. Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are the remedy to the current 
situation. However, the lack of application in real-world conditions has limited 
their consideration in clinical settings. This study validated a clinical AI 
system, COVIDiag, to aid radiologists in accurate and rapid evaluation of 
COVID-19 cases. 50 COVID-19 and 50 non-COVID-19 pneumonia cases were included 
from each of five centers: Argentina, Turkey, Iran, Netherlands, and Italy. The 
Dutch database included only 50 COVID-19 cases. The performance parameters 
namely sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and area under the ROC curve (AUC) 
were computed for each database using COVIDiag model. The most common pattern of 
involvement among COVID-19 cases in all databases were bilateral involvement of 
upper and lower lobes with ground-glass opacities. The best sensitivity of 92.0% 
was recorded for the Italian database. The system achieved an AUC of 0.983, 
0.914, 0.910, and 0.882 for Argentina, Turkey, Iran, and Italy, respectively. 
The model obtained a sensitivity of 86.0% for the Dutch database. COVIDiag model 
could diagnose COVID-19 pneumonia in all of cohorts with AUC of 0.921 
(sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 88.8%, 87.0%, and 88.0%, 
respectively). Our study confirmed the accuracy of our proposed AI model 
(COVIDiag) in the diagnosis of COVID-19 cases. Furthermore, the system 
demonstrated consistent optimal diagnostic performance on multinational 
databases, which is critical to determine the generalizability and objectivity 
of the proposed COVIDiag model. Our results are significant as they provide 
real-world evidence regarding the applicability of AI systems in clinical 
medicine.

The adenoma detection rate is the constant subject of research and the main 
marker of quality in bowel cancer screening. However, by improving the quality 
of endoscopy via artificial intelligence methods, all polyps, including those 
with the potential for malignancy, can be removed, thereby reducing interval 
colorectal cancer rates. As such, the removal of all polyps may become the best 
marker of endoscopy quality. Thus, we present a viewpoint on integrating the 
computer-aided detection (CADe) of polyps with high-accuracy, real-time 
colonoscopy to challenge quality improvements in the performance of colonoscopy. 
Colonoscopy for bowel cancer screening involving the integration of a deep 
learning methodology (ie, integrating artificial intelligence with CADe systems) 
has been assessed in an effort to increase the adenoma detection rate. In this 
viewpoint, a few studies are described, and their results show that CADe systems 
are able to increase screening sensitivity. The detection of adenomatous polyps, 
which are associated with a potential risk of progression to colorectal cancer, 
and their removal are expected to reduce cancer incidence and mortality rates. 
However, so far, artificial intelligence methods do not increase the detection 
of cancer or large adenomatous polyps but contribute to the detection of small 
precancerous polyps.

In genetics and related fields, huge amounts of data, such as genome sequences, 
are accumulating, and the use of artificial intelligence (AI) suitable for big 
data analysis has become increasingly important. Unsupervised AI that can reveal 
novel knowledge from big data without prior knowledge or particular models is 
highly desirable for analyses of genome sequences, particularly for obtaining 
unexpected insights. We have developed a batch-learning self-organizing map 
(BLSOM) for oligonucleotide compositions that can reveal various novel genome 
characteristics. Here, we explain the data mining by the BLSOM: an unsupervised 
AI. As a specific target, we first selected SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2) because a large number of viral genome sequences have 
been accumulated via worldwide efforts. We analyzed more than 0.6 million 
sequences collected primarily in the first year of the pandemic. BLSOMs for 
short oligonucleotides (e.g., 4-6-mers) allowed separation into known clades, 
but longer oligonucleotides further increased the separation ability and 
revealed subgrouping within known clades. In the case of 15-mers, there is 
mostly one copy in the genome; thus, 15-mers that appeared after the epidemic 
started could be connected to mutations, and the BLSOM for 15-mers revealed the 
mutations that contributed to separation into known clades and their subgroups. 
After introducing the detailed methodological strategies, we explain BLSOMs for 
various topics, such as the tetranucleotide BLSOM for over 5 million 5-kb 
fragment sequences derived from almost all microorganisms currently available 
and its use in metagenome studies. We also explain BLSOMs for various 
eukaryotes, including fishes, frogs and Drosophila species, and found a high 
separation ability among closely related species. When analyzing the human 
genome, we found enrichments in transcription factor-binding sequences in 
centromeric and pericentromeric heterochromatin regions. The tDNAs (tRNA genes) 
could be separated according to their corresponding amino acid.

OBJECTIVE: Artificial intelligence (AI) offers new opportunities for objective 
quantitative measurements of imaging biomarkers from positron-emission 
tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). Clinical image reporting relies 
predominantly on observer-dependent visual assessment and easily accessible 
measures like SUVmax, representing lesion uptake in a relatively small amount of 
tissue. Our hypothesis is that measurements of total volume and lesion uptake of 
the entire tumour would better reflect the disease`s activity with prognostic 
significance, compared with conventional measurements.
METHODS: An AI-based algorithm was trained to automatically measure the prostate 
and its tumour content in PET/CT of 145 patients. The algorithm was then tested 
retrospectively on 285 high-risk patients, who were examined using 18F-choline 
PET/CT for primary staging between April 2008 and July 2015. Prostate tumour 
volume, tumour fraction of the prostate gland, lesion uptake of the entire 
tumour, and SUVmax were obtained automatically. Associations between these 
measurements, age, PSA, Gleason score and prostate cancer-specific survival were 
studied, using a Cox proportional-hazards regression model.
RESULTS: Twenty-three patients died of prostate cancer during follow-up (median 
survival 3.8 years). Total tumour volume of the prostate (p = 0.008), tumour 
fraction of the gland (p = 0.005), total lesion uptake of the prostate 
(p = 0.02), and age (p = 0.01) were significantly associated with 
disease-specific survival, whereas SUVmax (p = 0.2), PSA (p = 0.2), and Gleason 
score (p = 0.8) were not.
CONCLUSION: AI-based assessments of total tumour volume and lesion uptake were 
significantly associated with disease-specific survival in this patient cohort, 
whereas SUVmax and Gleason scores were not. The AI-based approach appears 
well-suited for clinically relevant patient stratification and monitoring of

INTRODUCTION: The identification of C-shaped root canal anatomy on radiographic 
images affects clinical decision making and treatment. The aims of this study 
were to develop a deep learning (DL) model to classify C-shaped canal anatomy in 
mandibular second molars from cone-beam computed tomographic (CBCT) volumes and 
to compare the performance of 3 different architectures.
METHODS: U-Net, residual U-Net, and Xception U-Net architectures were used for 
image segmentation and classification of C-shaped anatomies. Model training and 
validation were performed on 100 of a total of 135 available limited field of 
view CBCT images containing mandibular molars with C-shaped anatomy. Thirty-five 
CBCT images were used for testing. Voxel-matching accuracy of the automated 
labeling of the C-shaped anatomy was assessed with the Dice index. The mean 
sensitivity of predicting the correct C-shape subcategory was calculated based 
on detection accuracy. One-way analysis of variance and post hoc Tukey honestly 
significant difference tests were used for statistical evaluation.
RESULTS: The mean Dice coefficients were 0.768 ± 0.0349 for Xception U-Net, 
0.736 ± 0.0297 for residual U-Net, and 0.660 ± 0.0354 for U-Net on the test data 
set. The performance of the 3 models was significantly different overall 
(analysis of variance, P = .000779). Both Xception U-Net (Q = 7.23, P = .00070) 
and residual U-Net (Q = 5.09, P = .00951) performed significantly better than 
U-Net (post hoc Tukey honestly significant difference test). The mean 
sensitivity values were 0.786 ± 0.0378 for Xception U-Net, 0.746 ± 0.0391 for 
residual U-Net, and 0.720 ± 0.0495 for U-Net. The mean positive predictive 
values were 77.6% ± 0.1998% for U-Net, 78.2% ± 0.0.1971% for residual U-Net, and 
80.0% ± 0.1098% for Xception U-Net. The addition of contrast-limited adaptive 
histogram equalization had improved overall architecture efficacy by a mean of 
4.6% (P < .0001).
CONCLUSIONS: DL may aid in the detection and classification of C-shaped canal 
anatomy.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Current artificial intelligence (AI)-based solutions for 
capsule endoscopy (CE) interpretation are proprietary. We aimed to evaluate an 
AI solution trained on a specific CE system (Pillcam®, Medtronic) for the 
detection of angiectasias on images captured by a different proprietary system 
(MiroCam®, Intromedic).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: An advanced AI solution (Axaro®, Augmented Endoscopy), 
previously trained on Pillcam® small bowell images, was evaluated on independent 
datasets with more than 1200 Pillcam® and MiroCam® still frames (equally 
distributed, with or without angiectasias). Images were reviewed by experts 
before and after AI interpretation.
RESULTS: Sensitivity for the diagnosis of angiectasia was 97.4% with Pillcam® 
images and 96.1% with Mirocam® images, with specificity of 98.8% and 97.8%, 
respectively. Performances regarding the delineation of regions of interest and 
the characterization of angiectasias were similar in both groups (all above 
95%). Processing time was significantly shorter with Mirocam® (20.7 ms) than 
with Pillcam® images (24.6 ms, p<0.0001), possibly related to technical 
differences between systems.
CONCLUSION: This proof-of-concept study on still images paves the way for the 
development of resource-sparing, "universal" CE databases and AI solutions for 
CE interpretation.

Children with Cerebral Palsy (CP) often perform poorly in mathematics. It is not 
yet clear to what extent mathematics difficulties in this clinical condition are 
similar to those observed in developmental dyscalculia. To better elucidate this 
issue, we conducted an exploratory cross-sectional study with a sample of 
children and adolescents with congenital brain injuries and educational history 
of problems in Mathematics. Fifty students aged 7-15 years, of both genders (28 
males) participated in the study, 31 with typical development (TD) and 19 of 
whom diagnosed with spastic CP. Nine had hemiplegia and ten diplegia. Assessment 
procedures included a neuropsychological battery covering numerical cognition 
(ZAREKI-R) and working memory (AWMA) skills, and a computerized task for 
comparing non-symbolic magnitudes as a measure of number sense. Despite average 
intelligence coefficient, participants with CP underperformed the TD in five of 
the 12 ZAREKI-R subtests, as well as in the number sense and working memory 
tasks. scores were lower among hemiplegic children compared to diplegic, 
numerical cognition was impaired in all CP group, unveiling a dyscalculia 
secondary to neurodevelopmental impairments. Therefore, we can consider that 
mathematical learning difficulties in CP as being heterogeneous and associated 
with the immaturity of neuropsychological functions, with consequences for the 
development of numerical cognition.

The concentration of soluble salts in surface water and rivers such as sodium, 
sulfate, chloride, magnesium ions, etc., plays an important role in the water 
salinity. Therefore, accurate determination of the distribution pattern of these 
ions can improve better management of drinking water resources and human health. 
The main goal of this research is to establish two novel wavelet-complementary 
intelligence paradigms so-called wavelet least square support vector machine 
coupled with improved simulated annealing (W-LSSVM-ISA) and the wavelet extended 
Kalman filter integrated with artificial neural network (W-EKF- ANN) for 
accurate forecasting of the monthly), magnesium (Mg+2), and sulfate (SO4-2) 
indices at Maroon River, in Southwest of Iran. The monthly River flow (Q), 
electrical conductivity (EC), Mg+2, and SO4-2 data recorded at Tange-Takab 
station for the period 1980-2016. Some preprocessing procedures consisting of 
specifying the number of lag times and decomposition of the existing original 
signals into multi-resolution sub-series using three mother wavelets were 
performed to develop predictive models. In addition, the best subset regression 
analysis was designed to separately assess the best selective combinations for 
Mg+2 and SO4-2. The statistical metrics and authoritative validation approaches 
showed that both complementary paradigms yielded promising accuracy compared 
with standalone artificial intelligence (AI) models. Furthermore, the results 
demonstrated that W-LSSVM-ISA-C1 (correlation coefficient (R) = 0.9521, root 
mean square error (RMSE) = 0.2637 mg/l, and Kling-Gupta efficiency 
(KGE) = 0.9361) and W-LSSVM-ISA-C4 (R = 0.9673, RMSE = 0.5534 mg/l and 
KGE = 0.9437), using Dmey mother that outperformed the W-EKF-ANN for predicting 
Mg+2 and SO4-2, respectively.

The physiological mechanisms of age-related cognitive decline remain unclear, in 
no small part due to the lack of longitudinal studies. Extant longitudinal 
studies focused on gross neuroanatomy and diffusion properties of the brain. We 
present herein a longitudinal analysis of changes in arterial pulsatility - a 
proxy for arterial stiffness - in two major cerebral arteries, middle cerebral 
and vertebral. We found that pulsatility increased in some participants over a 
relatively short period and these increases were associated with hippocampal 
shrinkage. Higher baseline pulsatility was associated with lower scores on a 
test of fluid intelligence at follow-up. This is the first longitudinal evidence 
of an association between increase in cerebral arterial stiffness over time and 
regional shrinkage.

BACKGROUND: Nursing students must learn about the core values of nursing care. 
Thus, education designed to improve their caring ability should be included in 
nursing curricula. Nursing students' caring ability is reportedly affected by 
emotional intelligence and resilience. However, no studies have explored whether 
these qualities have mediating effects on the relationship between nursing 
students' type D personality and their caring ability.
OBJECTIVES: To examine the mediating effects of emotional intelligence and 
resilience on the relationship between type D personality and caring ability in 
nursing students.
DESIGN: A cross-sectional, descriptive survey study.
SETTING: The study was conducted in South Korea.
PARTICIPANTS: 278 nursing students.
METHODS: Type D personality, emotional intelligence, resilience, and caring 
ability were measured using questionnaires. Data were analyzed using Pearson's 
correlations, regression analysis, and Hayes' Process Macro using the bootstrap 
method.
RESULTS: Results indicated that type D personality significantly predicted 
emotional intelligence (B = -6.80, p < .001), resilience (B = -6.77, p < .001), 
and caring ability (B = -7.20, p = .001). Emotional intelligence mediated the 
relationship between type D personality and caring ability.
CONCLUSION: Interventions to improve the caring ability of nursing students 
should include an evaluation of nursing students' emotional intelligence and 
strategies to promote their emotional intelligence.

Catania, Catania, Italy.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the accuracy of automatic deep learning-based method for 
fully automatic segmentation of the mandible from CBCTs.
SETTING AND SAMPLE POPULATION: CBCT-derived mandible fully automatic 
segmentation.
METHODS: Forty CBCT scans from healthy patients (20 females and 20 males, mean 
age 23.37 ± 3.34) were collected, and a manual mandible segmentation was carried 
out by using Mimics software. Twenty CBCT scans were randomly selected and used 
for training the artificial intelligence model file. The remaining 20 CBCT 
segmentation masks were used to test the accuracy of the CNN automatic method by 
comparing the segmentation volumes of the 3D models obtained with automatic and 
manual segmentations. The accuracy of the CNN-based method was also assessed by 
using the DICE Score coefficient (DSC) and by the surface-to-surface matching 
technique. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Dahlberg's formula 
were used respectively to test the intra-observer reliability and method error. 
Independent Student's t test was used for between-groups volumetric comparison.
RESULTS: Measurements were highly correlated with an ICC value of 0.937, while 
the method error was 0.24 mm3 . A difference of 0.71 (±0.49) cm3 was found 
between the methodologies, but it was not statistically significant (P > .05). 
The matching percentage detected was 90.35% (±1.88) (tolerance 0.5 mm) and 
96.32% ± 1.97% (tolerance 1.0 mm). The differences, measured as DSC in 
percentage, between the assessments done with both methods were, respectively, 
2.8% and 3.1%.
CONCLUSION: The tested deep learning CNN-based technology is accurate and 
performs as well as an experienced image reader but at much higher speed, which 
is of significant clinical relevance.

Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.

BACKGROUND: To investigate the refractive outcomes of second-eye adjustment 
(SEA) methods in different intraocular lens (IOL) power calculation formulas for 
second eye following bilateral sequential cataract surgery.
METHODS: This retrospective consecutive case-series study included 234 eyes from 
234 patients who underwent bilateral sequential phacoemulsification and 
implantation of enVista MX60 in a hospital setting. Postoperative refraction 
outcomes calculated by standard formulas (SRK/T and Barrett Universal II, BUII) 
with SEA method were compared with those calculated by an artificial 
intelligence-based IOL power calculation formula (PEARL DGS) under second eye 
enhancement (SEE) method. The median absolute error (MedAE), mean absolute error 
(MAE) and percentage prediction errors (PE) of eyes within ±0.25 diopters (D), 
±0.50 D, ±0.75 D and ± 1.00 D were determined.
RESULTS: Overall, the improvement in MedAE after SEA was significant for PEARL 
DGS (p < 0.01), SRK/T (p < 0.001) and BUII (p = 0.031), which increased from 
74.36, 71.37, and 77.78% to 83.33, 80.34, and 79.49% of eyes within a PE of 
±0.50 D, respectively. For first eyes with a medium axial length (22-26 mm), 
PEARL DGS with SEE had the lowest MedAE (0.21 D). For a first-eye MAE over 0.50 
D, SEA method led to significant improvement in the second eye (p < 0.01). 
Interocular axis length differences exceeding 0.3 mm were associated with weaker 
effects using SEA in the studied formulas (p > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Either SEA method with SRK/T and BUII formulas or second-eye 
enhancement method based on the PEARL DGS formula can improve postoperative 
refractive outcomes in second eye.

BACKGROUND: Current digital cell imaging systems perform peripheral blood smear 
(PBS) analysis in limited regions of the PBS and require the support of manual 
microscopy without achieving full digital microscopy. We report a multicenter 
study that validated the Scopio Labs X100 Full Field PBS, a novel digital 
imaging system that utilizes a full field view approach for cell recognition and 
classification, in a decision support system mode.
METHODS: We analyzed 335 normal and 310 abnormal PBS from patients with various 
clinical conditions and compared the performance of Scopio's Full Field PBS as 
the test method, with manual PBS analysis as the reference method. Deming 
regression analysis was utilized for comparisons of WBC and platelet estimates. 
Measurements of WBC and platelet estimation accuracy along with the agreement on 
RBC morphology evaluation were performed. Reproducibility and repeatability 
(R&R) of the system were also evaluated.
RESULTS: Scopio's Full Field PBS WBC accuracy was evaluated with an efficiency 
of 96.29%, sensitivity of 87.86%, and specificity of 97.62%. The agreement 
between the test and reference method for RBC morphology reached 99.77%, and the 
accuracy for platelet estimation resulted in an efficiency of 94.89%, 
sensitivity of 90.00%, and specificity of 96.28%, with successful R&R tests. The 
system enabled a comprehensive review of full field PBS as shown in 
representative samples.
CONCLUSIONS: Scopio's Full Field PBS showed a high degree of correlation of all 
tested parameters with manual microscopy. The novel full field view of specimens 
facilitates the long-expected disengagement between the digital application and 
the manual microscope.

Evidence-based teaching practices (EBPs) foster college science, technology, 
engineering, and mathematics (STEM) students' engagement and performance, yet 
our knowledge of what contributes to the effectiveness of these practices is 
less established. We propose a framework that links four social-cognitive 
variables-students' trust in their instructors, growth mindset, buy-in to 
instructional practices, and course engagement-to long-standing desired student 
outcomes of academic performance and intent to persist in science. This 
framework was tested in classrooms identified as having a high level of EBP 
implementation with a multi-institutional sample of 2102 undergraduates taught 
by 14 faculty members. Results indicate that the buy-in framework is a valid 
representation of college students' learning experiences within EBP contexts 
overall as well as across underrepresented student groups. In comparison to 
students' level of growth mindset, students' trust in their instructors was more 
than twice as predictive of buy-in to how the course was being taught, 
suggesting that students' views of their instructors are more associated with 
thriving in a high-EBP course environment than their views of intelligence. This 
study contributes to the dialogue on transforming undergraduate STEM education 
by providing a validated student buy-in framework as a lens to understand how 
EBPs enhance student outcomes.

Significance: Accurately predicting wound healing trajectories is difficult for 
wound care clinicians due to the complex and dynamic processes involved in wound 
healing. Wound care teams capture images of wounds during clinical visits 
generating big datasets over time. Developing novel artificial intelligence (AI) 
systems can help clinicians diagnose, assess the effectiveness of therapy, and 
predict healing outcomes. Recent Advances: Rapid developments in computer 
processing have enabled the development of AI-based systems that can improve the 
diagnosis and effectiveness of therapy in various clinical specializations. In 
the past decade, we have witnessed AI revolutionizing all types of medical 
imaging like X-ray, ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, 
etc., but AI-based systems remain to be developed clinically and computationally 
for high-quality wound care that can result in better patient outcomes. Critical 
Issues: In the current standard of care, collecting wound images on every 
clinical visit, interpreting and archiving the data are cumbersome and time 
consuming. Commercial platforms are developed to capture images, perform wound 
measurements, and provide clinicians with a workflow for diagnosis, but AI-based 
systems are still in their infancy. This systematic review summarizes the 
breadth and depth of the most recent and relevant work in intelligent 
image-based data analysis and system developments for wound assessment. Future 
Directions: With increasing availabilities of massive data (wound images, 
wound-specific electronic health records, etc.) as well as powerful computing 
resources, AI-based digital platforms will play a significant role in delivering 
data-driven care to people suffering from debilitating chronic wounds.

BACKGROUND: Emotional intelligence training relieves stress and promotes 
resilience among nurses. Previous studies have not sufficiently explored the 
effect of emotional intelligence training among nurses on the experience of 
inpatients under their care.
OBJECTIVE: To explore the effects of emotional intelligence training on 
emotional intelligence, resilience, and perceived stress among nurses and 
examine how training affects inpatient experience.
DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial.
SETTING: A tertiary general hospital in Changsha, China.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 103 nurses were randomly selected from 20 wards.
METHODS: The wards were randomized into two groups. The intervention group 
(n = 53 nurses) received emotional intelligence training in two phases: Phase 
I-system training phase, twice a week for one month; Phase II-a consolidated 
learning phase, once a week for 11 months. The control group (n = 50) received 
daily briefings in meetings between head nurses, which were held regularly to 
discuss specific problems. There was no emotional intelligence training 
conducted with the control group. Data were collected at baseline and after the 
intervention.
RESULTS: Emotional intelligence training improved emotional intelligence, 
resilience, and stress in the intervention group. The control group scored lower 
on the Wong and Law's Emotional Intelligence Scale and all subscales, showed 
stability in the scores on the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale and its 
subscales, and very little change in stress scores. Repeated measures analysis 
of variance showed significantly greater beneficial changes in the intervention 
group on all but the optimism subscale. There were suggestive differences in the 
predicted direction between the emotional intelligence training wards and the 
control wards at post-test on the patient experience scale and the four 
subscales.
CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that emotional intelligence training improves 
emotional intelligence, resilience, and stress among nurses and leads to 
improvements in inpatient experience. Emotional intelligence training should be 
part of nurse education to improve the quality of care nurses provide and their 
ability to work without increased stress.

Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is one of the most prevalent 
muscular dystrophies characterized by considerable variability in severity, 
rates of progression and functional outcomes. Few studies follow FSHD cohorts 
long enough to understand predictors of disease progression and functional 
outcomes, creating gaps in our understanding, which impacts clinical care and 
the design of clinical trials. Efforts to identify molecularly targeted 
therapies create a need to better understand disease characteristics with 
predictive value to help refine clinical trial strategies and understand trial 
outcomes. Here we analysed a prospective cohort from a large, longitudinally 
followed registry of patients with FSHD in the USA to determine predictors of 
outcomes such as need for wheelchair use. This study analysed de-identified data 
from 578 individuals with confirmed FSHD type 1 enrolled in the United States 
National Registry for FSHD Patients and Family members. Data were collected from 
January 2002 to September 2019 and included an average of 9 years (range 0-18) 
of follow-up surveys. Data were analysed using descriptive epidemiological 
techniques, and risk of wheelchair use was determined using Cox proportional 
hazards models. Supervised machine learning analysis was completed using Random 
Forest modelling and included all 189 unique features collected from registry 
questionnaires. A separate medications-only model was created that included 359 
unique medications reported by participants. Here we show that smaller allele 
sizes were predictive of earlier age at onset, diagnosis and likelihood of 
wheelchair use. Additionally, we show that females were more likely overall to 
progress to wheelchair use and at a faster rate as compared to males, 
independent of genetics. Use of machine learning models that included all 
reported clinical features showed that the effect of allele size on progression 
to wheelchair use is small compared to disease duration, which may be important 
to consider in trial design. Medical comorbidities and medication use add to the 
risk for need for wheelchair dependence, raising the possibility for better 
medical management impacting outcomes in FSHD. The findings in this study will 
require further validation in additional, larger datasets but could have 
implications for clinical care, and inclusion criteria for future clinical 
trials in FSHD.

OBJECTIVES: To undertake the first systematic review examining the performance 
of artificial intelligence (AI) applied to cross-sectional imaging for the 
diagnosis of acquired pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).
METHODS: Searches of Medline, Embase and Web of Science were undertaken on 1 
July 2020. Original publications studying AI applied to cross-sectional imaging 
for the diagnosis of acquired PAH in adults were identified through two-staged 
double-blinded review. Study quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment 
of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies and Checklist for Artificial Intelligence in 
Medicine frameworks. Narrative synthesis was undertaken following Synthesis 
Without Meta-Analysis guidelines. This review received no funding and was 
registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews 
(ID:CRD42020196295).
RESULTS: Searches returned 476 citations. Three retrospective observational 
studies, published between 2016 and 2020, were selected for data-extraction. Two 
methods applied to cardiac-MRI demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy, with the 
best model achieving AUC=0.90 (95% CI: 0.85-0.93), 89% sensitivity and 81% 
specificity. Stronger results were achieved using cardiac-MRI for classification 
of idiopathic PAH, achieving AUC=0.97 (95% CI: 0.89-1.0), 96% sensitivity and 
87% specificity. One study reporting CT-based AI demonstrated lower accuracy, 
with 64.6% sensitivity and 97.0% specificity.
CONCLUSIONS: Automated methods for identifying PAH on cardiac-MRI are emerging 
with high diagnostic accuracy. AI applied to cross-sectional imaging may provide 
non-invasive support to reduce diagnostic delay in PAH. This would be helped by 
stronger solutions in other modalities.
ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: There is a significant shortage of research in this 
important area. Early detection of PAH would be supported by further research 
advances on the promising emerging technologies identified.

First two decades of the twenty-first century are characterised by epidemics of 
non-communicable diseases such as many hundreds of millions of patients 
diagnosed with cardiovascular diseases and the type 2 diabetes mellitus, breast, 
lung, liver and prostate malignancies, neurological, sleep, mood and eye 
disorders, amongst others. Consequent socio-economic burden is tremendous. 
Unprecedented decrease in age of maladaptive individuals has been reported. The 
absolute majority of expanding non-communicable disorders carry a chronic 
character, over a couple of years progressing from reversible suboptimal health 
conditions to irreversible severe pathologies and cascading collateral 
complications. The time-frame between onset of SHS and clinical manifestation of 
associated disorders is the operational area for an application of reliable risk 
assessment tools and predictive diagnostics followed by the cost-effective 
targeted prevention and treatments tailored to the person. This article 
demonstrates advanced strategies in bio/medical sciences and healthcare focused 
on suboptimal health conditions in the frame-work of Predictive, Preventive and 
Personalised Medicine (3PM/PPPM). Potential benefits in healthcare systems and 
for society at large include but are not restricted to an improved life-quality 
of major populations and socio-economical groups, advanced professionalism of 
healthcare-givers and sustainable healthcare economy. Amongst others, following 
medical areas are proposed to strongly benefit from PPPM strategies applied to 
the identification and treatment of suboptimal health conditions:Stress overload 
associated pathologiesMale and female healthPlanned pregnanciesPeriodontal 
healthEye disordersInflammatory disorders, wound healing and pain management 
with associated complicationsMetabolic disorders and suboptimal body 
weightCardiovascular pathologiesCancersStroke, particularly of unknown aetiology 
and in young individualsSleep medicineSports medicineImproved individual 
outcomes under pandemic conditions such as COVID-19.

The aims of this work were to create a robust automatic software tool for 
measurement of the levator hiatal area on transperineal ultrasound (TPUS) 
volumes and to measure the potential reduction in variability and time taken for 
analysis in a clinical setting. The proposed tool automatically detects the 
C-plane (i.e., the plane of minimal hiatal dimensions) from a 3-D TPUS volume 
and subsequently uses the extracted plane to automatically segment the levator 
hiatus, using a convolutional neural network. The automatic pipeline was tested 
using 73 representative TPUS volumes. Reference hiatal outlines were obtained 
manually by two experts and compared with the pipeline's automated outlines. The 
Hausdorff distance, area, a clinical quality score, C-plane angle and C-plane 
Euclidean distance were used to evaluate C-plane detection and quantify levator 
hiatus segmentation accuracy. A visual Turing test was created to compare the 
performance of the software with that of the expert, based on the visual 
assessment of C-plane and hiatal segmentation quality. The overall time taken to 
extract the hiatal area with both measurement methods (i.e., manual and 
automatic) was measured. Each metric was calculated both for computer-observer 
differences and for inter-and intra-observer differences. The automatic method 
gave results similar to those of the expert when determining the hiatal outline 
from a TPUS volume. Indeed, the hiatal area measured by the algorithm and by an 
expert were within the intra-observer variability. Similarly, the method 
identified the C-plane with an accuracy of 5.76 ± 5.06° and 6.46 ± 5.18 mm in 
comparison to the inter-observer variability of 9.39 ± 6.21° and 8.48 ± 6.62 mm. 
The visual Turing test suggested that the automatic method identified the 
C-plane position within the TPUS volume visually as well as the expert. The 
average time taken to identify the C-plane and segment the hiatal area manually 
was 2 min and 35 ± 17 s, compared with 35 ± 4 s for the automatic result. This 
study presents a method for automatically measuring the levator hiatal area 
using artificial intelligence-based methodologies whereby the C-plane within a 
TPUS volume is detected and subsequently traced for the levator hiatal outline. 
The proposed solution was determined to be accurate, relatively quick, robust 
and reliable and, importantly, to reduce time and expertise required for pelvic 
floor disorder assessment.

PURPOSE: Artificial intelligence (AI) is playing an ever-increasing role in 
Neuroradiology.
METHODS: When designing AI-based research in neuroradiology and appreciating the 
literature, it is important to understand the fundamental principles of AI. 
Training, validation, and test datasets must be defined and set apart as 
priorities. External validation and testing datasets are preferable, when 
feasible. The specific type of learning process (supervised vs. unsupervised) 
and the machine learning model also require definition. Deep learning (DL) is an 
AI-based approach that is modelled on the structure of neurons of the brain; 
convolutional neural networks (CNN) are a commonly used example in 
neuroradiology.
RESULTS: Radiomics is a frequently used approach in which a multitude of imaging 
features are extracted from a region of interest and subsequently reduced and 
selected to convey diagnostic or prognostic information. Deep radiomics uses 
CNNs to directly extract features and obviate the need for predefined features.
CONCLUSION: Common limitations and pitfalls in AI-based research in 
neuroradiology are limited sample sizes ("small-n-large-p problem"), selection 
bias, as well as overfitting and underfitting.

Citrobacter rodentium, a natural mouse pathogen which colonises the colon of 
immuno-competent mice, provides a robust model for interrogating 
host-pathogen-microbiota interactions in vivo. This model has been key to 
providing new insights into local host responses to enteric infection, including 
changes in intestinal epithelial cell immunometabolism and mucosal immunity. C. 
rodentium injects 31 bacterial effectors into epithelial cells via a type III 
secretion system (T3SS). Recently, these effectors were shown to be able to form 
multiple intracellular subnetworks which can withstand significant contractions 
whilst maintaining virulence. Here we highlight recent advances in understanding 
gut mucosal responses to infection and effector biology, as well as potential 
uses for artificial intelligence (AI) in understanding infectious disease and 
speculate on the role of T3SS effector networks in host adaption.

RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: There exists many single sample perspectives on 
artificial intelligence (AI). The aim of this review was to collate the current 
data on attitudes/knowledge towards AI in three unique populations: medical 
students, clinicians and patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature search was performed on PubMed, Scopus and 
Web of Science pertaining to survey data on AI in radiology. Quality assessment 
was performed by an adapted version of the assessment tool from the National 
Heart, Lung and Blood Institute for Observational Studies.
RESULTS: Fourteen studies were found on attitudes/knowledge towards AI in 
radiology. Four studies examined medical students, seven on clinicians and three 
on patient populations. Deficiencies in the literature mainly related to 
sampling bias. Students had anxiety relating to future job prospects. Clinicians 
were optimistic and viewed AI as an aid to the diagnosis and wanted to further 
their knowledge. Patients were concerned about the lack of human interaction and 
accountability during error.
CONCLUSION: Attitudes and knowledge regarding AI in radiology remains a topic 
that needs to be researched further and education given pertaining to its use in 
a clinical setting.

Alcohol use, presents unique challenges for HIV-1 treatment in adolescents with 
perinatally acquired infection. The effects of alcohol on host-virus interaction 
in the brain and the immune system remains understudied in this population. 
Adolescents with perinatally acquired HIV infection (PHIV) well established on 
ART, from the Cape Town Adolescent Antiretroviral Cohort who self-reported 
alcohol use (PHIV + alcohol) (n = 26) were compared to age matched 26 PHIV 
(PHIV-alcohol) and 26 healthy controls (HC) who reported no use of alcohol. 
Participants completed clinical investigations including highly-sensitive CRP 
(hs-CRP), a comprehensive neurocognitive test battery and mental health 
measures. In addition, we investigated the relationship between alcohol use in 
PHIV and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and structural brain magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) to determine fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), 
grey and white matter volumes and cortical thickness. PHIV (mean age 12,5 years; 
mean age of ART initiation 3.15 years) reported an occasional weekend drinking 
pattern of alcohol use. hs-CRP was significantly different between groups, with 
PHIV + alcohol higher than PHIV-alcohol and HC. General intelligence, attention, 
working memory, processing speed and executive function were more impaired in 
the PHIV + alcohol than PHIV alone, with HC having the highest scores. In 
addition, self-concept was significantly lower in PHIV + alcohol. The Child 
Behavior Checklist (CBCL) Externalizing behaviour, internalising behaviour and 
CBCL Total problems were significantly higher in PHIV + alcohol. FA of the 
superior corona radiata, superior fronto-occipital fasciculus and corpus 
callosum was significantly lower in PHIV + alcohol compared to PHIV-alcohol and 
MD of the corona radiata was significantly increased in PHIV + alcohol. The 
cortical thickness of the lateral orbitofrontal, middle frontal and precentral 
gyri were significantly lower in PHIV + alcohol compared to PHIV-alcohol and HC. 
In conclusion PHIV associated impairments in systemic inflammation, cognitive 
function, mental health and changes in brain structure may be exacerbated by 
alcohol use, even if only occasional use. However, the study is cross-sectional, 
which is not able to distinguish between cause and effect.

Artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques are breaking into 
biomedical research and health care, which importantly includes cancer research 
and oncology, where the potential applications are vast. These include detection 
and diagnosis of cancer, subtype classification, optimization of cancer 
treatment and identification of new therapeutic targets in drug discovery. While 
big data used to train machine learning models may already exist, leveraging 
this opportunity to realize the full promise of artificial intelligence in both 
the cancer research space and the clinical space will first require significant 
obstacles to be surmounted. In this Viewpoint article, we asked four experts for 
their opinions on how we can begin to implement artificial intelligence while 
ensuring standards are maintained so as transform cancer diagnosis and the 
prognosis and treatment of patients with cancer and to drive biological 
discovery.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has given the electrocardiogram (ECG) and 
clinicians reading them super-human diagnostic abilities. Trained without 
hard-coded rules by finding often subclinical patterns in huge datasets, AI 
transforms the ECG, a ubiquitous, non-invasive cardiac test that is integrated 
into practice workflows, into a screening tool and predictor of cardiac and 
non-cardiac diseases, often in asymptomatic individuals. This review describes 
the mathematical background behind supervised AI algorithms, and discusses 
selected AI ECG cardiac screening algorithms including those for the detection 
of left ventricular dysfunction, episodic atrial fibrillation from a tracing 
recorded during normal sinus rhythm, and other structural and valvular diseases. 
The ability to learn from big data sets, without the need to understand the 
biological mechanism, has created opportunities for detecting non-cardiac 
diseases as COVID-19 and introduced challenges with regards to data privacy. 
Like all medical tests, the AI ECG must be carefully vetted and validated in 
real-world clinical environments. Finally, with mobile form factors that allow 
acquisition of medical-grade ECGs from smartphones and wearables, the use of AI 
may enable massive scalability to democratize healthcare.

AIMS: Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a rapidly 
growing global health problem. To date, diagnosis of HFpEF is based on clinical, 
invasive, and laboratory examinations. Electrocardiographic findings may vary, 
and there are no known typical ECG features for HFpEF.
METHODS AND RESULTS: This study included two patient cohorts. In the derivation 
cohort, we included n = 1884 patients who presented with exertional dyspnoea or 
equivalent and preserved ejection fraction (≥50%) and clinical suspicion for 
coronary artery disease. The ECGs were divided in segments, yielding a total of 
77 558 samples. We trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify 
HFpEF and control patients according to European Society of Cardiology (ESC) 
criteria. An external group of 203 volunteers in a prospective heart failure 
screening programme served as a validation cohort of the CNN. The external 
validation of the CNN yielded an area under the curve of 0.80 [95% confidence 
interval (CI) 0.74-0.86] for detection of HFpEF according to ESC criteria, with 
a sensitivity of 0.99 (95% CI 0.98-0.99) and a specificity of 0.60 (95% CI 
0.56-0.64), with a positive predictive value of 0.68 (95%CI 0.64-0.72) and a 
negative predictive value of 0.98 (95% CI 0.95-0.99).
CONCLUSION: In this study, we report the first deep learning-enabled CNN for 
identifying patients with HFpEF according to ESC criteria including NT-proBNP 
measurements in the diagnostic algorithm among patients at risk. The suitability 
of the CNN was validated on an external validation cohort of patients at risk 
for developing heart failure, showing a convincing screening performance.

Although rates of vaccination have increased worldwide, the rise in nonmedical 
exemptions for vaccination may have caused a resurgence of childhood 
vaccine-preventable diseases. Vaccine hesitancy plays an important role in the 
decreasing rates of vaccination and is considered by the World Health 
Organization as a top ten global threat to public health. Online vaccine 
misinformation is present in news outlets, websites, and social media, and its 
rapid and extensive dissemination is aided by artificial intelligence (AI). In 
combating online misinformation, public health experts, the medical community, 
and lay vaccination advocates can correct false statements using language that 
appeal to those who are undecided about vaccination. As the gatekeepers to 
online information, they can implement and enforce policy that limits or bans 
vaccine misinformation on their platforms. AI tools might also be used to 
address misinformation, but more research is needed before implementing this 
approach more broadly in health policy. This commentary examines the role that 
different online platforms appear to be playing in the spread of misinformation 
about vaccines. We also discuss the implications of online misinformation on 
attitudes about COVID-19 vaccine uptake and provide suggestions for ways to 
combat online misinformation.

Plain Language Summary: Vaccine hesitancy, the rejection or delay to get 
vaccinated even if there is an effective vaccine available, may be instrumental 
in the resurgence of vaccine-preventable disease. Studies have shown that the 
rise in nonmedical exemptions for vaccination increases rates of childhood 
vaccine-preventable disease. One factor that influences vaccine hesitancy is 
online misinformation. False or misleading information online regarding vaccines 
can be found in independent news outlets, websites, and social media. The spread 
of vaccine misinformation is especially important during the COVID-19 pandemic 
as false information can decrease pro-vaccine opinions. The recent announcement 
of an effective COVID-19 vaccine became a hot topic online, with many adults 
hesitant to take the vaccine. Public health experts, medical professionals, and 
pro-vaccine individuals can help curb the spread of misinformation by correcting 
false statements online. Social media companies can also aid in stopping 
misinformation by implementing and enforcing policy that limits misinformation 
on their platforms.

INTRODUCTION: This study proposes a novel data pipeline based on micro-computed 
tomographic (micro-CT) data for training the U-Net network to realize the 
automatic and accurate segmentation of the pulp cavity and tooth on cone-beam 
computed tomographic (CBCT) images.
METHODS: We collected CBCT data and micro-CT data of 30 teeth. CBCT data were 
processed and transformed into small field of view and high-resolution CBCT 
images of each tooth. Twenty-five sets were randomly assigned to the training 
set and the remaining 5 sets to the test set. We used 2 data pipelines for U-Net 
network training: one manually labeled by an endodontic specialist as the 
control group and one processed from the micro-CT data as the experimental 
group. The 3-dimensional models constructed using micro-CT data in the test set 
were taken as the ground truth. The Dice similarity coefficient, precision rate, 
recall rate, average symmetric surface distance, Hausdorff distance, and 
morphologic analysis were used for performance evaluation.
RESULTS: The segmentation accuracy of the experimental group measured by the 
Dice similarity coefficient, precision rate, recall rate, average symmetric 
surface distance, and Hausdorff distance were 96.20% ± 0.58%, 97.31% ± 0.38%, 
95.11% ± 0.97%, 0.09 ± 0.01 mm, and 1.54 ± 0.51 mm in the tooth and 
86.75% ± 2.42%, 84.45% ± 7.77%, 89.94% ± 4.56%, 0.08 ± 0.02 mm, and 
1.99 ± 0.67 mm in the pulp cavity, respectively, which were better than the 
control group. Morphologic analysis suggested the segmentation results of the 
experimental group were better than those of the control group.
CONCLUSIONS: This study proposed an automatic and accurate approach for tooth 
and pulp cavity segmentation on CBCT images, which can be applied in research 
and clinical tasks.

Procedures and models of computerized data analysis are becoming researchers' 
and practitioners' thinking partners by transforming the reasoning underlying 
biomedicine. Complexity theory, Network analysis and Artificial Intelligence are 
already approaching this discipline, intending to provide support for patient's 
diagnosis, prognosis and treatments. At the same time, due to the sparsity, 
noisiness and time-dependency of medical data, such procedures are raising many 
unprecedented problems related to the mismatch between the human mind's 
reasoning and the outputs of computational models. Thanks to these 
computational, non-anthropocentric models, a patient's clinical situation can be 
elucidated in the orthodontic discipline, and the growth outcome can be 
approximated. However, to have confidence in these procedures, orthodontists 
should be warned of the related benefits and risks. Here we want to present how 
these innovative approaches can derive better patients' characterization, also 
offering a different point of view about patient's classification, prognosis and 
treatment.

Zimbabwe is among the countries affected with the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) 
and implemented several infection control and measures such as social 
distancing, contact tracing, regular temperature checking in strategic entry and 
exit points, face masking among others. The country also implemented recursive 
national lockdowns and curfews to reduce the virus transmission rate and its 
catastrophic impact. These large-scale measures are not easy to implement, 
adhere to and subsequently difficult to practice and maintain which lead to 
imperfect public compliance, especially if there is a significant impact on 
social and political norms, economy, and psychological wellbeing of the affected 
population. Also, emerging COVID-19 variants, porous borders, regular movement 
of informal traders and sale of fake vaccination certificates continue to 
threaten impressive progress made towards virus containment. Therefore, several 
emerging technologies have been adopted to strengthen the health system and 
health services delivery, improve compliance, adherence and maintain social 
distancing. These technologies use health data, symptoms monitoring, mobility, 
location and proximity data for contact tracing, self-isolation, and quarantine 
compliance. However, the use of emerging technologies has been debatable and 
contentious because of the potential violation of ethical values such as 
security and privacy, data format and management, synchronization, 
over-tracking, over-surveillance and lack of proper development and 
implementation guidelines which impact their efficacy, adoption and ultimately 
influence public trust. Therefore, the study proposes ethical framework for 
using emerging technologies to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. The framework is 
centered on ethical practices such as security, privacy, justice, human dignity, 
autonomy, solidarity, beneficence, and non-maleficence.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate an automatic, deep learning 
based method (Augmented Radiology for Vascular Aneurysm [ARVA]), to detect and 
assess maximum aortic diameter, providing cross sectional outer to outer aortic 
wall measurements.
METHODS: Accurate external aortic wall diameter measurement is performed along 
the entire aorta, from the ascending aorta to the iliac bifurcations, on both 
pre- and post-operative contrast enhanced computed tomography angiography (CTA) 
scans. A training database of 489 CTAs was used to train a pipeline of neural 
networks for automatic external aortic wall measurements. Another database of 62 
CTAs, including controls, aneurysmal aortas, and aortic dissections scanned 
before and/or after endovascular or open repair, was used for validation. The 
measurements of maximum external aortic wall diameter made by ARVA were compared 
with those of seven clinicians on this validation dataset.
RESULTS: The median absolute difference with respect to expert's measurements 
ranged from 1 mm to 2 mm among all annotators, while ARVA reported a median 
absolute difference of 1.2 mm.
CONCLUSION: The performance of the automatic maximum aortic diameter method 
falls within the interannotator variability, making it a potentially reliable 
solution for assisting clinical practice.

BACKGROUND: Stressful life events are known as risk factors for depression, 
though there is considerable heterogeneity in how people respond to stress. 
Previous studies have found an association between experience of stressful life 
events and the personality trait of openness to experience, which itself has 
been associated with intelligence, creativity, risk-taking, and other clinically 
relevant behaviors. In this study we explore the association between stressful 
life events and openness to experience as a potential developmental pathway to 
depression in the Amish and Mennonites, rural populations with high degree of 
social and environmental homogeneity.
METHODS: Participants in the Amish Connectome Project (n=531) were assessed with 
the NEO personality inventory, Beck Depression Inventory, Maryland Trait and 
State Depression scales, a Life Stressors Inventory, and cognitive tests.
RESULTS: We found that stressful life events were significantly associated with 
openness to experience; that participants with a history of depression exhibited 
higher levels of openness; and that openness to experience was related to 
overall intelligence but not processing speed or working memory. We found 
evidence that openness to experience partially mediates the relationship between 
stressful life events and depression.
LIMITATIONS: This was a cross-sectional study, limiting interpretation of causal 
pathways. High levels of inter-relatedness among participants may have led to 
exaggerated effects compared to the general population.
CONCLUSIONS: Together these findings indicate a complex developmental influence 
of major stressful life events, which paradoxically by enhancing openness may be 
associated with both greater intellectual engagement as well as psychopathology.

Purpose The objective of this study was to determine the agreement of kinematic 
parameters calculated from motion data collected via a 2D video-based 
pose-estimation (markerless motion capture) approach and a laboratory-based 3D 
motion capture approach during a floor-to-waist height functional lifting test. 
Method Twenty healthy participants each performed three floor-to-waist height 
lifts. Participants' lifts were captured simultaneously using 2D video 
(camcorder) in the sagittal plane and 3D motion capture (Vicon, Oxford, UK). The 
three lifts were representative of a perceived light, medium, and heavy load. 
Post-collection, video data were processed through a pose-estimation software 
(i.e., markerless motion capture). Motion data from 3D motion capture and 
video-based markerless motion capture were each used to calculate objective 
measures of interest relevant to a functional capacity evaluation (i.e., 
posture, balance, distance of the load from the body, and coordination). 
Bland-Altman analyses were used to calculate agreement between the two methods. 
Results Bland-Altman analysis revealed that mean differences ranged from 1.9° to 
22.1° for posture and coordination-based metrics calculated using markerless and 
3D motion capture, respectively. Limits of agreement for most posture and 
coordination measures were approximately + 20°. Conclusions 2D video-based pose 
estimation offers a strategy to objectively measure movement and subsequently 
calculated metrics of interest within an FCE context and setting, but at present 
the agreement between metrics calculated using 2D video-based methods and 3D 
motion capture is insufficient. Therefore, continued effort is required to 
improve the accuracy of 2D-video based pose estimation prior to inclusion into 
functional testing paradigms.

Role of emotional intelligence in effective nurse leadership.

Lambert S(1).

Author information:
(1)Faculty of Education and Children's Services, University of Chester, Chester, 
England.

Emotionally intelligent leaders demonstrate a sensitivity to their own and other 
people's psychological health and well-being, directing others towards common 
goals while developing effective personal relationships with their colleagues 
and team members. Emotional intelligence is particularly relevant in the context 
of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, where nurse leaders need to 
demonstrate this skill when supporting their teams to manage high levels of 
stress, exhaustion and the risk of moral injury. This article explores emotional 
intelligence, discusses its importance as a characteristic of effective nurse 
leaders and managers, and suggests practical activities that leaders can 
undertake to develop their emotional intelligence skills.

In recent times, COVID-19, has a great impact on the healthcare sector and 
results in a wide range of respiratory illnesses. It is a type of Ribonucleic 
acid (RNA) virus, which affects humans as well as animals. Though several 
artificial intelligence-based COVID-19 diagnosis models have been presented in 
the literature, most of the works have not focused on the hyperparameter tuning 
process. Therefore, this paper proposes an intelligent COVID-19 diagnosis model 
using a barnacle mating optimization (BMO) algorithm with a cascaded recurrent 
neural network (CRNN) model, named BMO-CRNN. The proposed BMO-CRNN model aims to 
detect and classify the existence of COVID-19 from Chest X-ray images. 
Initially, pre-processing is applied to enhance the quality of the image. Next, 
the CRNN model is used for feature extraction, followed by hyperparameter tuning 
of CRNN via the BMO algorithm to improve the classification performance. The BMO 
algorithm determines the optimal values of the CRNN hyperparameters namely 
learning rate, batch size, activation function, and epoch count. The application 
of CRNN and hyperparameter tuning using the BMO algorithm shows the novelty of 
this work. A comprehensive simulation analysis is carried out to ensure the 
better performance of the BMO-CRNN model, and the experimental outcome is 
investigated using several performance metrics. The simulation results portrayed 
that the BMO-CRNN model has showcased optimal performance with an average 
sensitivity of 97.01%, specificity of 98.15%, accuracy of 97.31%, and F-measure 
of 97.73% compared to state-of-the-art methods.

BACKGROUND: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a chronic mood disorder characterized by 
recurrent episodes of mania or hypomania and depression, expressed by changes in 
energy levels and behavior. However, most of relapse studies use evidence-based 
approaches with statistical methods. With the advance of the precision medicine 
this study aims to use machine learning (ML) approaches as a possible predictor 
in depressive relapses in BD.
METHOD: Four accepted and well used ML algorithms (Support Vector Machines, 
Random Forests, Naïve Bayes, and Multilayer Perceptron) were applied to the 
Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD) dataset 
in a cohort of 800 patients (507 patients presented depressive relapse and 293 
did not), who became euthymic during the study and were followed for one year.
RESULTS: The ML algorithms presented reasonable performance in the prediction 
task, ranging from 61 to 80% in the F-measure. The Random Forest algorithm 
obtained a higher average of performance (Relapse Group 68%; No Relapse Group 
74%). The three most important mood symptoms observed in the relapse visit 
(Random Forest) were: interest; depression mood and energy.
LIMITATIONS: Social and psychological parameters such as marital status, social 
support system, personality traits, might be an important predictor in 
depressive relapses, although we did not compute this data in our study.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that applying precision medicine models by 
means of machine learning in BD studies could be feasible as a sensible approach 
to better support medical decision-making in the BD treatment and prevention of 
future relapses.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Increased intrapancreatic fat is associated with pancreatic 
diseases; however, there are no established objective diagnostic criteria for 
fatty pancreas. On non-contrast computed tomography (CT), adipose tissue shows 
negative Hounsfield Unit (HU) attenuations (-150 to -30 HU). Using whole organ 
segmentation on non-contrast CT, we aimed to describe whole gland pancreatic 
attenuation and establish 5th and 10th percentile thresholds across a spectrum 
of age and sex. Subsequently, we aimed to evaluate the association between low 
pancreatic HU and risk of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).
METHODS: The whole pancreas was segmented in 19,456 images from 469 non-contrast 
CT scans. A convolutional neural network was trained to assist pancreas 
segmentation. Mean pancreatic HU, volume, and body composition metrics were 
calculated. The lower 5th and 10th percentile for mean pancreatic HU were 
identified, examining the association with age and sex. Pre-diagnostic CT scans 
from patients who later developed PDAC were compared to cancer-free controls.
RESULTS: Less than 5th percentile mean pancreatic HU was significantly 
associated with increase in BMI (OR 1.07; 1.03-1.11), visceral fat (OR 1.37; 
1.15-1.64), total abdominal fat (OR 1.12; 1.03-1.22), and diabetes mellitus type 
1 (OR 6.76; 1.68-27.28). Compared to controls, pre-diagnostic scans in PDAC 
cases had lower mean whole gland pancreatic HU (-0.2 vs 7.8, p = 0.026).
CONCLUSION: In this study, we report age and sex-specific distribution of 
pancreatic whole-gland CT attenuation. Compared to controls, mean whole gland 
pancreatic HU is significantly lower in the pre-diagnostic phase of PDAC.

Deep learning is one of the most promising machine learning techniques that 
revolutionalized the artificial intelligence field. The known traditional and 
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been utilized in medical pattern 
recognition applications that depend on deep learning concepts. This is 
attributed to the importance of anomaly detection (AD) in automatic diagnosis 
systems. In this paper, the AD is performed on medical electroencephalography 
(EEG) signal spectrograms and medical corneal images for Internet of medical 
things (IoMT) systems. Deep learning based on the CNN models is employed for 
this task with training and testing phases. Each input image passes through a 
series of convolution layers with different kernel filters. For the 
classification task, pooling and fully-connected layers are utilized. Computer 
simulation experiments reveal the success and superiority of the proposed models 
for automated medical diagnosis in IoMT systems.

BACKGROUND: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to compare 
deep learning versus ophthalmologists in glaucoma diagnosis on fundus 
examinations.
METHOD: PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov and ScienceDirect databases 
were searched for studies reporting a comparison between the glaucoma diagnosis 
performance of deep learning and ophthalmologists on fundus examinations on the 
same datasets, until 10 December 2020. Studies had to report an area under the 
receiver operating characteristics (AUC) with SD or enough data to generate one.
RESULTS: We included six studies in our meta-analysis. There was no difference 
in AUC between ophthalmologists (AUC = 82.0, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 
65.4-98.6) and deep learning (97.0, 89.4-104.5). There was also no difference 
using several pessimistic and optimistic variants of our meta-analysis: the best 
(82.2, 60.0-104.3) or worst (77.7, 53.1-102.3) ophthalmologists versus the best 
(97.1, 89.5-104.7) or worst (97.1, 88.5-105.6) deep learning of each study. We 
did not retrieve any factors influencing those results.
CONCLUSION: Deep learning had similar performance compared to ophthalmologists 
in glaucoma diagnosis from fundus examinations. Further studies should evaluate 
deep learning in clinical situations.

BACKGROUND: The benefits of treatment for many conditions are time dependent. 
The burden of these emergency care sensitive conditions (ECSCs) is especially 
high in low- and middle-income countries. Our objective was to analyze 
geospatial trends in ECSCs and characterize regional disparities in access to 
emergency care in Brazil.
METHODS: From publicly available datasets, we extracted data on patients 
assigned an ECSC-related ICD-10 code and on the country's emergency facilities 
from 2015-2019. Using ArcGIS, OpenStreetMap, and WorldPop, we created catchment 
areas corresponding to 180 minutes of driving distance from each hospital. We 
then used ArcGIS to characterize space-time trends in ECSC admissions and to 
complete an Origin-Destination analysis to determine the path from household to 
closest hospital.
FINDINGS: There were 1362 municipalities flagged as "hot spots," areas with a 
high volume of ECSCs. Of those, 69.7% were more than 180 minutes (171 km) from 
the closest emergency facility. These municipalities were primarily located in 
the states of Minas Gerais, Bahia, Espiríto Santo, Tocantins, and Amapá. In the 
North region, only 69.1% of the population resided within 180 minutes of an 
emergency hospital.
INTERPRETATIONS: Significant geographical barriers to accessing emergency care 
exist in certain areas of Brazil, especially in peri-urban areas and the North 
region. One limitation of this approach is that geolocation was not possible in 
some areas and thus we are likely underestimating the burden of inadequate 
access. Subsequent work should evaluate ECSC mortality data.

Choquet Integral and Coalition Game-Based Ensemble of Deep Learning Models for 
COVID-19 Screening From Chest X-Ray Images.

Bhowal P, Sen S, Yoon JH, Geem ZW, Sarkar R.

Under the present circumstances, when we are still under the threat of different 
strains of coronavirus, and since the most widely used method for COVID-19 
detection, RT-PCR is a tedious and time-consuming manual procedure with poor 
precision, the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Computer-Aided 
Diagnosis (CAD) is inevitable. Though, some vaccines have now been authorized 
worldwide, it will take huge time to reach everyone, especially in developing 
countries. In this work, we have analyzed Chest X-ray (CXR) images for the 
detection of the coronavirus. The primary agenda of this proposed research study 
is to leverage the classification performance of the deep learning models using 
ensemble learning. Many papers have proposed different ensemble learning 
techniques in this field, some methods using aggregation functions like Weighted 
Arithmetic Mean (WAM) among others. However, none of these methods take into 
consideration the decisions that subsets of the classifiers take. In this paper, 
we have applied Choquet integral for ensemble and propose a novel method for the 
evaluation of fuzzy measures using coalition game theory, information theory, 
and Lambda fuzzy approximation. Three different sets of fuzzy measures are 
calculated using three different weighting schemes along with information theory 
and coalition game theory. Using these three sets of fuzzy measures, three 
Choquet integrals are calculated and their decisions are finally combined. 
Besides, we have created a database by combining several image repositories 
developed recently. Impressive results on the newly developed dataset and the 
challenging COVIDx dataset support the efficacy and robustness of the proposed 
method. Our experimental results outperform many recently proposed methods.

Combining Automated Organoid Workflows with Artificial Intelligence-Based 
Analyses: Opportunities to Build a New Generation of Interdisciplinary 
High-Throughput Screens for Parkinson's Disease and Beyond.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease and 
primarily characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia 
nigra pars compacta of the midbrain. Despite decades of research and the 
development of various disease model systems, there is no curative treatment. 
This could be due to current model systems, including cell culture and animal 
models, not adequately recapitulating human PD etiology. More complex human 
disease models, including human midbrain organoids, are maturing technologies 
that increasingly enable the strategic incorporation of the missing components 
needed to model PD in vitro. The resulting organoid-based biological complexity 
provides new opportunities and challenges in data analysis of rich multimodal 
data sets. Emerging artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities can take advantage 
of large, broad data sets and even correlate results across disciplines. Current 
organoid technologies no longer lack the prerequisites for large-scale 
high-throughput screening (HTS) and can generate complex yet reproducible data 
suitable for AI-based data mining. We have recently developed a fully scalable 
and HTS-compatible workflow for the generation, maintenance, and analysis of 
three-dimensional (3D) microtissues mimicking key characteristics of the human 
midbrain (called "automated midbrain organoids," AMOs). AMOs build a 
reproducible, scalable foundation for creating next-generation 3D models of 
human neural disease that can fuel mechanism-agnostic phenotypic drug discovery 
in human in vitro PD models and beyond. Here, we explore the opportunities and 
challenges resulting from the convergence of organoid HTS and AI-driven data 
analytics and outline potential future avenues toward the discovery of novel 
mechanisms and drugs in PD research. © 2021 The Authors. Movement Disorders

Recent epidemiological data report that worldwide more than 53 million people 
have been infected by SARS-CoV-2, resulting in 1.3 million deaths. The disease 
has been spreading very rapidly and few months after the identification of the 
first infected, shortage of hospital resources quickly became a problem. In this 
work we investigate whether artificial intelligence working with chest X-ray 
(CXR) scans and clinical data can be used as a possible tool for the early 
identification of patients at risk of severe outcome, like intensive care or 
death. Indeed, further to induce lower radiation dose than computed tomography 
(CT), CXR is a simpler and faster radiological technique, being also more 
widespread. In this respect, we present three approaches that use features 
extracted from CXR images, either handcrafted or automatically learnt by 
convolutional neuronal networks, which are then integrated with the clinical 
data. As a further contribution, this work introduces a repository that collects 
data from 820 patients enrolled in six Italian hospitals in spring 2020 during 
the first COVID-19 emergency. The dataset includes CXR images, several clinical 
attributes and clinical outcomes. Exhaustive evaluation shows promising 
performance both in 10-fold and leave-one-centre-out cross-validation, 
suggesting that clinical data and images have the potential to provide useful 
information for the management of patients and hospital resources.

BACKGROUND: Bias-prone psychiatric interviews remain the mainstay of bipolar 
disorder (BD) assessment. The development of digital phenotyping promises to 
improve BD management. We present a systematic review of the evidence about the 
use of portable digital devices for the identification of BD, BD types and BD 
mood states and for symptom assessment.
METHODS: We searched Web of KnowledgeSM, Scopus ®, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital 
Library databases (until 5/1/2021) for articles evaluating the use of 
portable/wearable digital devices, such as smartphone apps, wearable sensors, 
audio and/or visual recordings, and multimodal tools. The protocol is registered 
in PROSPERO (CRD42020200086).
RESULTS: We included 62 studies (2325 BD; 724 healthy controls, HC): 27 using 
smartphone apps, either for recording self-assessments (n = 10) or for passively 
gathering metadata (n = 7) or both (n = 10); 15 using wearable sensors for 
physiological parameters; 17 analysing audio and/or video recordings; 3 using 
multiple technologies. Two thirds of the included studies applied artificial 
intelligence (AI)-based approaches. They achieved fair to excellent 
classification performances.
LIMITATIONS: The included studies had small sample sizes and marked 
heterogeneity. Evidence of overfitting emerged, limiting generalizability. The 
absence of clear guidelines about reporting classification performances, with no 
shared standard metrics, makes results hardly interpretable and comparable.
CONCLUSIONS: New technologies offer a noteworthy opportunity to BD digital 
phenotyping with objectivity and high granularity. AI-based models could deliver 
important support in clinical decision-making. Further research and cooperation 
between different stakeholders are needed for addressing methodological, ethical 
and socio-economic considerations.

The incorporation of patients' perspectives into drug discovery and development 
has become critically important from the viewpoint of accounting for modern-day 
business dynamics. There is a trend among patients to narrate their disease 
experiences on social media. The insights gained by analyzing the data 
pertaining to such social-media posts could be leveraged to support 
patient-centered drug development. Manual analysis of these data is nearly 
impossible, but artificial intelligence enables automated and cost-effective 
processing, also referred as social media mining (SMM). This paper discusses the 
fundamental SMM methods along with several relevant drug-development use cases.

Transforming neural activities into language is revolutionary for human-computer 
interaction as well as functional restoration of aphasia. Present rapid 
development of artificial intelligence makes it feasible to decode the neural 
signals of human visual activities. In this paper, a novel Progressive Transfer 
Language Decoding Model (PT-LDM) is proposed to decode visual fMRI signals into 
phrases or sentences when natural images are being watched. The PT-LDM consists 
of an image-encoder, a fMRI encoder and a language-decoder. The results showed 
that phrases and sentences were successfully generated from visual activities. 
Similarity analysis showed that three often-used evaluation indexes BLEU, ROUGE 
and CIDEr reached 0.182, 0.197 and 0.680 averagely between the generated texts 
and the corresponding annotated texts in the testing set respectively, 
significantly higher than the baseline. Moreover, we found that higher visual 
areas usually had better performance than lower visual areas and the 
contribution curve of visual response patterns in language decoding varied at 
successively different time points. Our findings demonstrate that the neural 
representations elicited in visual cortices when scenes are being viewed have 
already contained semantic information that can be utilized to generate human 
language. Our study shows potential application of language-based brain-machine 
interfaces in the future, especially for assisting aphasics in communicating 
more efficiently with fMRI signals.

INTRODUCTION: Understanding the neurodevelopmental effects of manganese (Mn) is 
complicated due to its essentiality for growth and development. While evidence 
exists for the harmful effects of excess Mn, pediatric epidemiologic studies 
have observed inconsistent associations between Mn and child cognition.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to estimate prospective associations between Mn measured in 
three different early-life time windows with adolescent cognition using 
deciduous teeth biomarkers.
METHODS: Deciduous teeth were collected from 195 participants (ages 10-14 years) 
of the Public Health Impact of Manganese Exposure (PHIME) study in Brescia, 
Italy. Measurements of tooth Mn represented prenatal (∼14 weeks gestation - 
birth), early postnatal (birth - 1.5 years) and childhood (∼1.5 - 6 years) time 
windows. Neuropsychologists administered the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for 
Children, 3rd edition (WISC-III), to obtain composite IQ and subtest scores. 
Associations between tooth Mn at each time window and adolescent WISC-III scores 
were estimated using multivariable linear regression. We tested differences in 
associations between Mn and outcomes across time windows using multiple 
informant models. Sex-specific associations were explored in stratified models.
RESULTS: Adjusted associations between tooth Mn and composite IQ scores were 
positive in the prenatal period and negative in the childhood period. 
Associations were strongest for subtest scores that reflect working memory, 
problem solving, visuospatial ability and attention: prenatal Mn was positively 
associated with Digits backward [SD change in score per interquartile range 
increase in Mn: β = 0.20 (95 % CI: 0.02, 0.38)] and Block design [β = 0.21 
(0.01, 0.41)] and early postnatal Mn was positively associated with Digits 
forward [β = 0.24 (0.09, 0.40)], while childhood Mn was negatively associated 
with Coding [β = -0.14 (-0.28, -0.001)]. Sex-stratified analyses suggested 
different Mn-cognition associations for boys and girls and was also dependent on 
the time window of exposure.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that exposure timing is critical when evaluating 
Mn associations between Mn and cognition. Higher prenatal Mn was beneficial for 
adolescent cognition; however, these beneficial associations shifted towards 
harmful effects in later time windows. Cognitive domains most sensitive to Mn 
across time windows included visuospatial ability, working memory, attention and 
problem-solving.

Accurate prediction of any type of natural hazard is a challenging task. Of all 
the various hazards, drought prediction is challenging as it lacks a universal 
definition and is getting adverse with climate change impacting drought events 
both spatially and temporally. The problem becomes more complex as drought 
occurrence is dependent on a multitude of factors ranging from 
hydro-meteorological to climatic variables. A paradigm shift happened in this 
field when it was found that the inclusion of climatic variables in the 
data-driven prediction model improves the accuracy. However, this understanding 
has been primarily using statistical metrics used to measure the model accuracy. 
The present work tries to explore this finding using an explainable artificial 
intelligence (XAI) model. The explainable deep learning model development and 
comparative analysis were performed using known understandings drawn from 
physical-based models. The work also tries to explore how the model achieves 
specific results at different spatio-temporal intervals, enabling us to 
understand the local interactions among the predictors for different drought 
conditions and drought periods. The drought index used in the study is Standard 
Precipitation Index (SPI) at 12 month scales applied for five different regions 
in New South Wales, Australia, with the explainable algorithm being SHapley 
Additive exPlanations (SHAP). The conclusions drawn from SHAP plots depict the 
importance of climatic variables at a monthly scale and varying ranges of annual 
scale. We observe that the results obtained from SHAP align with the physical 
model interpretations, thus suggesting the need to add climatic variables as 
predictors in the prediction model.

Nowadays, releasing the Emerging Pollutants (EPs) in the nature is one of the 
main reasons for many health and environmental disasters. Amoxicillin as an 
antibiotic is one of the EPs and categorized as the Endocrine Disrupting 
Compounds (EDCs) in hazardous materials. Accumulation of amoxicillin in the soil 
bulk increases the cancer risk, drug resistances and other epidemiological 
diseases. Hence, the soil bioremediation of antibiotics can be a solution for 
this problem which is more environmental-friendly system. This study technically 
creates a bio-engine setup in soil bulk for remediation of amoxicillin based on 
Aspergillus Flavus (AF) activities and Removal Percentage (RP) of amoxicillin 
with Aflatoxin B1 Generation (AG) controls. The main novelty is to propose a 
hybrid computational intelligence approach to do optimization for mechanical and 
biological aspects and to predict the behavior of bio-engine's effective 
mechanical and biological features in an intelligent way. The optimization model 
is formulated by the Central Composite Design (CCD) which is set by the Response 
Surface Methodology (RSM). The prediction model is formulated by the Random 
Forest (RF), Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and Random Tree (RT) 
algorithms. According to the experimental practices from real soil samples in 
different times and places, concentration of amoxicillin and Aflatoxin B1 are 
set equal to 25 mg/L (ppm) and 15 μg/L (ppb). Likewise, the outcomes of 
experiments in CCD-RSM computations are evaluated by curve fitting comparisons 
between linear, 2FI, quadratic and cubic polynomial equations with considering 
to regression coefficient and predicted regression coefficient values, ANOVA and 
optimization by sequential differentiation. Based on the results of CCD-RSM, the 
RP performance in the optimum conditions is measured around 86% and in 25 days 
after runtime, the RP and AG are balanced in the safe mode. The proposed hybrid 
model achieves the 0.99 accuracy. The applicability of the research is done 
using real field evaluations from drug industrial park in Mashhad city in Iran. 
Finally, a broad analysis is done and managerial insights are concluded. The 
main findings of the present research are: (I) with application of 
bioremediation from fungus activities, amoxicillin amounts can be control in 
soil resources with minimum AG, (II) ANFIS model has the best accuracy for smart 
monitoring of amoxicillin bioremediation in soil environments and (III) based on 
the statistical assessments Aeration Intensity and AF/Biological Waste ratio are 
most effective on the amoxicillin removal percentage.

BACKGROUND: Falls are the most common cause of injury-related death for patients 
older than 45.  We hypothesized that a machine learning algorithm developed from 
state-level registry data could make accurate outcome predictions at a level 1 
trauma hospital.
METHODS: Data for all patients admitted for fall injury during 2009 - 2019 in 
the state of Pennsylvania were derived from the state trauma registry.  Thirteen 
variables that were immediately available upon patient arrival were used for 
prediction modeling.  Data for the test institution were withheld from model 
creation.  Algorithms assessed included logistic regression (LR), random forest 
(RF), and extreme gradient boost (XGB).  Model discrimination for mortality was 
assessed with area under the curve (AUC) for each algorithm at our level 1 
trauma center.
RESULTS: 180,284 patients met inclusion criteria.  The mean age was 69 years ± 
18.5 years with a mortality rate of 4.0%.  The AUC for predicting mortality in 
patients that fall for LR, RF, and XGB were 0.797, 0.876, and 0.880, 
respectively.  The variables which contributed to the prediction in descending 
order of importance for XGB were respiratory rate, pulse, systolic blood 
pressure, ethnicity, weight, sex, age, temperature, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) 
eye, race, GCS voice, GCS motor, and blood alcohol level.
CONCLUSIONS: An extreme gradient boost model developed using state-wide trauma 
data can accurately predict mortality after fall at a single center within the 
state.  This machine learning model can be implemented by local trauma systems 
within the state of Pennsylvania to identify patients injured by fall that 
require greater attention, transfer to a higher level of care, and higher 
resource allocation.

WI, USA.

Our goal was to examine the relationship between biological and sociocultural 
factors that predict utilitarian moral judgment. Utilitarian moral judgments 
occur when a specific action is based on the outcome rather than its consistency 
with social norms. We predicted that (1) individuals with higher levels of 
dopamine will make more utilitarian decisions and (2) individuals who express 
greater religiosity will make less utilitarian judgments. We measured dopamine 
using spontaneous eyeblink rate, an indirect measure associated with striatal 
dopaminergic transmission. A total of 96 participants completed a utilitarian 
moral judgment task where they made judgments regarding nonmoral, impersonal, 
personal low-conflict, and personal high-conflict moral dilemmas. Then, 
participants completed a questionnaire measuring religiosity. We found a 
negative relationship between religiosity and the proportion of "yes" judgments 
participants made in the high-conflict personal dilemmas, which was consistent 
with our second hypothesis. None of our other hypotheses were supported. 
Understanding biological and cultural factors that relate to utilitarian moral 
judgment may also help in developing artificial intelligence that more closely 
mimic human behavior.

BACKGROUND: Fascial dehiscence following exploratory laparotomy is associated 
with significant morbidity and increased mortality. Previously published risk 
prediction models for fascial dehiscence are dated and limit a surgeon's ability 
to perform reliable risk assessment intraoperatively. We sought to determine if 
machine learning can predict fascial dehiscence after exploratory laparotomy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted of 93,024 
patients undergoing exploratory laparotomy from the 2011-2018 ACS NSQIP data 
files. Data were divided into training (2011-2016, n = 69,969) and temporal 
validation (2017-2018, n = 23,055) cohorts. A clinical decision support tool was 
developed using the model generated via machine learning techniques.
RESULTS: 1,332 (1.9%) patients in the training cohort and 390 (1.7%) patients in 
the temporal validation cohort developed fascial dehiscence. The area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.69 (95% CI 0.66 to 0.72) in the 
validation cohort. Model predictions demonstrated excellent probability 
calibration. Decision curve analysis calculates net clinical benefit within a 
threshold range of 0.8%-4.5%. Operative time, surgical site and deep space 
infections, and body mass index were among the most important features for model 
predictions. Finally, operative time, sodium level, and hematocrit demonstrated 
non-linear relationships with predicted risk.
CONCLUSION: A clinical decision support tool for predicting fascial dehiscence 
after exploratory laparotomy was created and validated on a contemporary, 
national patient cohort using machine learning. The tool calculates net clinical 
benefit and can be used at the point of care. Some identified risk factor 
relationships were found to be complex and non-linear, highlighting the ability 
of some machine learning applications to capture nuanced, patient-specific risk 
profiles.

Continual learning is considered a promising step toward next-generation 
Artificial Intelligence (AI), where deep neural networks (DNNs) make decisions 
by continuously learning a sequence of different tasks akin to human learning 
processes. It is still quite primitive, with existing works focusing primarily 
on avoiding (catastrophic) forgetting. However, since forgetting is inevitable 
given bounded memory and unbounded task loads, 'how to reasonably forget' is a 
problem continual learning must address in order to reduce the performance gap 
between AIs and humans, in terms of (1) memory efficiency, (2) generalizability, 
and (3) robustness when dealing with noisy data. To address this, we propose a 
novel ScheMAtic memory peRsistence and Transience (SMART)1 framework for 
continual learning with external memory that builds on recent advances in 
neuroscience. The efficiency and generalizability are enhanced by a novel 
long-term forgetting mechanism and schematic memory, using sparsity and 
'backward positive transfer' constraints with theoretical guarantees on the 
error bound. Robust enhancement is achieved using a novel short-term forgetting 
mechanism inspired by background information-gated learning. Finally, an 
extensive experimental analysis on both benchmark and real-world datasets 
demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of our model.

BACKGROUND: Given the pressure on modern healthcare systems, eHealth can offer 
valuable opportunities. However, understanding the potential and challenges of 
eHealth in daily practice can be challenging for many general practitioners 
(GPs) and their staff.
OBJECTIVES: To critically appraise five widely used eHealth applications, in 
relation to safe, evidence-based and high-quality eHealth. Using these 
applications as examples, we aim to increase understanding of eHealth among GPs 
and highlight the opportunities and challenges presented by eHealth.
DISCUSSION: eHealth applications can support patients while increasing 
efficiency for GPs. A three-way division (inform, monitor, track; interaction; 
data utilisation) characterises many eHealth applications, with an increasing 
degree of complexity depending on the domain. All applications provide 
information and some have extra functionalities that promote interaction, while 
data analysis and artificial intelligence may be applied to support or (fully) 
automate care processes. Applications in the inform domain are relatively easy 
to use and implement but their impact on clinical outcomes may be limited. More 
demanding applications, in terms of privacy and ethical aspects, are found in 
the data utilisation domain and may potentially have a more significant impact 
on care processes and patient outcomes. When selecting and implementing eHealth 
applications, we recommend that GPs remain critical regarding preconditions on 
safe, evidence-based and high-quality eHealth, particularly in the case of more 
complex applications in the data utilisation domain.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is the most accurate diagnostic 
modality for polypoid lesions of the gallbladder (GB), but is limited by 
subjective interpretation. Deep learning-based artificial intelligence (AI) 
algorithms are under development. We evaluated the diagnostic performance of AI 
in differentiating polypoid lesions using EUS images.
METHODS: The diagnostic performance of the EUS-AI system with ResNet50 
architecture was evaluated via three processes: training, internal validation, 
and testing using an AI development cohort of 1039 EUS images (836 GB polyps and 
203 gallstones). The diagnostic performance was verified using an external 
validation cohort of 83 patients and compared with the performance of EUS 
endoscopists.
RESULTS: In the AI development cohort, we developed an EUS-AI algorithm and 
evaluated the diagnostic performance of the EUS-AI including sensitivity, 
specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy. 
For the differential diagnosis of neoplastic and non-neoplastic GB polyps, these 
values for EUS-AI were 57.9%, 96.5%, 77.8%, 91.6%, and 89.8%, respectively. In 
the external validation cohort, we compared diagnostic performances between 
EUS-AI and endoscopists. For the differential diagnosis of neoplastic and 
non-neoplastic GB polyps, the sensitivity and specificity were 33.3% and 96.1% 
for EUS-AI; they were 74.2% and 44.9%, respectively, for the endoscopists. 
Besides, the accuracy of the EUS-AI was between the accuracies of mid-level 
(66.7%) and expert EUS endoscopists (77.5%).
CONCLUSIONS: This newly developed EUS-AI system showed favorable performance for 
the diagnosis of neoplastic GB polyps, with a performance comparable to that of 
EUS endoscopists.

A focused cardiac ultrasound performed by an emergency physician is becoming 
part of the standard assessment of patients in a variety of clinical situations. 
The development of inexpensive, portable handheld devices promises to make 
point-of-care ultrasound even more accessible over the coming decades. Many of 
these handheld devices are beginning to integrate artificial intelligence (AI) 
for image analysis. The integration of AI into focused cardiac ultrasound will 
have a number of implications for emergency physicians. This perspective 
presents an overview of the current state of AI research in echocardiography 
relevant to the emergency physician, as well as the future possibilities, 
challenges and risks of this technology.

In children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), joint attention is regarded as 
a predictor of language function, social skills, communication, adaptive 
function, and intelligence. However, existing information about the association 
between joint attention and intelligence is limited. Most such studies have 
examined children with low intelligence. For this study, we investigated whether 
joint attention is related to intelligence in young children with autism 
spectrum disorder (ASD) without severe intellectual disability. We analyzed 113 
children with ASD aged 40-98 months. Their Kaufman Assessment Battery (K-ABC) 
Mental Processing Index (MPI) scores are 60 and more (mean 93.4). We evaluated 
their intelligence using K-ABC and evaluated their joint attention using ADOS-2. 
After we performed simple regression analyses using K-ABC MPI and its nine 
subscales as dependent variables, using joint attention as the independent 
variable, we identified joint attention as a positive predictor of the MPI and 
its two subscales. From this result, we conclude that joint attention is related 
to intelligence in young children with ASD without severe intellectual 
disability. This result suggests a beneficial effect of early intervention 
targeting joint attention for children with ASD. LAY SUMMARY: Joint attention is 
the ability to coordinate visual attention with another person and then shift 
one's gaze toward an object or event. Impairment of joint attention is regarded 
as an early marker of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This study revealed 
impairment of joint attention as associated with lower intelligence in ASD 
children. These results are expected to constitute a rationale for future 
studies, particularly addressing beneficial effects of early intervention 
targeting joint attention for children with ASD.

The process of removal of heavy metals is important due to their toxic effects 
on living organisms and undesirable anthropogenic effects. Conventional methods 
possess many irreconcilable disadvantages pertaining to cost and efficiency. As 
a result, the usage of biochar, which is produced as a by-product of biomass 
pyrolysis, has gained sizable traction in recent times for the removal of heavy 
metals. This review elucidates some widely recognized harmful heavy metals and 
their removal using biochar. It also highlights and compares the variety of 
feedstock available for preparation of biochar, pyrolysis variables involved and 
efficiency of biochar. Various adsorption kinetics and isotherms are also 
discussed along with the process of desorption to recycle biochar for reuse as 
adsorbent. Furthermore, this review elucidates the advancements in remediation 
of heavy metals using biochar by emphasizing the importance and advantages in 
the usage of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) for the 
optimization of adsorption variables and biochar feedstock properties. The usage 
of AI and ML is cost and time-effective and allows an interdisciplinary approach 
to remove heavy metals by biochar.

INTRODUCTION: Automatic assessment of speech impairment is a cutting edge topic 
in Parkinson's disease (PD). Language disorders are known to occur several years 
earlier than typical motor symptoms, thus speech analysis may contribute to the 
early diagnosis of the disease. Moreover, the remote monitoring of dysphonia 
could allow achieving an effective follow-up of PD clinical condition, possibly 
performed in the home environment.
METHODS: In this work, we performed a multi-level analysis, progressively 
combining features extracted from the entire signal, the voiced segments, and 
the on-set/off-set regions, leading to a total number of 126 features. 
Furthermore, we compared the performance of early and late feature fusion 
schemes, aiming to identify the best model configuration and taking advantage of 
having 25 isolated words pronounced by each subject. We employed data from the 
PC-GITA database (50 healthy controls and 50 PD patients) for validation and 
testing.
RESULTS: We implemented an optimized k-Nearest Neighbours model for the binary 
classification of PD patients versus healthy controls. We achieved an accuracy 
of 99.4% in 10-fold cross-validation and 94.3% in testing on the PC-GITA 
database (average value of male and female subjects).
CONCLUSION: The promising performance yielded by our model confirms the 
feasibility of automatic assessment of PD using voice recordings. Moreover, a 
post-hoc analysis of the most relevant features discloses the option of voice 
processing using a simple smartphone application.

As a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the European Society of Cardiology 
(ESC) was forced to pivot the scientific programme of the ESC Congress 2021 into 
a totally new format for online consumption, The Digital Experience. A variety 
of new suppliers were involved, including experts in TV studio, cloud 
infrastructure, online platforms, video management, and online analytics. An 
information technology platform able to support hundreds of thousands 
simultaneous connections was built and cloud computing technologies were put in 
place to help scale up and down the resources needed for the high number of 
users at peak times. The video management system was characterized by multiple 
layers of security and redundancy and offered the same fluidity, albeit at a 
different resolution, to all user independently of the performance of their 
internet connection. The event, free for all users, was an undisputed success, 
both from a scientific/educational as well as from a digital technology 
perspective. The number of registrations increased by almost four-fold when 
compared with the 2019 record-breaking edition in Paris, with a greater 
proportion of younger and female participants as well as of participants from 
low- and middle-income countries. No major technical failures were encountered. 
For the first time in history, attendees from all around the globe had the same 
real-time access to the world's most popular cardiovascular conference.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare how often fine-needle 
aspiration (FNA) would be recommended for nodules in unselected, low-risk adult 
patients referred for sonographic evaluation of thyroid nodules by ACR Thyroid 
Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS), the American Thyroid Association 
guidelines (ATA), Korean Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (K-TIRADS), 
European Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (EU-TIRADS), and Artificial 
Intelligence Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (AI-TIRADS).
METHODS: Seven practices prospectively submitted thyroid ultrasound reports on 
adult patients to the ACR Thyroid Imaging Research Registry between October 2018 
and March 2020. Data were collected about the sonographic features of each 
nodule using a structured reporting template with fields for the five ACR 
TI-RADS ultrasound categories plus maximum nodule size. The nodules were also 
retrospectively categorized according to criteria from ACR TI-RADS, the ATA, 
K-TIRADS, EU-TIRADS, and AI-TIRADS to compare FNA recommendation rates.
RESULTS: For 27,933 nodules in 12,208 patients, ACR TI-RADS recommended FNA for 
8,128 nodules (29.1%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.286-0.296). The ATA 
guidelines, EU-TIRADS, K-TIRADS, and AI-TIRADS would have recommended FNA for 
16,385 (58.7%, 95% CI 0.581-0.592), 10,854 (38.9%, 95% CI 0.383-0.394), 15,917 
(57.0%, 95% CI 0.564-0.576), and 7,342 (26.3%, 95% CI 0.258-0.268) nodules, 
respectively. Recommendation for FNA on TR3 and TR4 nodules was lowest for ACR 
TI-RADS at 18% and 30%, respectively. ACR TI-RADS categorized more nodules as 
TR2, which does not require FNA. At the high suspicion level, the FNA rate was 
similar for all guidelines at 68.7% to 75.5%.
CONCLUSION: ACR TI-RADS recommends 25% to 50% fewer biopsies compared with ATA, 
EU-TIRADS, and K-TIRADS because of differences in size thresholds and criteria 
for risk levels.

BACKGROUND: Visual evaluation is the most common method of evaluating burn 
wounds. Its subjective nature can lead to inaccurate diagnoses and inappropriate 
burn center referrals. Machine learning may provide an objective solution. The 
objective of this study is to summarize the literature on ML in burn wound 
evaluation.
METHODS: A systematic review of articles published between January 2000 and 
January 2021 was performed using PubMed and MEDLINE (OVID). Articles reporting 
on ML or automation to evaluate burn wounds were included. Keywords included 
burns, machine/deep learning, artificial intelligence, burn classification 
technology, and mobile applications. Data were extracted on study design, method 
of data acquisition, machine learning techniques, and machine learning accuracy.
RESULTS: Thirty articles were included. Nine studies used machine learning and 
automation to estimate percent total body surface area (%TBSA) burned, 4 
calculated fluid estimations, 19 estimated burn depth, 5 estimated need for 
surgery, and 2 evaluated scarring. Models calculating %TBSA burned demonstrated 
accuracies comparable to or better than paper methods. Burn depth classification 
models achieved accuracies of >83%.
CONCLUSION: Machine learning provides an objective adjunct that may improve 
diagnostic accuracy in evaluating burn wound severity. Existing models remain in 
the early stages with future studies needed to assess their clinical 
feasibility.

Our daily human life is filled with a myriad of joint action moments, be it 
children playing, adults working together (i.e., team sports), or strangers 
navigating through a crowd. Joint action brings individuals (and embodiment of 
their emotions) together, in space and in time. Yet little is known about how 
individual emotions propagate through embodied presence in a group, and how 
joint action changes individual emotion. In fact, the multi-agent component is 
largely missing from neuroscience-based approaches to emotion, and reversely 
joint action research has not found a way yet to include emotion as one of the 
key parameters to model socio-motor interaction. In this review, we first 
identify the gap and then stockpile evidence showing strong entanglement between 
emotion and acting together from various branches of sciences. We propose an 
integrative approach to bridge the gap, highlight five research avenues to do so 
in behavioral neuroscience and digital sciences, and address some of the key 
challenges in the area faced by modern societies.

Cancer is becoming one of the deadliest disease in both developed as well as 
developing countries and continuous effort is being made to find innovative 
therapies for myriad types of cancers that afflict the human body. Therapeutic 
options for cancer have grown exponentially over the time but we are quite a way 
off from finding a magic bullet that can help cure cancer and based on the 
current evidence we may never find a catch all cure ever and it becomes crucial 
that we keep on innovating and find multiple ways to attack the menace of this 
dreaded disease. Many patients suffer recurrence of disease and require 
second-line or in some cases more than two lines of treatment. In this review 
article we have discussed the available therapies along with the newer 
advancements that have been made in cancer therapy. Latest developments in 
treatment of various cancers that have been discussed include gene editing using 
CRISPR/Cas9, theranostics, viral mediated therapy, artificial intelligence, 
tumor infiltrating lymphocyte therapy, etc.

BACKGROUND: While individuals living in long-term care (LTC) homes have 
experienced adverse outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection, few studies have examined 
a broad range of predictors of 30-day mortality in this population.
METHODS: We studied residents living in LTC homes in Ontario, Canada, who 
underwent PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection from January 1 to August 31, 
2020, and examined predictors of all-cause death within 30 days after a positive 
test for SARS-CoV-2. We examined a broad range of risk factor categories 
including demographics, comorbidities, functional status, laboratory tests, and 
characteristics of the LTC facility and surrounding community were examined. In 
total, 304 potential predictors were evaluated for their association with 
mortality using machine learning (Random Forest).
RESULTS: A total of 64,733 residents of LTC, median age 86 (78, 91) years (31.8% 
men), underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing, of whom 5029 (7.8%) tested positive. 
Thirty-day mortality rates were 28.7% (1442 deaths) after a positive test. Of 
59,702 residents who tested negative, 2652 (4.4%) died within 30 days of 
testing. Predictors of mortality after SARS-CoV-2 infection included age, 
functional status (e.g., activity of daily living score and pressure ulcer 
risk), male sex, undernutrition, dehydration risk, prior hospital contacts for 
respiratory illness, and duration of comorbidities (e.g., heart failure, COPD). 
Lower GFR, hemoglobin concentration, lymphocyte count, and serum albumin were 
associated with higher mortality. After combining all covariates to generate a 
risk index, mortality rate in the highest risk quartile was 48.3% compared with 
7% in the first quartile (odds ratio 12.42, 95%CI: 6.67, 22.80, p < 0.001). 
Deaths continued to increase rapidly for 15 days after the positive test.
CONCLUSIONS: LTC residents, particularly those with reduced functional status, 
comorbidities, and abnormalities on routine laboratory tests, are at high risk 
for mortality after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recognizing high-risk residents in LTC 
may enhance institution of appropriate preventative measures.

OBJECTIVE: To predict the hand-wrist maturation stages based on the cervical 
vertebrae (CV) images, and to analyse the accuracy of the proposed algorithms.
SETTINGS AND POPULATION: A total of 499 pairs of hand-wrist radiographs and 
lateral cephalograms of 455 orthodontic patients aged 6-18 years were used for 
developing the prediction model for hand-wrist skeletal maturation stages.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The hand-wrist radiographs and the lateral cephalograms 
were collected from two university hospitals and a paediatric dental clinic. 
After identifying the 13 anatomic landmarks of the CV, the width-height ratio, 
width-perpendicular height ratio and concavity ratio of the CV were used as the 
morphometric features of the CV. Patients' chronological age and sex were also 
included as input data. The ground truth data were the Fishman SMI based on the 
hand-wrist radiographs. Three specialists determined the ground truth SMI. An 
ensemble machine learning methods were used to predict the Fishman SMI. 
Five-fold cross-validation was performed. The mean absolute error (MAE), round 
MAE and root mean square error (RMSE) values were used to assess the performance 
of the final ensemble model.
RESULTS: The final ensemble model consisted of eight machine learning models. 
The MAE, round MAE and RMSE were 0.90, 0.87 and 1.20, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Prediction of hand-wrist SMI based on CV images is possible using 
machine learning methods. Chronological age and sex increased the prediction 
accuracy. An automated diagnosis of the skeletal maturation may aid as a 
decision-supporting tool for evaluating the optimal treatment timing for growing 
patients.

During the current global public health emergency caused by novel coronavirus 
disease 19 (COVID-19), researchers and medical experts started working day and 
night to search for new technologies to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. Recent 
studies have shown that artificial intelligence (AI) has been successfully 
employed in the health sector for various healthcare procedures. This study 
comprehensively reviewed the research and development on state-of-the-art 
applications of artificial intelligence for combating the COVID-19 pandemic. In 
the process of literature retrieval, the relevant literature from citation 
databases including ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, and Preprints from arXiv, 
medRxiv, and bioRxiv was selected. Recent advances in the field of AI-based 
technologies are critically reviewed and summarized. Various challenges 
associated with the use of these technologies are highlighted and based on 
updated studies and critical analysis, research gaps and future recommendations 
are identified and discussed. The comparison between various machine learning 
(ML) and deep learning (DL) methods, the dominant AI-based technique, mostly 
used ML and DL methods for COVID-19 detection, diagnosis, screening, 
classification, drug repurposing, prediction, and forecasting, and insights 
about where the current research is heading are highlighted. Recent research and 
development in the field of artificial intelligence has greatly improved the 
COVID-19 screening, diagnostics, and prediction and results in better scale-up, 
timely response, most reliable, and efficient outcomes, and sometimes 
outperforms humans in certain healthcare tasks. This review article will help 
researchers, healthcare institutes and organizations, government officials, and 
policymakers with new insights into how AI can control the COVID-19 pandemic and 
drive more research and studies for mitigating the COVID-19 outbreak.

BACKGROUND: Emotional Intelligence (EI) has been linked to burnout, job 
satisfaction, and work performance among resident physicians. Individuals with a 
growth mindset believe intelligence and ability are traits that can be increased 
or improved upon through learning. EI and mindset have yet to be studied among 
plastic surgeons in the United States.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: An online survey was distributed to plastic surgery 
residents and general surgery residents at a single institution containing a 
validated EI survey tool (TEIQue-SF). Second, a survey was sent to all plastic 
surgery residents in the United States containing the TEIQue-SF and a validated 
survey tool to assess mindset (ITIS).
RESULTS: The response rate for the local study was 82% (plastic surgery) and 75% 
(general surgery). Only 7.8% of plastic surgery residents had any prior formal 
EI training or education. Mean global EI scores of local plastic surgery 
residents were higher than the normative population sample (P <0.0001). Plastic 
surgery and general surgery residents had similar EI scores. Integrated 
residents and junior plastic surgery residents had higher Well-Being scores 
compared to independent (P = 0.04) and senior residents (P = 0.04). Sixty-four 
plastic surgery residents completed the national survey. No correlation was 
found between EI and ITIS scores among the national plastic surgery resident 
cohort.
CONCLUSION: Despite different work profiles, general surgery and plastic surgery 
residents may have similar EI profiles. Mindset does not appear to correlate to 
EI domains. Future studies will focus on how EI and mindset may develop over the 
course of residency training and their relationship to overall resident 
wellness.

AIMS: To improve short-and long-term predictions of mortality and atrial 
fibrillation (AF) among patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) from a 
nationwide population using neural networks (NN).
METHODS AND RESULTS: The Swedish National Patient Register and the Cause of 
Death Register were used to identify all patients with CHD born from 1970 to 
2017. A total of 71 941 CHD patients were identified and followed-up from birth 
until the event or end of study in 2017. Based on data from a nationwide 
population, a NN model was obtained to predict mortality and AF. Logistic 
regression (LR) based on the same data was used as a baseline comparison. Of 71 
941 CHD patients, a total of 5768 died (8.02%) and 995 (1.38%) developed AF over 
time with a mean follow-up time of 16.47 years (standard deviation 12.73 years). 
The performance of NN models in predicting the mortality and AF was higher than 
the performance of LR regardless of the complexity of the disease, with an 
average area under the receiver operating characteristic of >0.80 and >0.70, 
respectively. The largest differences were observed in mortality and complexity 
of CHD over time.
CONCLUSION: We found that NN can be used to predict mortality and AF on a 
nationwide scale using data that are easily obtainable by clinicians. In 
addition, NN showed a high performance overall and, in most cases, with better 
performance for prediction as compared with more traditional regression methods.

BACKGROUND: Surgical videos are now being used for performance review and 
educational purposes; however, broad use is still limited due to time 
constraints. To make video review more efficient, we implemented Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) algorithms to detect surgical workflow and technical 
approaches.
METHODS: Participants (N = 200) performed a simulated open bowel repair. The 
operation included two major phases: (1) Injury Identification and (2) Suture 
Repair. Accordingly, a phase detection algorithm (MobileNetV2+GRU) was 
implemented to automatically detect the two phases using video data. In 
addition, participants were noted to use three different technical approaches 
when running the bowel: (1) use of both hands, (2) use of one hand and one tool, 
or (3) use of two tools. To discern the three technical approaches, an object 
detection (YOLOv3) algorithm was implemented to recognize objects that were 
commonly used during the Injury Identification phase (hands versus tools).
RESULTS: The phase detection algorithm achieved high precision (recall) when 
segmenting the two phases: Injury Identification (86 ± 9% [81 ± 12%]) and Suture 
Repair (81 ± 6% [81 ± 16%]). When evaluating three technical approaches in 
running the bowel, the object detection algorithm achieved high average 
precisions (Hands [99.32%] and Tools [94.47%]). The three technical approaches 
showed no difference in execution time (Kruskal-Wallis Test: P= 0.062) or injury 
identification (not missing an injury) (Chi-squared: P= 0.998).
CONCLUSIONS: The AI algorithms showed high precision when segmenting surgical 
workflow and identifying technical approaches. Automation of these techniques 
for surgical video databases has great potential to facilitate efficient 
performance review.

Intraoperative optical coherence tomography (OCT) was so far only available as a 
microscope-integrated or handheld device. Recently, this technology has been 
integrated into a femtosecond (FS) laser. This pilot study analyzed the 
potential of intraoperative imaging using OCT during FS-assisted procedures of 
the anterior eye segment. Therefore, intraoperatively acquired videos using 
FS-integrated intraoperative OCT (laser-integrated [LI] OCT) in 14 patients 
(Victus, Bausch & Lomb) were analyzed in different surgical procedures. The 
results showed that all surgical steps could be successfully visualized by 
LI-OCT. LI-OCT added important information regarding the depth and location of 
the incisions and dissection planes. Moreover, dynamic processes could be 
observed in real-time. LI-OCT represents a new imaging technology that makes it 
possible to visualize intraoperative steps during FS-assisted surgery. In the 
future, automatic image analysis based on artificial intelligence could be 
helpful to detect complications at an early stage and to automatically stop the 
laser process in relevant constellations.

Model-Driven Deep Learning Method for Pancreatic Cancer Segmentation Based on 
Spiral-Transformation.

Chen X, Chen Z, Li J, Zhang YD, Lin X, Qian X.

Pancreatic cancer is a lethal malignant tumor with one of the worst prognoses. 
Accurate segmentation of pancreatic cancer is vital in clinical diagnosis and 
treatment. Due to the unclear boundary and small size of cancers, it is 
challenging to both manually annotate and automatically segment cancers. 
Considering 3D information utilization and small sample sizes, we propose a 
model-driven deep learning method for pancreatic cancer segmentation based on 
spiral transformation. Specifically, a spiral-transformation algorithm with 
uniform sampling was developed to map 3D images onto 2D planes while preserving 
the spatial relationship between textures, thus addressing the challenge in 
effectively applying 3D contextual information in a 2D model. This study is the 
first to introduce spiral transformation in a segmentation task to provide 
effective data augmentation, alleviating the issue of small sample size. 
Moreover, a transformation-weight-corrected module was embedded into the deep 
learning model to unify the entire framework. It can achieve 2D segmentation and 
corresponding 3D rebuilding constraint to overcome non-unique 3D rebuilding 
results due to the uniform and dense sampling. A smooth regularization based on 
rebuilding prior knowledge was also designed to optimize segmentation results. 
The extensive experiments showed that the proposed method achieved a promising 
segmentation performance on multi-parametric MRIs, where T2, T1, ADC, DWI images 
obtained the DSC of 65.6%, 64.0%, 64.5%, 65.3%, respectively. This method can 
provide a novel paradigm to efficiently apply 3D information and augment sample 
sizes in the development of artificial intelligence for cancer segmentation. Our 
source codes will be released at https://github.com/SJTUBME-QianLab/ 
Spiral-Segmentation.

BACKGROUND: Clinical High Risk (CHS) for psychosis is a state in which positive 
symptoms are predominant but do not reach a level of severity that fulfils the 
criteria for a psychotic episode. The aim of this study has been to investigate 
whether cognition in subjects with newly detected CHR affects the longitudinal 
development of positive symptoms.
METHODS: Fifty-three CHR individuals fulfilling the criteria for attenuated 
positive syndrome in the Structural Interview for Prodromal Syndromes (SIPS) 
were included. At inclusion, all participants completed a neurocognitive battery 
consisting of tests measuring attention, verbal memory, verbal fluency, 
executive functions and general intelligence. Cognitive domain z-scores were 
defined by contrasting with observed scores of a group of matched healthy 
controls (n = 40). Associations between cognitive performance at inclusion and 
longitudinal measures of positive symptoms were assessed by using generalised 
linear models including non-linear effects of time. All regression models were 
adjusted for age and gender.
RESULTS: Overall, SIPS positive symptoms declined over the time period, with a 
steeper decline during the first six months. Deficits in executive functions 
were assossiated witn a higher load of positive symptoms at baseline (p=0.006), 
but also to a faster improvement (p=0.030), wheras those with poor verbal 
fluency improved more slowly (p=0.018).
CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first study that follows CHR subjects 
by means of frequent clinical interviews over a sustained period of time. The 
study provides evidence of an association between executive functions, including 
verbal fluency, with the evolvement of positive symptoms.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: We aimed to develop a convolutional neural network 
(CNN)-based object detection model for the discrimination of gastric 
subepithelial tumors, such as gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), and 
leiomyomas, in endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) images.
METHODS: We used 376 images from 114 patients with histologically confirmed 
gastric GIST or leiomyoma to train the EUS-CNN. We constructed the EUS-CNN using 
an EfficientNet CNN model for feature extraction and a weighted bi-directional 
feature pyramid network for object detection. We assessed the performance of our 
EUS-CNN by calculating its accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under 
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) using a validation set of 170 
images from 54 patients. Four EUS experts and 15 EUS trainees were asked to 
judge the same validation dataset, and the diagnostic yields were compared 
between the EUS-CNN and human assessments.
RESULTS: In the per-image analysis, the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and 
AUC of our EUS-CNN were 95.6%, 82.1%, 91.2%, and 0.9234, respectively. In the 
per-patient analysis, the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and AUC for our 
object detection model were 100.0%, 85.7%, 96.3%, and 0.9929, respectively. The 
EUS-CNN outperformed human assessment in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and 
negative predictive value.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed the EUS-CNN system, which demonstrated high diagnostic 
ability for gastric GIST prediction. This EUS-CNN system can be helpful not only 
for less-experienced endoscopists but also for experienced ones. Additional EUS 
image accumulation and prospective studies are required alongside validation in 
a large multicenter trial.

This paper proposes a wavelet and artificial intelligence-enabled rapid and 
efficient testing procedure for patients with Severe Acute Respiratory 
Coronavirus Syndrome (SARS-nCoV) through a deep learning approach from thoracic 
X-ray images. Presently, the virus infection is diagnosed primarily by a process 
called the real-time Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR) 
based on its genetic prints. This whole procedure takes a substantial amount of 
time to identify and diagnose the patients infected by the virus. The proposed 
research uses a wavelet-based convolution neural network architectures to detect 
SARS-nCoV. CNN is pre-trained on the ImageNet and trained end-to-end using 
thoracic X-ray images. To execute Discrete Wavelet Transforms (DWT), the 
available mother wavelet functions from different families, namely Haar, 
Daubechies, Symlet, Biorthogonal, Coiflet, and Discrete Meyer, were considered. 
Two-level decomposition via DWT is adopted to extract prominent features 
peripheral and subpleural ground-glass opacities, often in the lower lobes 
explicitly from thoracic X-ray images to suppress noise effect, further 
enhancing the signal to noise ratio. The proposed wavelet-based deep learning 
models of both, two-class instances (COVID vs. Normal) and four-class instances 
(COVID-19 vs. PNA bacterial vs. PNA viral vs. Normal) were validated from 
publicly available databases using k-Fold Cross Validation (k-Fold CV) 
technique. In addition to these X-ray images, images of recent COVID-19 patients 
were further used to examine the model's practicality and real-time feasibility 
in combating the current pandemic situation. It was observed that the Symlet 7 
approximation component with two-level manifested the highest test accuracy of 
98.87%, followed by Biorthogonal 2.6 with an efficiency of 98.73%. While the 
test accuracy for Symlet 7 and Biorthogonal 2.6 is high, Haar and Daubechies 
with two levels have demonstrated excellent validation accuracy on unseen data. 
It was also observed that the precision, the recall rate, and the dice 
similarity coefficient for four-class instances were 98%, 98%, and 99%, 
respectively, using the proposed algorithm.

PURPOSE:  Since artificial intelligence is transitioning from an experimental 
stage to clinical implementation, the aim of our study was to evaluate the 
performance of a commercial, computer-aided detection algorithm of computed 
tomography pulmonary angiograms regarding the presence of pulmonary embolism in 
the emergency room.
MATERIALS AND METHODS:  This retrospective study includes all pulmonary computed 
tomography angiogram studies performed in a large emergency department over a 
period of 36 months that were analyzed by two radiologists experienced in 
emergency radiology to set a reference standard. Original reports and 
computer-aided detection results were compared regarding the detection of lobar, 
segmental, and subsegmental pulmonary embolism. All computer-aided detection 
findings were analyzed concerning the underlying pathology. False-positive 
findings were correlated to the contrast-to-noise ratio.
RESULTS:  Expert reading revealed pulmonary embolism in 182 of 1229 patients 
(49 % men, 10-97 years) with a total of 504 emboli. The computer-aided detection 
algorithm reported 3331 findings, including 258 (8 %) true-positive findings and 
3073 (92 %) false-positive findings. Computer-aided detection analysis showed a 
sensitivity of 47 % (95 %CI: 33-61 %) on the lobar level and 50 % (95 %CI 
43-56 %) on the subsegmental level. On average, there were 2.25 false-positive 
findings per study (median 2, range 0-25). There was no significant correlation 
between the number of false-positive findings and the contrast-to-noise ratio 
(Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient = 0.09). Soft tissue (61.0 %) and 
pulmonary veins (24.1 %) were the most common underlying reasons for 
false-positive findings.
CONCLUSION:  Applied to a population at a large emergency room, the tested 
commercial computer-aided detection algorithm faced relevant performance 
challenges that need to be addressed in future development projects.
KEY POINTS:   · Computed tomography pulmonary angiograms are frequently acquired 
in emergency radiology.. · Computer-aided detection algorithms (CADs) can 
support image analysis.. · CADs face challenges regarding false-positive and 
false-negative findings.. · Radiologists using CADs need to be aware of these 
limitations.. · Further software improvements are necessary ahead of 
implementation in the daily routine..

Publisher: ZIEL:  Da zunehmend Anwendungen künstlicher Intelligenz im klinischen 
Alltag implementiert werden, war das Ziel unserer Studie, die Leistung eines 
kommerziellen, computerassistierten Detektionsalgorithmus für 
Lungenarterienembolien in Computertomografie-Pulmonalisangiografien im Rahmen 
einer Notfallbefundung zu analysieren.
MATERIAL UND METHODEN:  In diese retrospektive Studie wurden alle 
Computertomografie-Pulmonalisangiografien eingeschlossen, die über einen 
Zeitraum von 36 Monaten in einer großen deutschen Notaufnahme gefahren wurden. 
Alle eingeschlossenen Untersuchungen wurden von 2 in Notfallradiologie 
erfahrenen Radiologen bewertet, um einen Referenzstandard festzulegen. Die 
Originalbefunde wurden mit den Ergebnissen des computerassistierten 
Detektionsalgorithmus in Bezug auf die Erkennung lobärer, segmentaler und 
subsegmentaler Lungenarterienembolien verglichen. Für alle Ergebnisse des 
computerbasierten Detektionsalgorithmus wurde die zugrunde liegende Pathologie 
definiert. Falsch positive Ergebnisse des Detektionsalgorithmus wurden mit dem 
Kontrast-Rausch-Verhältnis verglichen.
ERGEBNISSE:  Im Rahmen der Referenzbefundung wurden 504 Emboli in 182 von 
insgesamt 1229 Patienten (49 % männlich, 10–97 Jahre) detektiert. Der 
computerassistierte Detektionsalgorithmus zeigte insgesamt 3331 Ergebnisse an, 
hiervon waren 258 (8 %) richtig positiv und 3073 (92 %) falsch positiv. Die 
Sensitivität des Detektionsalgorithmus betrug 47 % (95 %-Konfidenzintervall 
33–61 %) für lobäre und 50 % (95 %-Konfidenzintervall 43–56 %) für subsegmentale 
Lungenarterienembolien. Im Durchschnitt wurden 2,25 Ergebnisse pro Untersuchung 
(Median 2, 0–25) angezeigt. Es gab keine signifikante Korrelation zwischen der 
Anzahl der falsch positiven Ergebnisse und dem Kontrast-Rausch-Verhältnis 
(Spearman’s Rangkorrelationskoeffizient = 0,09). Weichteilgewebe (61,0 %) und 
Pulmonalvenen (24,1 %) waren die häufigsten Ursachen für falsch positive 
Ergebnisse.
SCHLUSSFOLGERUNG:  Die Anwendung des getesteten computerassistierten 
Detektionsalgorithmus auf ein Patientenkollektiv einer großen Notaufnahme deckt 
die Schwachstellen des Algorithmus auf, die im Rahmen zukünftiger 
Projektentwicklungen optimiert werden sollten.
KERNAUSSAGEN:   · Die computertomografische Pulmonalisangiografie ist eine 
häufige Anforderung in der Notfallversorgung.. · Computerassistierte 
Detektionsalgorithmen können bei der Bildanalyse helfen.. · Die 
Detektionsalgorithmen weisen noch Schwächen bei falsch positiven und falsch 
negativen Befunden auf.. · Radiolog*innen müssen sich der Limitationen der 
Detektionsalgorithmen bewusst sein..

Improving convolutional neural networks performance for image classification 
using test time augmentation: a case study using MURA dataset.

Bone fractures are one of the main causes to visit the emergency room (ER); the 
primary method to detect bone fractures is using X-Ray images. X-Ray images 
require an experienced radiologist to classify them; however, an experienced 
radiologist is not always available in the ER. An accurate automatic X-Ray image 
classifier in the ER can help reduce error rates by providing an instant second 
opinion to the emergency doctor. Deep learning is an emerging trend in 
artificial intelligence, where an automatic classifier can be trained to 
classify musculoskeletal images. Image augmentations techniques have proven 
their usefulness in increasing the deep learning model's performance. Usually, 
in the image classification domain, the augmentation techniques are used during 
training the network and not during the testing phase. Test time augmentation 
(TTA) can increase the model prediction by providing, with a negligible 
computational cost, several transformations for the same image. In this paper, 
we investigated the effect of TTA on image classification performance on the 
MURA dataset. Nine different augmentation techniques were evaluated to determine 
their performance compared to predictions without TTA. Two ensemble techniques 
were assessed as well, the majority vote and the average vote. Based on our 
results, TTA increased classification performance significantly, especially for 
models with a low score.

BACKGROUND: Humans are exposed to a mixture of metals during their lifetime; 
however, evidence of neurotoxicity of such mixtures in critical time windows is 
still insufficient. We aimed to elucidate the associations of four metals 
mixture across multiple time points with children's intelligence quotient (IQ) 
in a prospective cohort study.
METHODS: Prenatal exposure and exposure at age 4 and 6 years to four types of 
blood metals, namely lead, mercury, cadmium, and manganese were quantified in 
502 pregnant women and their children who participated in the Environment and 
Development Cohort study. Children' s IQ scores were assessed using the Wechsler 
Intelligence Scale at age 6. Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR), quantile 
g-computation models, and elastic net (ENET) models were used to assess the 
associations of their blood metals mixture with IQ scores.
RESULTS: Multivariate linear regression models indicated that postnatal blood 
manganese exposure at the age of 4 years was significantly negatively associated 
with children's IQ [β =  - 5.99, 95% confidence interval (CI): -11.37 
to - 0.61]. In the multi-chemical BKMR and quantile g-computation model, 
statistically significant inverse associations were found between the mixture of 
prenatal and postnatal metals and children's IQ score (Difference in children' 
IQ per quartile increase: -2.83; 95% CI: -5.28, -0.38). Interestingly, we found 
that manganese levels at both age of 4 and 6 years were contributing factors to 
children's IQ in the mixture models, namely, BKMR, quantile g-computation, and 
ENET models.
CONCLUSIONS: Multi-pollutant mixtures of prenatal and postnatal exposures to 
four metals affected child IQ at 6 years of age. We found a relationship between 
manganese exposure at both age 4, and 6 years and children's IQ. Additional 
studies are warranted to confirm these associations and to control the exposure 
to different metals during pregnancy and preschool childhood.

Millions of positive COVID-19 patients are suffering from the pandemic around 
the world, a critical step in the management and treatment is severity 
assessment, which is quite challenging with the limited medical resources. 
Currently, several artificial intelligence systems have been developed for the 
severity assessment. However, imprecise severity assessment and insufficient 
data are still obstacles. To address these issues, we proposed a novel 
deep-learning-based framework for the fine-grained severity assessment using 3D 
CT scans, by jointly performing lung segmentation and lesion segmentation. The 
main innovations in the proposed framework include: 1) decomposing 3D CT scan 
into multi-view slices for reducing the complexity of 3D model, 2) integrating 
prior knowledge (dual-Siamese channels and clinical metadata) into our model for 
improving the model performance. We evaluated the proposed method on 1301 CT 
scans of 449 COVID-19 cases collected by us, our method achieved an accuracy of 
86.7% for four-way classification, with the sensitivities of 92%, 78%, 95%, 89% 
for four stages. Moreover, ablation study demonstrated the effectiveness of the 
major components in our model. This indicates that our method may contribute a 
potential solution to severity assessment of COVID-19 patients using CT images 
and clinical metadata.

Proa valdearinnoensis is a relatively large-headed and stocky iguanodontian 
dinosaur from the latest Early Cretaceous of Spain. Its braincase is known from 
three specimens. Similar to that of other dinosaurs, it shows a mosaic 
ossification pattern in which most of the bones seem to have fused together 
indistinguishably while a few (frontoparietal, basioccipital) might have 
remained loosely attached. The endocasts of the three specimens are described 
based on CT data and digital reconstructions. They show unmistakable 
morphological similarities with the endocast of closely related taxa, such as 
Sirindhorna khoratensis (which is close in age but from Thailand). This supports 
a high conservatism of the endocranial cavity. The issue of volumetric 
correspondence between endocranial cavity and brain in dinosaurs is analyzed. 
Although a brain-to-endocranial cavity (BEC) index of 0.50 has been 
traditionally used, we employ instead 0.73. This is indeed the mid-value between 
the situation in adults of Alligator mississippiensis and Gallus gallus, which 
are members of the extant bracketing taxa of dinosaurs (Crocodilia and Aves). We 
thence gauge the level of encephalization of P. valdearinnoensis through the 
calculation of the encephalization quotient (EQ), which remains valuable as a 
metric for assessing the degree of cognitive function in extinct taxa, 
especially those with fully ossified braincases like dinosaurs and other 
archosaurs. The EQ obtained for P. valdearinnoensis (3.611) suggests that this 
species was significantly more encephalized than most if not all extant 
nonavian, nonmammalian amniotes. Our work adds to the growing body of data 
concerning theoretical cognitive capabilities in dinosaurs and supports the idea 
that an increasing encephalization was fostered not only in theropods but also 
in parallel in the shorter-lived lineage of ornithopods. P. valdearinnoensis was 
ill-equipped to respond to theropod dinosaurs and possibly lived in groups as a 
strategy to mitigate the risk of being predated upon. We hypothesize that 
group-living and protracted caring of juveniles in this and possibly many other 
iguanodontian ornithopods favored a degree of encephalization that was 
outstanding by reptile standards.

Delirium is a highly relevant complication of surgical interventions. Current 
research indicates that despite increased awareness for delirium, it is often 
overlooked. We implemented an AI-based tool to monitor delirium in cardiac 
surgery patients in our specialist clinic. This appears to be a promising 
approach to improve detection of delirium, especially for underrecognized forms 
and in peripheral wards without intensive screening. We present a case in which 
the AI identified delirium, confirmed by our routine screening and specialist 
evaluation.

Pancreatic cancer is a highly malignant digestive system tumor with a poor 
prognosis. Most pancreatic cancer patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage or 
even metastasis due to its highly aggressive characteristics and lack of typical 
early symptoms. Thus, an early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is crucial for 
improving its prognosis. Currently, screening is often applied in high-risk 
individuals to achieve the early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Fully 
understanding the risk factors of pancreatic cancer and pathogenesis could help 
us identify the high-risk population and achieve early diagnosis and timely 
treatment of pancreatic cancer. Notably, accumulating studies have been 
undertaken to improve the detection rate of different imaging methods and the 
diagnostic accuracy of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration 
(EUS-FNA) which is the golden standard for pancreatic cancer diagnosis. In 
addition, there are currently no biomarkers with sufficient sensitivity and 
specificity for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer to be applied in the clinic. 
As the only serum biomarker approved by the United States Food and Drug 
Administration, carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) is not recommended to be used 
in the early screening of pancreatic cancer because of its limited specificity. 
Recently, increasing numbers of studies focused on the discovering of novel 
serum biomarkers and exploring their combination with CA19-9 in the detection of 
pancreatic cancer. Besides, the application of liquid biopsy involving 
circulating tumor cells (CTCs), circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), microRNAs 
(miRNAs), and exosomes in blood and biomarkers in urine, and saliva in 
pancreatic cancer diagnosis are drawing more and more attention. Furthermore, 
many innovative technologies such as artificial intelligence, computer-aided 
diagnosis system, metabolomics technology, ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) 
associated technologies, and novel nanomaterials have been tested for the early 
diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and have shown promising prospects. Hence, this 
review aims to summarize the recent progress in the development of early 
screening and diagnostic methods, including imaging, pathological examination, 
serological examination, liquid biopsy, as well as other potential diagnostic 
strategies for pancreatic cancer.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: Artificial intelligence has been extensively studied to 
assist clinicians in polyp detection, but such systems usually require expansive 
processing power, making them prohibitively expensive and hindering wide 
adaption. The current study used a fast object detection algorithm, known as the 
YOLOv3 algorithm, to achieve real-time polyp detection on a laptop. In addition, 
we evaluated and classified the causes of false detections to further improve 
accuracy.
METHODS: The YOLOv3 algorithm was trained and validated with 6038 and 2571 polyp 
images, respectively. Videos from live colonoscopies in a tertiary center and 
those obtained from public databases were used for the training and validation 
sets. The algorithm was tested on 10 unseen videos from the CVC-Video ClinicDB 
dataset. Only bounding boxes with an intersection over union area of > 0.3 were 
considered positive predictions.
RESULTS: Polyp detection rate in our study was 100%, with the algorithm able to 
detect every polyp in each video. Sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score were 
74.1%, 85.1%, and 83.3, respectively. The algorithm achieved a speed of 
61.2 frames per second (fps) on a desktop RTX2070 GPU and 27.2 fps on a laptop 
GTX2060 GPU. Nearly a quarter of false negatives happened when the polyps were 
at the corner of an image. Image blurriness accounted for approximately 3% and 
9% of false positive and false negative detections, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The YOLOv3 algorithm can achieve real-time poly detection with high 
accuracy and speed on a desktop GPU, making it low cost and accessible to most 
endoscopy centers worldwide.

Accurate and timely monitoring of streamflow and its variation is crucial for 
water resources management in watersheds. This study aimed at evaluating the 
performance of two process-driven conceptual rainfall-runoff models (HBV: 
Hydrologiska Byråns Vattenbalansavdelning, and NRECA: Non Recorded Catchment 
Areas) and seven hybrid models based on three artificial intelligence (AI) 
methods (adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), support vector machine 
(SVM), and group method of data handling (GMDH)) in simulating streamflow in 
four river basins in Indonesia. HBV and NRECA were developed based on 
precipitation data. Various combinations of 1-month lagged precipitation data 
together with outputs of HBV and NRECA were used for developing ANFIS and SVM 
models, and the best results of ANFIS and SVM formed the inputs to GMDH. Results 
showed that AI-based hybrid models have generally led to more accurate 
streamflow estimates compared with HBV and NRECA, and the GMDH model had the 
best performance at Cipero, Kedungdowo, Notog, and Sukowati stations, with RMSEs 
of 12.21, 6.07, 20.35, and 24.2 m3 s-1, respectively. More accurate estimation 
of peak values in training set at Cipero and Sukowati stations, and in both 
training and testing sets at Kedungdowo station was another advantage of GMDH. 
Hybrid models based on AI methods can be suitable alternatives to hydrological 
models, particularly in watersheds where there is a lack of measured data (e.g. 
climatic parameters, land cover-plant growth data, soil data, stream conditions, 
and properties of groundwater aquifers), provided that appropriate inputs are 
used.

The increasing population of the elderly and motion-impaired people brings a 
huge challenge to our social system. However, the walking stick as their 
essential tool has rarely been investigated into its potential capabilities 
beyond basic physical support, such as activity monitoring, tracing, and 
accident alert. Here, we report a walking stick powered by ultra-low-frequency 
human motion and equipped with deep-learning-enabled advanced sensing features 
to provide a healthcare-monitoring platform for motion-impaired users. A 
linear-to-rotary structure is designed to achieve highly efficient energy 
harvesting from the linear motion of a walking stick with ultralow frequency. 
Besides, two kinds of self-powered triboelectric sensors are proposed and 
integrated to extract the motion features of the walking stick. Augmented 
sensing functionalities with high accuracies have been enabled by 
deep-learning-based data analysis, including identity recognition, disability 
evaluation, and motion status distinguishing. Furthermore, a self-sustainable 
Internet of Things (IoT) system with global positioning system tracing and 
environmental temperature and humidity amenity sensing functions is obtained. 
Combined with the aforementioned functionalities, this walking stick is 
demonstrated in various usage scenarios as a caregiver for real-time well-being 
status and activity monitoring. The caregiving walking stick shows the potential 
of being an intelligent aid for motion-impaired users to help them live life 
with adequate autonomy and safety.

Disruptive innovations in the clinical laboratory: catching the wave of 
precision diagnostics.

Disruptive innovation is an invention that disrupts an existing market and 
creates a new one by providing a different set of values, which ultimately 
overtakes the existing market. Typically, when disruptive innovations are 
introduced, their performance is initially less than existing standard 
technologies, but because of their ability to bring the cost down, and with 
gradual improvement, they end up replacing established service 
standards.Disruptive technologies have their fingerprints in health care. 
Pathology and laboratory medicine are fertile soils for disruptive innovations 
because they are heavily reliant on technology. Disruptive innovations have 
resulted in a revolution of our diagnostic ability and will take laboratory 
medicine to the next level of patient care. There are several examples of 
disruptive innovations in the clinical laboratory. Digitizing pathology practice 
is an example of disruptive technology, with many advantages and an extended 
scope of applications. Next-generation sequencing can be disruptive in two ways. 
The first is by replacing an array of laboratory tests, which each requires 
expensive and specialized instruments and expertise, with a single 
cost-effective technology. The second is by disrupting the current paradigm of 
the clinical laboratory as a diagnostic service by taking it into a new era of 
preventive or primary care pathology. Other disruptive innovations include the 
use of dry chemistry reagents in chemistry analyzers and also point of care 
testing. The use of artificial intelligence is another promising disruptive 
innovation that can transform the future of pathology and laboratory medicine. 
Another emerging disruptive concept is the integration of two fields of medicine 
to create an interrelated discipline such as "histogenomics and radiohistomics." 
Another recent disruptive innovation in laboratory medicine is the use of social 
media in clinical practice, education, and publication.There are multiple 
reasons to encourage disruptive innovations in the clinical laboratory, 
including the escalating cost of health care, the need for better accessibility 
of diagnostic care, and the increased demand on the laboratory in the era of 
precision diagnostics. There are, however, a number of challenges that need to 
be overcome such as the significant resistance to disruptive innovations by 
current technology providers and governmental regulatory bodies. The hesitance 
from health care providers and insurance companies must also be 
addressed.Adoption of disruptive innovations requires a multifaceted approach 
that involves orchestrated solutions to key aspects of the process, including 
creating successful business models, multidisciplinary collaborations, and 
innovative accreditation and regulatory oversight. It also must be coupled with 
successful commercialization plans and modernization of health care structure. 
Fostering a culture of disruptive innovation requires establishing unique 
collaborative models between academia and industry. It also requires uncovering 
new sources of unconventional funding that are open to high-risk high-reward 
projects. It should also be matched with innovative thinking, including new 
approaches for delivery of care and identifying novel cohorts of patients who 
can benefit from disruptive technology.

Down syndrome (DS) is typically recognizable in those who present with multiple 
dysmorphism, especially in regard to facial phenotypes. However, as the 
presentation of DS in neonates is less obvious, a phenotype-based presumptive 
diagnosis is more challenging. Recently, an artificial intelligence (AI) 
application, Face2Gene, was developed to help physicians recognize specific 
genetic syndromes by using two-dimensional facial photos. As of yet, there has 
not been any study comparing accuracy among physicians or applications. Our 
objective was to compare the facial recognition accuracy of DS in Thai neonates, 
using facial photographs, among physicians and the Face2Gene. Sixty-four Thai 
neonates at Thammasat University Hospital, with genetic testing and signed 
parental consent, were divided into a DS group (25) and non-DS group (39). 
Non-DS was further divided into unaffected (19) and those affected with other 
syndromes (20). Our results revealed physician accuracy (89%) was higher than 
the Face2Gene (81%); however, the application was higher in sensitivity (100%) 
than physicians (86%). While this application can serve as a helpful assistant 
in facilitating any genetic syndrome such as DS, to aid clinicians in 
recognizing DS facial features in neonates, it is not a replacement for 
well-trained doctors.

Fiber-based stretchable electronics with feasibility of weaving into textiles 
and advantages of light-weight, long-term stability, conformability and easy 
integration are highly desirable for wearable electronics to realize 
personalized medicine, artificial intelligence and human health monitoring. 
Herein, a fiber strain sensor is developed based on the Ti3C2Tx MXene wrapped by 
poly(vinylidenefluoride-co-trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE)) polymer nanofibers 
prepared via electrostatic spinning. Owing to the good conductivity of Ti3C2Tx 
and unique 3D reticular structure with wave shape, the resistance of 
Ti3C2Tx@P(VDF-TrFE) polymer nanofibers changes under external force, thus 
providing remarkable strain inducted sensing performance. As-fabricated sensor 
exhibits high gauge factor (GF) of 108.8 in range of 45-66% strain, rapid 
response of 19 ms, and outstanding durability over 1600 stretching/releasing 
cycles. The strain sensor is able to monitor vigorous human motions (finger or 
wrist bending) and subtle physiological signals (blinking, pulse or voice 
recognition) in real-time. Moreover, a data glove is designed to connect 
different gestures and expressions to form an intelligent gesture-expression 
control system, further confirming the practicability of our Ti3C2Tx@P(VDF-TrFE) 
strain sensors in multifunctional wearable electronic devices.

INTRODUCTION: Digital microscopy systems are beginning to replace traditional 
light microscopes for morphologic analysis of blood films, but these are 
geographically restricted to individual computers and technically limited by 
manufacturer's constraints. We explored the use of a scanner-agnostic web-based 
artificial intelligence (AI) system to assess the accuracy of white blood cell 
(WBC) differentials and blast identification in haematological malignancies.
METHODS: Digitized images of 20 normal and 124 abnormal peripheral blood films 
were uploaded to the web-based platform (Techcyte©) and WBC differentials 
performed using the online AI software. Digital images were viewed for accuracy 
and manual cell reassignment was performed where necessary. Results were 
correlated to the 'gold standard' of manual microscopy for each WBC class, and 
sensitivity and specificity of blast identification were calculated.
RESULTS: The AI digital differential was very strongly correlated to microscopy 
(r > .8) for most normal cell types and did not require any manual reassignment. 
The AI digital differential was less reliable for abnormal blood films 
(r = .50-.87), but could be greatly improved by manual assessment of digital 
images for most cell types (r > .95) with the exception of immature granulocytes 
(r = .62). For blast identification, initial AI digital differentials showed 96% 
sensitivity and 25% specificity, which was improved to 99% and 84%, 
respectively, after manual digital review.
CONCLUSIONS: The Techcyte platform allowed remote viewing and manual analysis of 
digitized slides that was comparable to microscopy. The AI software produced 
adequate WBC differentials for normal films and had high sensitivity for blast 
identification in malignant films.

INTRODUCTION: The concept of custom total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is explored 
with specific attention to current limitations. Arguments in favor of custom TKA 
are the anatomic and functional variability we encounter in our patients. The 
biggest conceptual challenge is to marry the need for correction of deformity 
with the ambition to stay as close as possible to original anatomy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Pubmed search was performed on the following terms: 
'patient specific implant', 'custom made implant', 'custom implant', 'total knee 
arthroplasty' and 'total knee replacement'. These studies were evaluated for the 
following intra- and post-operative variables: blood loss, hospital stay, range 
of motion, patient-reported outcome measures, limb and implant alignment, 
implant fit, tibiofemoral kinematics, complications and revision rates.
RESULTS: Out of 1117 studies found with the initial search, a total of 17 
articles were included in the final analysis. In eight out of the 17 (47%) 
studies, either the research was commercially funded or one of the authors had a 
conflict of interest related to the work. 11 out of 17 studies included a 
control group in their study setup. Of those studies that included a control 
group, both superior and inferior results compared to off-the-shelf implants 
have been reported.
CONCLUSION: Custom knee implants are the next step in matching the geometric 
features of the prosthesis to the anatomy of the individual patient, after 
several iterations that added asymmetry and sizes in the existing implants. 
Several companies have proven that it is feasible to produce these implants in a 
safe way. An overview of current literature reveals the lack of strong 
methodological studies that prove the value of this new technology. Custom knee 
implants face conceptual and practical difficulties, some of which might be 
overcome with technological advances, such as robotics and artificial 
intelligence.

PURPOSE: This work was aimed at designing a deep-learning-based approach for MR 
image phase unwrapping to improve the robustness and efficiency of traditional 
methods.
METHODS: A deep learning network called PHU-NET was designed for MR phase 
unwrapping. In this network, a novel training data generation method was 
proposed to simulate the wrapping patterns in MR phase images. The wrapping 
boundary and wrapping counts were explicitly estimated and used for network 
training. The proposed method was quantitatively evaluated and compared to other 
methods using a number of simulated datasets with varying signal-to-noise ratio 
(SNR) and MR phase images from various parts of the human body.
RESULTS: The results showed that our method performed better in the simulated 
data even under an extremely low SNR. The proposed method had less residual 
wrapping in the images from various parts of human body and worked well in the 
presence of severe anatomical discontinuity. Our method was also advantageous in 
terms of computational efficiency compared to the traditional methods.
CONCLUSION: This work proposed a robust and computationally efficient MR phase 
unwrapping method based on a deep learning network, which has promising 
performance in applications using MR phase information.

BACKGROUND: Pulmonary hypertension is a heterogeneous disease, and a significant 
portion of patients at risk for it have CT imaging available. Advanced automated 
processing techniques could be leveraged for early detection, screening, and 
development of quantitative phenotypes. Pruning and vascular tortuosity have 
been previously described in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), but the 
extent of these phenomena in arterial vs venous pulmonary vasculature and in 
exercise pulmonary hypertension (ePH) have not been described.
RESEARCH QUESTION: What are the arterial and venous manifestations of pruning 
and vascular tortuosity using CT imaging in PAH, and do they also occur in ePH?
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A cohort of patients with PAH and ePH and control 
subjects with available CT angiograms were retrospectively identified to examine 
the differential arterial and venous presence of pruning and tortuosity in 
patients with precapillary pulmonary hypertension not confounded by lung or 
thromboembolic disease. The pulmonary vasculature was reconstructed, and an 
artificial intelligence method was used to separate arteries and veins and to 
compute arterial and venous vascular volumes and tortuosity.
RESULTS: A total of 42 patients with PAH, 12 patients with ePH, and 37 control 
subjects were identified. There was relatively lower (median [interquartile 
range]) arterial small vessel volume in subjects with PAH (PAH 14.7 [11.7-16.5; 
P < .0001]) vs control subjects (16.9 [15.6-19.2]) and venous small vessel 
volume in subjects with PAH and ePH (PAH 8.0 [6.5-9.6; P < .0001]; ePH, 7.8 
[7.5-11.4; P = .004]) vs control subjects (11.5 [10.6-12.2]). Higher large 
arterial volume, however, was only observed in the pulmonary arteries (PAH 17.1 
[13.6-23.4; P < .0001] vs control subjects 11.4 [8.1-15.4]). Similarly, 
tortuosity was higher in the pulmonary arteries in the PAH group (PAH 3.5 
[3.3-3.6; P = .0002] vs control 3.2 [3.2-3.3]).
INTERPRETATION: Lower small distal pulmonary vascular volume, higher proximal 
arterial volume, and higher arterial tortuosity were observed in PAH. These can 
be quantified by using automated techniques from clinically acquired CT scans of 
patients with ePH and resting PAH.

OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aims to determine the applications of Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) that are extensively employed in the field of Orthodontics, to 
evaluate its benefits, and to discuss its potential implications in this 
speciality. Recent decades have witnessed enormous changes in our profession. 
The arrival of new and more aesthetic options in orthodontic treatment, the 
transition to a fully digital workflow, the emergence of temporary anchorage 
devices and new imaging methods all provide both patients and professionals with 
a new focus in orthodontic care.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This review was performed following the Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping 
Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. The electronic literature search was performed 
through MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane and IEEE Xplore 
databases with a 11-year time restriction: January 2010 till March 2021. No 
additional manual searches were performed.
RESULTS: The electronic literature search initially returned 311 records, and 
115 after removing duplicate references. Finally, the application of the 
inclusion criteria resulted in 17 eligible publications in the qualitative 
synthesis review.
CONCLUSION: The analysed studies demonstrated that Convolution Neural Networks 
can be used for the automatic detection of anatomical reference points on 
radiological images. In the growth and development research area, the Cervical 
Vertebral Maturation stage can be determined using an Artificial Neural Network 
model and obtain the same results as expert human observers. AI technology can 
also improve the diagnostic accuracy for orthodontic treatments, thereby helping 
the orthodontist work more accurately and efficiently.

Knowledge Implementation and Transfer With an Adaptive Learning Network for 
Real-Time Power Management of the Plug-in Hybrid Vehicle.

Zhou Q, Zhao D, Shuai B, Li Y, Williams H, Xu H.

Essential decision-making tasks such as power management in future vehicles will 
benefit from the development of artificial intelligence technology for safe and 
energy-efficient operations. To develop the technique of using neural network 
and deep learning in energy management of the plug-in hybrid vehicle and 
evaluate its advantage, this article proposes a new adaptive learning network 
that incorporates a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) network with an 
adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) network. First, the ANFIS network 
is built using a new global K-fold fuzzy learning (GKFL) method for real-time 
implementation of the offline dynamic programming result. Then, the DDPG network 
is developed to regulate the input of the ANFIS network with the real-world 
reinforcement signal. The ANFIS and DDPG networks are integrated to maximize the 
control utility (CU), which is a function of the vehicle's energy efficiency and 
the battery state-of-charge. Experimental studies are conducted to testify the 
performance and robustness of the DDPG-ANFIS network. It has shown that the 
studied vehicle with the DDPG-ANFIS network achieves 8% higher CU than using the 
MATLAB ANFIS toolbox on the studied vehicle. In five simulated real-world 
driving conditions, the DDPG-ANFIS network increased the maximum mean CU value 
by 138% over the ANFIS-only network and 5% over the DDPG-only network.

AIMS: Spectrum bias can arise when a diagnostic test is derived from study 
populations with different disease spectra than the target population, resulting 
in poor generalizability. We used a real-world artificial intelligence 
(AI)-derived algorithm to detect severe aortic stenosis (AS) to experimentally 
assess the effect of spectrum bias on test performance.
METHODS AND RESULTS: All adult patients at the Mayo Clinic between 1 January 
1989 and 30 September 2019 with transthoracic echocardiograms within 180 days 
after electrocardiogram (ECG) were identified. Two models were developed from 
two distinct patient cohorts: a whole-spectrum cohort comparing severe AS to any 
non-severe AS and an extreme-spectrum cohort comparing severe AS to no AS at 
all. Model performance was assessed. Overall, 258 607 patients had valid ECG and 
echocardiograms pairs. The area under the receiver operator curve was 0.87 and 
0.91 for the whole-spectrum and extreme-spectrum models, respectively. 
Sensitivity and specificity for the whole-spectrum model was 80% and 81%, 
respectively, while for the extreme-spectrum model it was 84% and 84%, 
respectively. When applying the AI-ECG derived from the extreme-spectrum cohort 
to patients in the whole-spectrum cohort, the sensitivity, specificity, and area 
under the curve dropped to 83%, 73%, and 0.86, respectively.
CONCLUSION: While the algorithm performed robustly in identifying severe AS, 
this study shows that limiting datasets to clearly positive or negative labels 
leads to overestimation of test performance when testing an AI algorithm in the 
setting of classifying severe AS using ECG data. While the effect of the bias 
may be modest in this example, clinicians should be aware of the existence of 
such a bias in AI-derived algorithms.

Artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology has gained wide interest due to the 
development of neural network architectures with high performance in computer 
vision related tasks. As AI based software programs become more integrated into 
the clinical workflow, radiologists can benefit from better understanding the 
principles of artificial intelligence. This series aims to explain basic 
concepts of AI and its applications in medical imaging. In this article, we will 
review the background of neural network architecture and its application in 
imaging analysis.

INTRODUCTION: Anticipation of patient-specific component sizes prior to total 
knee arthroplasty (TKA) is essential to avoid excessive cost associated with 
additional surgical trays and morbidity associated with imperfect sizing. 
Current methods of size prediction, including templating, are inconsistent and 
time-consuming. Machine learning (ML) algorithms may allow for accurate TKA 
component size prediction with the ability to make predictions in real-time.
METHODS: Consecutive patients receiving primary TKA between 2012 and 2020 from 
two large tertiary academic and six community hospitals were identified. The 
primary outcomes were the final femoral and tibial component sizes extracted 
from automated inventory systems. Five ML algorithms were trained with routinely 
corrected demographic variables (age, height, weight, body mass index, and sex) 
using 80% of the study population and internally validated on an independent set 
of the remaining 20% of patients. Algorithm performance was evaluated through 
accuracy, mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean-squared error (RMSE).
RESULTS: A total of 17,283 patients that received one of 9 TKA implants from 
independent manufacturers were included. The SGB model accuracy for 
predicting ± 4-mm of the true femoral anteroposterior diameter was 83.6% and 
for ± 1 size of the true femoral component size was 95.0%. The SGB model 
accuracy for predicting ± 4-mm of the true tibial medial/lateral diameter was 
83.0% and for ± 1 size of the true tibial component size was 97.8%. Patient sex 
was the most influential feature in terms of informing the SGB model predictions 
for both femoral and tibial component sizing. A TKA implant sizing application 
was subsequently created.
CONCLUSION: Novel machine learning algorithms demonstrated good to excellent 
performance for predicting TKA component size. Patient sex appears to contribute 
an important role in predicting TKA size. A web-based real-time prediction 
application was created capable of integrating patient specific data to predict 
TKA size, which will require external validation prior to clinical use.

BACKGROUND: Patients with Crohn's disease (CD) frequently undergo abdominopelvic 
computed tomography (APCT) in the emergency department (ED). It's essential to 
diagnose clinically actionable findings (CAF) as they may need immediate 
intervention, frequently surgical. However, repeated APCT's includes increased 
ionizing radiation exposure. Guidance regarding APCT performance is mostly 
clinical and empiric.
AIMS: We used a machine learning (ML) approach for predicting CAF on APCT in the 
ED.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients with CD who 
presented to the ED and underwent APCT. CAF were defined as bowel obstruction, 
perforation, intra-abdominal abscess or complicated fistula. ML was used to 
predict the probability of having CAF on APCT, using routine clinical variables.
RESULTS: Of 101 admissions included, 44 (43.5%) had CAF on APCT. ML successfully 
identified patients at low (NPV 91.6%, CI-95% 90.6-92.5) and high (PPV 92.8%, 
CI-95%, 92.3-93.2) risk for CAF (AUROC = 0.774), using beats-per-minute, mean 
arterial pressure, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and sex. This allowed the 
construction of a risk stratification scheme according to patients' probability 
for CAF on APCT.
CONCLUSION: We present a novel artificial intelligence-based approach, utilizing 
readily available clinical variables to better select patients with CD in the ED 
for APCT. This might reduce the number of APCTs performed, avoiding related 
hazards while ensuring high-risk patients undergo APCT.

Delivering transformative therapies to patients while maintaining growth in the 
pharmaceutical industry requires an efficient use of research and development 
(R&D) resources and technologies to develop high-impact new molecular entities 
(NMEs). However, increasing global R&D competition in the pharmaceutical 
industry, growing impact of generics and biosimilars, more stringent regulatory 
requirements, as well as cost-constrained reimbursement frameworks challenge 
current business models of leading pharmaceutical companies. Big data-based 
analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) approaches have disrupted various 
industries and are having an increasing impact in the biopharmaceutical 
industry, with the promise to improve and accelerate biopharmaceutical R&D 
processes. Here, we systematically analyze, identify, assess, and categorize key 
risks across the drug discovery and development value chain using a new risk map 
approach, providing a comprehensive risk-reward analysis for pharmaceutical R&D.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of death. Colonoscopy 
is the criterion standard for detection and removal of precancerous lesions and 
has been shown to reduce mortality. The polyp miss rate during colonoscopies is 
22% to 28%. DEEP DEtection of Elusive Polyps (DEEP2) is a new polyp detection 
system based on deep learning that alerts the operator in real time to the 
presence and location of polyps. The primary outcome was the performance of 
DEEP2 on the detection of elusive polyps.
METHODS: The DEEP2 system was trained on 3611 hours of colonoscopy videos 
derived from 2 sources and was validated on a set comprising 1393 hours from a 
third unrelated source. Ground truth labeling was provided by offline 
gastroenterologist annotators who were able to watch the video in slow motion 
and pause and rewind as required. To assess applicability, stability, and user 
experience and to obtain some preliminary data on performance in a real-life 
scenario, a preliminary prospective clinical validation study was performed 
comprising 100 procedures.
RESULTS: DEEP2 achieved a sensitivity of 97.1% at 4.6 false alarms per video for 
all polyps and of 88.5% and 84.9% for polyps in the field of view for less than 
5 and 2 seconds, respectively. DEEP2 was able to detect polyps not seen by live 
real-time endoscopists or offline annotators in an average of .22 polyps per 
sequence. In the clinical validation study, the system detected an average of 
.89 additional polyps per procedure. No adverse events occurred.
CONCLUSIONS: DEEP2 has a high sensitivity for polyp detection and was effective 
in increasing the detection of polyps both in colonoscopy videos and in real 
procedures with a low number of false alarms. (Clinical trial registration 
number: NCT04693078.).

Molecular imaging is one of the pillars of precision surgery. Its applications 
range from early diagnostics to therapy planning, execution, and the accurate 
assessment of outcomes. In particular, molecular imaging solutions are in high 
demand in minimally invasive surgical strategies, such as the substantially 
increasing field of robotic surgery. This review aims at connecting the 
molecular imaging and nuclear medicine community to the rapidly expanding armory 
of surgical medical devices. Such devices entail technologies ranging from 
artificial intelligence and computer-aided visualization technologies (software) 
to innovative molecular imaging modalities and surgical navigation (hardware). 
We discuss technologies based on their role at different steps of the surgical 
workflow, i.e., from surgical decision and planning, over to target localization 
and excision guidance, all the way to (back table) surgical verification. This 
provides a glimpse of how innovations from the technology fields can realize an 
exciting future for the molecular imaging and surgery communities.

RASopathies are a group of disorders caused by pathogenic variants in the genes 
encoding Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and share overlapping 
clinical and molecular features. This study is aimed to describe the clinical 
and molecular features of 38 patients with RASopathies. Sanger or targeted 
next-generation sequencing of related genes and multiplex 
ligation-dependent-probe amplification analysis for NF1 were performed. The 
pathogenic variant detection rate was 94.4%. While PTPN11 was responsible for 
50% of 18 patients with Noonan syndrome (NS), SOS1, LZTR1, RIT1, and RAF1 were 
responsible for the remaining 27.8%, 11.1%, 5.5%, and 5.5%, respectively. Three 
variants in LZTR1 were novel, of which two were identified in the compound 
heterozygous state in a patient with intellectual disability and hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy, whereas the third variant was found in the heterozygous state in 
a patient with pulmonary stenosis and normal intelligence. We described pyloric 
stenosis, knee dislocation, and cleft palate in patients with SOS1, RIT1, and 
RAF1 variants, respectively, that was not previously reported. We detected a 
PTPN11 variant in three patients from same family with NS with multiple 
lentigines. BRAF and MAP2K2 variants were found in eight patients with 
Cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome. Two variants in HRAS were detected in two 
Costello syndrome patients, one with a mild and the other with a severe 
phenotype. While large NF1 deletions were identified in four 
Neurofibromatosis-NS patients with intellectual disability, intelligence was 
normal in one patient with missense variant. In conclusion, this study provided 
three novel variants in LZTR1 and expanded the clinical phenotype of rare 
RASopathies.

Medical artificial intelligence is cost-effective and scalable and often 
outperforms human providers, yet people are reluctant to use it. We show that 
resistance to the utilization of medical artificial intelligence is driven by 
both the subjective difficulty of understanding algorithms (the perception that 
they are a 'black box') and by an illusory subjective understanding of human 
medical decision-making. In five pre-registered experiments (1-3B: N = 2,699), 
we find that people exhibit an illusory understanding of human medical 
decision-making (study 1). This leads people to believe they better understand 
decisions made by human than algorithmic healthcare providers (studies 2A,B), 
which makes them more reluctant to utilize algorithmic than human providers 
(studies 3A,B). Fortunately, brief interventions that increase subjective 
understanding of algorithmic decision processes increase willingness to utilize 
algorithmic healthcare providers (studies 3A,B). A sixth study on Google Ads for 
an algorithmic skin cancer detection app finds that the effectiveness of such 
interventions generalizes to field settings (study 4: N = 14,013).

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to create the preoperative predictive model 
on mediastinal lymph-node metastasis based on artificial intelligence in 
surgically resected lung adenocarcinoma.
METHODS: We enrolled 301 surgical resections of patients with clinical stage 
N0-1 lung adenocarcinoma, who received positron emission tomography 
preoperatively between 2015 and 2019. We randomly assigned the patients into two 
groups: the training (n = 201) and validation groups (n = 100). The training 
group was used to obtain basic data for learning by artificial intelligence, 
whereas the validation group was used to verify the constructed algorithm. We 
used an automatic machine learning platform, to create artificial intelligence 
model. For comparison, multivariate analysis was performed in the training 
group, whereas for calculating and verifying the prediction accuracy rate, 
significant predicting factors were applied to the validation group.
RESULTS: Of the 301 patients, 41 patients were diagnosed as mediastinal lymph 
node metastasis. In multivariate analysis, the maximum standardized uptake value 
was an individual predictive factor. The accuracy rate of artificial 
intelligence model was 84%, and the specificity was 98% which were higher than 
those of the maximum standardized uptake value (61% and 57%). However, in terms 
of sensitivity, artificial intelligence model remarked low at 12%.
CONCLUSIONS: An artificial intelligence-based diagnostic algorithm showed 
remarkable specificity compared with the maximum standardized uptake value. 
Although this model is not ready to practical use and the result was preliminary 
because of poor sensitivity, artificial intelligence could be able to complement 
the shortcomings of existing diagnostic modalities.

BACKGROUND: Because the early diagnosis of subclinical cardiac sarcoidosis (CS) 
remains difficult, we developed a deep learning algorithm to distinguish CS 
patients from healthy subjects using echocardiographic 
movies.Methods and Results:Among the patients who underwent echocardiography 
from January 2015 to December 2019, we chose 151 echocardiographic movies from 
50 CS patients and 151 from 149 healthy subjects. We trained two 3D 
convolutional neural networks (3D-CNN) to identify CS patients using a dataset 
of 212 echocardiographic movies with and without a transfer learning method 
(Pretrained algorithm and Non-pretrained algorithm). On an independent set of 41 
echocardiographic movies, the area under the receiver-operating characteristic 
curve (AUC) of the Pretrained algorithm was greater than that of Non-pretrained 
algorithm (0.842, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.722-0.962 vs. 0.724, 95% CI: 
0.566-0.882, P=0.253). The AUC from the interpretation of the same set of 41 
echocardiographic movies by 5 cardiologists was not significantly different from 
that of the Pretrained algorithm (0.855, 95% CI: 0.735-0.975 vs. 0.842, 95% CI: 
0.722-0.962, P=0.885). A sensitivity map demonstrated that the Pretrained 
algorithm focused on the area of the mitral valve.
CONCLUSIONS: A 3D-CNN with a transfer learning method may be a promising tool 
for detecting CS using an echocardiographic movie.

Conceptual abstraction and analogy-making are key abilities underlying humans' 
abilities to learn, reason, and robustly adapt their knowledge to new domains. 
Despite a long history of research on constructing artificial intelligence (AI) 
systems with these abilities, no current AI system is anywhere close to a 
capability of forming humanlike abstractions or analogies. This paper reviews 
the advantages and limitations of several approaches toward this goal, including 
symbolic methods, deep learning, and probabilistic program induction. The paper 
concludes with several proposals for designing challenge tasks and evaluation 
measures in order to make quantifiable and generalizable progress in this area.

intelligence.

Protein structure refinement is the last step in protein structure prediction 
pipelines. Physics-based refinement via molecular dynamics (MD) simulations has 
made significant progress during recent years. During CASP14, we tested a new 
refinement protocol based on an improved sampling strategy via MD simulations. 
MD simulations were carried out at an elevated temperature (360 K). An optimized 
use of biasing restraints and the use of multiple starting models led to 
enhanced sampling. The new protocol generally improved the model quality. In 
comparison with our previous protocols, the CASP14 protocol showed clear 
improvements. Our approach was successful with most initial models, many based 
on deep learning methods. However, we found that our approach was not able to 
refine machine-learning models from the AlphaFold2 group, often decreasing 
already high initial qualities. To better understand the role of refinement 
given new types of models based on machine-learning, a detailed analysis via MD 
simulations and Markov state modeling is presented here. We continue to find 
that MD-based refinement has the potential to improve AI predictions. We also 
identified several practical issues that make it difficult to realize that 
potential. Increasingly important is the consideration of inter-domain and 
oligomeric contacts in simulations; the presence of large kinetic barriers in 
refinement pathways also continues to present challenges. Finally, we provide a 
perspective on how physics-based refinement could continue to play a role in the 
future for improving initial predictions based on machine learning-based 
methods.

BACKGROUND: Discrimination of nasal cavity mass lesions is a challenging work 
requiring extensive experience. A deep learning-based automated diagnostic 
system may help clinicians to classify nasal cavity mass lesions. We 
demonstrated the feasibility of a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based 
diagnosis system for automatic detection and classification of nasal polyps (NP) 
and inverted papillomas (IP).
METHODS: We developed a CNN-based algorithm using a transfer learning strategy 
and trained it on nasal endoscopic images. A total of 99 nasal endoscopic images 
with normal findings, 98 images with NP, and 100 images with IP were analyzed 
using the developed CNN. Six otolaryngologists participated in clinical visual 
assessment. Image-based classification performance was measured by calculating 
the accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). 
The diagnostic performance was compared between the CNN and clinical visual 
assessment by human experts.
RESULTS: The algorithm achieved an overall accuracy of 0.742 ± 0.058 with the 
following class accuracies: normal, 0.81± 0.14; IP, 0.57 ± 0.07; and NP, 0.83 ± 
0.21. The AUC values for normal, IP, and NP were 0.91 ± 0.06, 0.82 ± 0.09, and 
0.84 ± 0.06, respectively. The overall accuracy of the CNN model was comparable 
with the average performance of human experts (0.742 vs. 0.749; p = 0.11).
CONCLUSIONS: The trained CNN model appears to reliably classify NP and IP of the 
nasal cavity from nasal endoscopic images; it also yields a reliable reference 
for diagnosing nasal cavity mass lesions during nasal endoscopy. However, 
further studies with more test data are warranted to improve the diagnostic 
accuracy of our CNN model.

AIM: To estimate the number of cephalograms needed to re-learn for different 
quality images, when artificial intelligence (AI) systems are introduced in a 
clinic.
SETTINGS AND SAMPLE POPULATION: A total of 2385 digital lateral cephalograms 
(University data [1785]; Clinic F [300]; Clinic N [300]) were used. Using data 
from the university and clinics F and N, and combined data from clinics F and N, 
50 cephalograms were randomly selected to test the system's performance 
(Test-data O, F, N, FN).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: To examine the recognition ability of landmark positions 
of the AI system developed in Part I (Original System) for other clinical data, 
test data F, N and FN were applied to the original system, and success rates 
were calculated. Then, to determine the approximate number of cephalograms 
needed to re-learn for different quality images, 85 and 170 cephalograms were 
randomly selected from each group and used for the re-learning (F85, F170, N85, 
N170, FN85 and FN170) of the original system. To estimate the number of 
cephalograms needed for re-learning, we examined the changes in the success rate 
of the re-trained systems and compared them with the original system. Re-trained 
systems F85 and F170 were evaluated with test data F, N85 and N170 from test 
data N, and FN85 and FN170 from test data FN.
RESULTS: For systems using F, N and FN, it was determined that 85, 170 and 85 
cephalograms, respectively, were required for re-learning.
CONCLUSIONS: The number of cephalograms needed to re-learn for images of 
different quality was estimated.

OBJECTIVES: Bone age is considered an indicator for the diagnosis of precocious 
or delayed puberty and a predictor of adult height. We aimed to evaluate the 
performance of a deep neural network model in assessing rapidly advancing bone 
age during puberty using elbow radiographs.
METHODS: In all, 4437 anteroposterior and lateral pairs of elbow radiographs 
were obtained from pubertal individuals from two institutions to implement and 
validate a deep neural network model. The reference standard bone age was 
established by five trained researchers using the Sauvegrain method, a scoring 
system based on the shapes of the lateral condyle, trochlea, olecranon 
apophysis, and proximal radial epiphysis. A test set (n = 141) was obtained from 
an external institution. The differences between the assessment of the model and 
that of reviewers were compared.
RESULTS: The mean absolute difference (MAD) in bone age estimation between the 
model and reviewers was 0.15 years on internal validation. In the test set, the 
MAD between the model and the five experts ranged from 0.19 to 0.30 years. 
Compared with the reference standard, the MAD was 0.22 years. Interobserver 
agreement was excellent among reviewers (ICC: 0.99) and between the model and 
the reviewers (ICC: 0.98). In the subpart analysis, the olecranon apophysis 
exhibited the highest accuracy (74.5%), followed by the trochlea (73.7%), 
lateral condyle (73.7%), and radial epiphysis (63.1%).
CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of rapidly advancing bone age during puberty on elbow 
radiographs using our deep neural network model was similar to that of experts.
KEY POINTS: • Bone age during puberty is particularly important for patients 
with scoliosis or limb-length discrepancy to determine the phase of the disease, 
which influences the timing and method of surgery. • The commonly used hand 
radiographs-based methods have limitations in assessing bone age during puberty 
due to the less prominent morphological changes of the hand and wrist bones in 
this period. • A deep neural network model trained with elbow radiographs 
exhibited similar performance to human experts on estimating rapidly advancing 
bone age during puberty.

The failure of animal studies to translate to effective clinical therapeutics 
has driven efforts to identify underlying cause and develop solutions that 
improve the reproducibility and translatability of preclinical research. Common 
issues revolve around study design, analysis, and reporting as well as 
standardization between preclinical and clinical endpoints. To address these 
needs, recent advancements in digital technology, including biomonitoring of 
digital biomarkers, development of software systems and database technologies, 
as well as application of artificial intelligence to preclinical datasets can be 
used to increase the translational relevance of preclinical animal research. In 
this review, we will describe how a number of innovative digital technologies 
are being applied to overcome recurring challenges in study design, execution, 
and data sharing as well as improving scientific outcome measures. Examples of 
how these technologies are applied to specific therapeutic areas are provided. 
Digital technologies can enhance the quality of preclinical research and 
encourage scientific collaboration, thus accelerating the development of novel 
therapeutics.

OBJECTIVE: Assess if deep learning-based artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm 
improves reader performance for lung cancer detection on chest X-rays (CXRs).
METHODS: This reader study included 173 images from cancer-positive patients (n 
= 98) and 346 images from cancer-negative patients (n = 196) selected from 
National Lung Screening Trial (NLST). Eight readers, including three radiology 
residents, and five board-certified radiologists, participated in the observer 
performance test. AI algorithm provided image-level probability of pulmonary 
nodule or mass on CXRs and a heatmap of detected lesions. Reader performance was 
compared with AUC, sensitivity, specificity, false-positives per image (FPPI), 
and rates of chest CT recommendations.
RESULTS: With AI, the average sensitivity of readers for the detection of 
visible lung cancer increased for residents, but was similar for radiologists 
compared to that without AI (0.61 [95% CI, 0.55-0.67] vs. 0.72 [95% CI, 
0.66-0.77], p = 0.016 for residents, and 0.76 [95% CI, 0.72-0.81] vs. 0.76 [95% 
CI, 0.72-0.81, p = 1.00 for radiologists), while false-positive findings per 
image (FPPI) was similar for residents, but decreased for radiologists (0.15 
[95% CI, 0.11-0.18] vs. 0.12 [95% CI, 0.09-0.16], p = 0.13 for residents, and 
0.24 [95% CI, 0.20-0.29] vs. 0.17 [95% CI, 0.13-0.20], p < 0.001 for 
radiologists). With AI, the average rate of chest CT recommendation in patients 
positive for visible cancer increased for residents, but was similar for 
radiologists (54.7% [95% CI, 48.2-61.2%] vs. 70.2% [95% CI, 64.2-76.2%], p < 
0.001 for residents and 72.5% [95% CI, 68.0-77.1%] vs. 73.9% [95% CI, 
69.4-78.3%], p = 0.68 for radiologists), while that in cancer-negative patients 
was similar for residents, but decreased for radiologists (11.2% [95% CI, 
9.6-13.1%] vs. 9.8% [95% CI, 8.0-11.6%], p = 0.32 for residents and 16.4% [95% 
CI, 14.7-18.2%] vs. 11.7% [95% CI, 10.2-13.3%], p < 0.001 for radiologists).
CONCLUSIONS: AI algorithm can enhance the performance of readers for the 
detection of lung cancers on chest radiographs when used as second reader.
KEY POINTS: • Reader study in the NLST dataset shows that AI algorithm had 
sensitivity benefit for residents and specificity benefit for radiologists for 
the detection of visible lung cancer. • With AI, radiology residents were able 
to recommend more chest CT examinations (54.7% vs 70.2%, p < 0.001) for patients 
with visible lung cancer. • With AI, radiologists recommended significantly less 
proportion of unnecessary chest CT examinations (16.4% vs. 11.7%, p < 0.001) in 
cancer-negative patients.

Dentistry increasingly integrates artificial intelligence (AI) to help improve 
the current state of clinical dental practice. However, this revolutionary 
technological field raises various complex ethical challenges. The objective of 
this systematic scoping review is to document the current uses of AI in 
dentistry and the ethical concerns or challenges they imply. Three health care 
databases (MEDLINE [PubMed], SciVerse Scopus, and Cochrane Library) and 2 
computer science databases (ArXiv, IEEE Xplore) were searched. After identifying 
1,553 records, the documents were filtered, and a full-text screening was 
performed. In total, 178 studies were retained and analyzed by 8 researchers 
specialized in dentistry, AI, and ethics. The team used Covidence for data 
extraction and Dedoose for the identification of ethics-related information. 
PRISMA guidelines were followed. Among the included studies, 130 (73.0%) studies 
were published after 2016, and 93 (52.2%) were published in journals specialized 
in computer sciences. The technologies used were neural learning techniques for 
75 (42.1%), traditional learning techniques for 76 (42.7%), or a combination of 
several technologies for 20 (11.2%). Overall, 7 countries contributed to 109 
(61.2%) studies. A total of 53 different applications of AI in dentistry were 
identified, involving most dental specialties. The use of initial data sets for 
internal validation was reported in 152 (85.4%) studies. Forty-five ethical 
issues (related to the use AI in dentistry) were reported in 22 (12.4%) studies 
around 6 principles: prudence (10 times), equity (8), privacy (8), 
responsibility (6), democratic participation (4), and solidarity (4). The ratio 
of studies mentioning AI-related ethical issues has remained similar in the past 
years, showing that there is no increasing interest in the field of dentistry on 
this topic. This study confirms the growing presence of AI in dentistry and 
highlights a current lack of information on the ethical challenges surrounding 
its use. In addition, the scarcity of studies sharing their code could prevent 
future replications. The authors formulate recommendations to contribute to a 
more responsible use of AI technologies in dentistry.

As more bioactivity and protein structure data become available, scoring 
functions (SFs) using machine learning (ML) to leverage these data sets continue 
to gain further accuracy and broader applicability. Advances in our 
understanding of the optimal ways to train and evaluate these ML-based SFs have 
introduced further improvements. One of these advances is how to select the most 
suitable decoys (molecules assumed inactive) to train or test an ML-based SF on 
a given target. We also review the latest applications of ML-based SFs for 
prospective structure-based virtual screening (SBVS), with a focus on the 
observed improvement over those using classical SFs. Finally, we provide 
recommendations for future prospective SBVS studies based on the findings of 
recent methodological studies.

BACKGROUND: Coding has been added to school curricula in several countries, 
being one of the necessary competencies of the 21st century. Although it has 
also been suggested to foster the development of several cognitive skills such 
as computational thinking and problem-solving, studies on the effects of coding 
are very limited, provide mixed results, and lack causal evidence.
AIM: This study aims to evaluate the impact of a learn-to-code programme on 
three cognitive skills in children: computational thinking, fluid intelligence, 
and spatial orientation, using a randomized trial.
SAMPLE: One hundred seventy-four (n = 81 girls) 4th-grade children participated 
in the study.
METHODS: Children were randomly assigned to one of the three 10-week learning 
programmes: learn-to-code (treatment of interest), mathematics (another 
STEM-related comparison treatment), and reading (control). Children responded to 
paper-pencil computational thinking, and spatial orientation measurements, and 
face-to-face matrix reasoning task at pre- and post-tests.
RESULTS: Results showed that children's computational thinking scores increased 
significantly only in the learn-to-code condition. Fluid intelligence 
significantly increased in all conditions, possibly due to a practice effect. 
The spatial orientation did not improve in any of the conditions.
CONCLUSION: These findings suggested that learning to code can be selectively

AIM: The use of artificial intelligence represents an objective approach to 
increase endoscopist's adenoma detection rate (ADR) and limit interoperator 
variability. In this study, we evaluated a newly developed deep convolutional 
neural network (DCNN) for automated detection of colorectal polyps ex vivo as 
well as in a first in-human trial.
METHODS: For training of the DCNN, 116 529 colonoscopy images from 278 patients 
with 788 different polyps were collected. A subset of 10 467 images containing 
504 different polyps were manually annotated and treated as the gold standard. 
An independent set of 45 videos consisting of 15 534 single frames was used for 
ex vivo performance testing. In vivo real-time detection of colorectal polyps 
during routine colonoscopy by the DCNN was tested in 42 patients in a 
back-to-back approach.
RESULTS: When analyzing the test set of 15 534 single frames, the DCNN's 
sensitivity and specificity for polyp detection and localization within the 
frame was 90% and 80%, respectively, with an area under the curve of 0.92. In 
vivo, baseline polyp detection rate and ADR were 38% and 26% and significantly 
increased to 50% (P = 0.023) and 36% (P = 0.044), respectively, with the use of 
the DCNN. Of the 13 additionally with the DCNN detected lesions, the majority 
were diminutive and flat, among them three sessile serrated adenomas.
CONCLUSION: This newly developed DCNN enables highly sensitive automated 
detection of colorectal polyps both ex vivo and during first in-human clinical 
testing and could potentially increase the detection of colorectal polyps during 
colonoscopy.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the robustness of the published machine learning models in 
the prediction of extraction vs non-extraction for a diverse US sample 
population seen by multiple providers.
SETTING AND SAMPLE POPULATION: Diverse group of 838 patients (208 extraction, 
630 non-extraction) were consecutively enrolled.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two sets of input features (117 and 22) including 
clinical and cephalometric variables were identified based on previous studies. 
Random forest (RF) and multilayer perception (MLP) models were trained using 
these feature sets on the sample population and evaluated using measures 
including accuracy (ACC) and balanced accuracy (BA). A technique to identify 
incongruent data was used to explore underlying characteristics of the data set 
and split all samples into 2 groups (G1 and G2) for further model training.
RESULTS: Performance of the models (75%-79% ACC and 72%-76% BA) on the total 
sample population was lower than in previous research. Models were retrained and 
evaluated using G1 and G2 separately, and individual group MLP models yielded 
improved accuracy for G1 (96% ACC and 94% BA) and G2 (88% ACC and 85% BA). RF 
feature ranking showed differences between top features for G1 (maxillary 
crowding, mandibular crowding and L1-NB) and G2 (age, mandibular crowding and 
lower lip to E-plane).
CONCLUSIONS: An incongruent data pattern exists in a consecutively enrolled 
patient population. Future work with incongruent data segregation and advanced 
artificial intelligence algorithms is needed to improve the generalization 
ability to make it ready to support clinical decision-making.

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether AI systems that recognize cephalometric 
landmarks can apply to various patient groups and to examine the patient-related 
factors associated with identification errors.
SETTING AND SAMPLE POPULATION: The present retrospective cohort study analysed 
digital lateral cephalograms obtained from 1785 Japanese orthodontic patients. 
Patients were categorized into eight subgroups according to dental age, cleft 
lip and/or palate, orthodontic appliance use and overjet.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: An AI system that automatically recognizes anatomic 
landmarks on lateral cephalograms was used. Thirty cephalograms in each subgroup 
were randomly selected and used to test the system's performance. The remaining 
cephalograms were used for system learning. The success rates in landmark 
recognition were evaluated using confidence ellipses with α = 0.99 for each 
landmark. The selection of test samples, learning of the system and evaluation 
of the system were repeated five times for each subgroup. The mean success rate 
and identification error were calculated. Factors associated with identification 
errors were examined using a multiple linear regression model.
RESULTS: The success rate and error varied among subgroups, ranging from 85% to 
91% and 1.32 mm to 1.50 mm, respectively. Cleft lip and/or palate was found to 
be a factor associated with greater identification errors, whereas dental age, 
orthodontic appliances and overjet were not significant factors (all, P < .05).
CONCLUSION: Artificial intelligence systems that recognize cephalometric 
landmarks could be applied to various patient groups. Patient-oriented errors 
were found in patients with cleft lip and/or palate.

BACKGROUND: Creativity is linked with educationally relevant constructs such as 
achievement, intelligence, and motivation. However, very few studies have 
explored longitudinal links between the constructs or the aetiology of 
individual differences in childhood creativity.
AIMS: The study addresses the gap in the literature of developmental studies on 
the relationship of creativity with other educationally relevant measures. 
Additionally, the present study is the first adequately powered genetically 
informative analysis of childhood creativity.
SAMPLE(S): The present study utilized data from 1,306 twins, a subsample from a 
longitudinal, representative twin sample in the UK.
METHODS: Creativity was operationalised as a Creative Expressiveness score, 
using the Consensual Assessment Technique on stories written by 9-year-olds. 
Intelligence and writing motivation were assessed at age 9. Academic achievement 
was collected at ages 9, 12, and 16.
RESULTS: Creative Expressiveness was associated with intelligence and 
motivation, all measured at age 9. It also predicted variance in English grades 
at ages 9 and 16. The associations were weak, but significant, over and above 
intelligence, motivation, and earlier English grades. The variance in Creative 
Expressiveness was explained by genetic (35%), shared environmental (21%), and 
non-shared environmental (45%) influences. The phenotypic correlations with 
other study variables were mainly mediated genetically.
CONCLUSIONS: The results provide information that can be used for planning 
educational content. First, creativity can be detected in childhood writing. 
Second, childhood creativity may be overlooked in early educational assessments. 
Third, the results from the genetic analyses are important indications on the 
role of environments in the development of creativity.

Artificial intelligence developments are essential to the successful deployment 
of community-wide, MRI-driven prostate cancer diagnosis. AI systems should 
ensure that the main benefits of biopsy avoidance are delivered while 
maintaining consistent high specificities, at a range of disease prevalences. 
Since all current artificial intelligence / computer-aided detection systems for 
prostate cancer detection are experimental, multiple developmental efforts are 
still needed to bring the vision to fruition. Initial work needs to focus on 
developing systems as diagnostic supporting aids so their results can be 
integrated into the radiologists' workflow including gland and target outlining 
tasks for fusion biopsies. Developing AI systems as clinical decision-making 
tools will require greater efforts. The latter encompass larger multicentric, 
multivendor datasets where the different needs of patients stratified by 
diagnostic settings, disease prevalence, patient preference, and clinical 
setting are considered. AI-based, robust, standard operating procedures will 
increase the confidence of patients and payers, thus enabling the wider adoption 
of the MRI-directed approach for prostate cancer diagnosis. KEY POINTS: • AI 
systems need to ensure that the benefits of biopsy avoidance are delivered with 
consistent high specificities, at a range of disease prevalence. • Initial work 
has focused on developing systems as diagnostic supporting aids for outlining 
tasks, so they can be integrated into the radiologists' workflow to support 
MRI-directed biopsies. • Decision support tools require a larger body of work 
including multicentric, multivendor studies where the clinical needs, disease 
prevalence, patient preferences, and clinical setting are additionally defined.

Pain is a complex experience that involves sensation, emotion, and cognition. 
The subjectivity of the traditional pain measurement tools has expedited the 
interest in developing neuroimaging techniques to monitor pain objectively. 
Among noninvasive neuroimaging techniques, functional near-infrared spectroscopy 
(fNIRS) has balanced spatial and temporal resolution; yet, it is portable, 
quiet, and cost-effective. These features enable fNIRS to image the cortical 
mechanisms of pain in a clinical environment. In this article, we evaluated pain 
neuroimaging studies that used the fNIRS technique in the past decade. Starting 
from the experimental design, we reviewed the regions of interest, probe 
localization, data processing, and primary findings of these existing fNIRS 
studies. We also discussed the fNIRS imaging's potential as a brain surveillance 
technique for pain, in combination with artificial intelligence and extended 
reality techniques. We concluded that fNIRS is a brain imaging technique with 
great potential for objective pain assessment in the clinical environment.

BACKGROUND: Although deep learning algorithms for clinical cytology have 
recently been developed, their application to practical assistance systems has 
not been achieved. In addition, whether deep learning systems (DLSs) can perform 
diagnoses that cannot be performed by pathologists has not been fully evaluated.
METHODS: The authors initially obtained low-power field cytology images from 
archived Papanicolaou-stained urinary cytology glass slides from 232 patients. 
To aid in the development of a diagnosis support system that could identify 
suspicious atypical cells, the images were divided into high-power field panel 
image sets for training and testing of the 16-layer Visual Geometry Group 
convolutional neural network. The DLS was trained using linked information 
pertaining to whether urothelial carcinoma (UC) in the corresponding histology 
specimen was invasive or noninvasive, or high-grade or low-grade, followed by an 
evaluation of whether the DLS could diagnose these characteristics.
RESULTS: The DLS achieved excellent performance (eg, an area under the curve 
[AUC] of 0.9890; F1 score, 0.9002) when trained on high-power field images of 
malignant and benign cases. The DLS could diagnose whether the lesions were 
invasive UC (AUC, 0.8628; F1 score, 0.8239) or high-grade UC (AUC, 0.8661; F1 
score, 0.8218). Gradient-weighted class activation mapping of these images 
indicated that the diagnoses were based on the color of tumor cell nuclei.
CONCLUSIONS: The DLS could accurately screen UC cells and determine the 
malignant potential of tumors more accurately than classical cytology. The use 
of a DLS during cytopathology screening could help urologists plan therapeutic 
strategies, which, in turn, may be beneficial for patients.

Gender blindness: On health and welfare technology, AI and gender equality in 
community care.

Frennert S(1).

Author information:

People Research Center, Malmö University, Malmö, Sweden.

Digital health and welfare technologies and artificial intelligence are proposed 
to revolutionise healthcare systems around the world by enabling new models of 
care. Digital health and welfare technologies enable remote monitoring and 
treatments, and artificial intelligence is proposed as a means of prediction 
instead of reaction to individuals' health and as an enabler of proactive care 
and rehabilitation. The digital transformation not only affects hospital and 
primary care but also how the community meets older people's needs. Community 
care is often provided by informal and formal care-givers, most of whom are 
women. Gender equality is at the heart of many national strategies, but do all 
genders have equal rights, responsibilities and opportunities when it comes to 
community care and its digital transformation? The digital transformation of 
community care is entangled with how care is provided to older people and the 
working conditions of community-care professionals. Current and, even more so, 
future community-care systems are and will be partly constituted by networks of 
technological artefacts. These health and welfare technological artefacts and 
the discourse surrounding them mediate and constitute social relations and 
community care. This article looks into how health and welfare technology and 
artificial intelligence-based devices and systems mediate and constitute gender 
relations in community care and presents an argument for reflexivity, 
embodiment, pluralism, participation and ecology as an alternative strategy to 
treating community care as one-size-fit-all and being blind to gender-related 
issues.

Advancements in technology and data collection generated immense amounts of 
information from various sources such as health records, clinical examination, 
imaging, medical devices, as well as experimental and biological data. Proper 
management and analysis of these data via high-end computing solutions, 
artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches can assist in extracting 
meaningful information that enhances population health and well-being. 
Furthermore, the extracted knowledge can provide new avenues for modern 
healthcare delivery via clinical decision support systems. This manuscript 
presents a narrative review of data science approaches for clinical decision 
support systems in orthodontics. We describe the fundamental components of data 
science approaches including (a) Data collection, storage and management; (b) 
Data processing; (c) In-depth data analysis; and (d) Data communication. Then, 
we introduce a web-based data management platform, the Data Storage for 
Computation and Integration, for temporomandibular joint and dental clinical 
decision support systems.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the accuracy of automated identification of 
cephalometric landmarks using the cascade convolutional neural networks (CNN) on 
lateral cephalograms acquired from nationwide multi-centres.
SETTINGS AND SAMPLE POPULATION: A total of 3150 lateral cephalograms were 
acquired from 10 university hospitals in South Korea for training.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated the accuracy of the developed model with 
independent 100 lateral cephalograms as an external validation. Two 
orthodontists independently identified the anatomic landmarks of the test data 
set using the V-ceph software (version 8.0, Osstem, Seoul, Korea). The mean 
positions of the landmarks identified by two orthodontists were regarded as the 
gold standard. The performance of the CNN model was evaluated by calculating the 
mean absolute distance between the gold standard and the automatically detected 
positions. Factors associated with the detection accuracy for landmarks were 
analysed using the linear regression models.
RESULTS: The mean inter-examiner difference was 1.31 ± 1.13 mm. The overall 
automated detection error was 1.36 ± 0.98 mm. The mean detection error for each 
landmark ranged between 0.46 ± 0.37 mm (maxillary incisor crown tip) and 
2.09 ± 1.91 mm (distal root tip of the mandibular first molar). A significant 
difference in the detection accuracy among cephalograms was noted according to 
hospital (P = .011), sensor type (P < .01), and cephalography machine model 
(P < .01).
CONCLUSION: The automated cephalometric landmark detection model may aid in 
preliminary screening for patient diagnosis and mid-treatment assessment, 
independent of the type of the radiography machines tested.

The second half of the last century was characterized by intense research in the 
field of arterial hypertension and related therapies. These studies showed that 
the management of arterial hypertension requires a robust coordination with 
close integration of the "health care systems" and "health care professionals." 
In 1998, the healthcare organization named "Campania Salute Network" was set up 
at the Federico II University, Naples, Italy. The Campania Salute Network 
involves 23 outpatient hypertensive clinics distributed in different community 
hospitals of the Regione Campania's area, 60 randomly selected general 
practitioners uniformly distributed in the same area, and the Hypertension 
Clinic of the Federico II University (coordinating center). Through this 
network, clinical data collected at each visit are shared (via text messages or 
e-mails) with peripheral units (general practitioners and community hospital 
outpatient hypertensive clinics). The coordinating centre works in cooperation 
with the peripheral units in the treatment and follow-up of all hypertensive 
patients (i.e. assessing hypertension mediated organ damage and associated 
diseases). Information about patients are shared through on-line access to the 
remote web-based database. The integrated approach to the mamangement of 
hyperetension determined a better control of blood pressure, that was associated 
with a reduction of hypertension mediated organ damage and decreased incidence 
of fatal or non-fatal cardiovascular events. Furthermore, this innovative 
approach improved the adherence and the persistence to the initial pharmacologic 
treatment. Campania Salute Network is also a powerful tool for the clinical and 
translational research with more 15,000 hypertensive patients followed for more 
than 15 years. This database allowed, in prospetic, large scale studies, to 
identify the hemodiminamic and metabolic determinants of hypertension mediated 
organ damage and major cardiovascular events. The experience of Campania Salute 
Netwiork indicates that the creation of large databases from real life 
experiences becomes an indispensable condition also for artificial intelligence 
which, in the near future, thanks to scientific knowledge, the availability of 
particularly advanced hardware and software, will also be able to transform the 
management of arterial hypertension.

BACKGROUND: Acute Kidney Injury (AKI), a frequent complication of pateints in 
the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), is associated with a high mortality rate. Early 
prediction of AKI is essential in order to trigger the use of preventive 
care actions.
METHODS: The aim of this study was to ascertain the accuracy of two mathematical 
analysis models in obtaining a predictive score for AKI development. A deep 
learning model based on a urine output trends was compared with a logistic 
regression analysis for AKI prediction in stages 2 and 3 (defined as the 
simultaneous increase of serum creatinine and decrease of urine output, 
according to  the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) guidelines). Two 
retrospective datasets including 35,573 ICU patients were analyzed. Urine output 
data were used to train and test the logistic regression and the deep learning 
model.
RESULTS: The deep learning model defined an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.89 
(± 0.01), sensitivity = 0.8 and specificity = 0.84, which was higher than the 
logistic regression analysis. The deep learning model was able to predict 88% of 
AKI cases more than 12 h before their onset: for every 6 patients identified as 
being at risk of AKI by the deep learning model, 5 experienced the event. On the 
contrary, for every 12 patients not considered to be at risk by the model, 2 
developed AKI.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, by using urine output trends, deep learning analysis 
was able to predict AKI episodes more than 12 h in advance, and with a higher 
accuracy than the classical urine output thresholds. We suggest that this 
algorithm could be integrated in the ICU setting to better manage, and 
potentially prevent, AKI episodes.

OBJECTIVE: Over the last two decades, Western society has undergone a marked 
cultural transformation characterized by rising individualism. Concurrently, the 
digital landscape has transformed through the rise of social media and 
smartphones. These factors have previously been implicated in changing 
individuals' attitudes, behavior, and interpersonal interactions. We 
investigated whether these societal changes have coincided with changes in trait 
emotional intelligence (EI) over the last 17 years in Western university 
students.
METHOD: We examined this question using a cross-temporal meta-analysis (k = 70; 
N = 16,917).
RESULTS: There was no change in overall trait EI; however, the trait EI domains 
"well-being," "self-control," and "emotionality" demonstrated significant 
decreases with time, after controlling for gender composition and 
between-country differences.
CONCLUSION: We discuss these findings in relation to how they contribute to our 
understanding of trait EI, and how they add to the literature on how Western 
society is changing with time.

INTRODUCTION: There is increased interest in the use of artificial 
intelligence-based (AI) software packages in the evaluation of neuroimaging 
studies for acute ischemic stroke. We studied whether, compared to standard 
image interpretation without AI, Brainomix e-ASPECTS software improved 
interobserver agreement and accuracy in detecting ASPECTS regions affected in 
anterior circulation LVO.
METHODS: We included 60 consecutive patients with anterior circulation LVO who 
had TICI 3 revascularization within 60 minutes of their baseline CT. A total of 
16 readers, including senior neuroradiologists, junior neuroradiologists and 
vascular neurologists participated. Readers interpreted CT scans on independent 
workstations and assessed final ASPECTS and evaluated whether each individual 
ASPECTS region was affected. Two months later, readers again evaluated the CT 
scans, but with assistance of e-ASPECTS software. We assessed interclass 
correlation coefficient for total ASPECTS and interobserver agreement with 
Fleiss' Kappa for each ASPECTS region with and without assistance of the 
e-ASPECTS. We also assessed accuracy for the readers with and without e-ASPECTS 
assistance. In our assessment of accuracy, ground truth was the 24 hour CT in 
this cohort of patients who had prompt and complete revascularization.
RESULTS: Interclass correlation coefficient for total ASPECTS without e-ASPECTS 
assistance was 0.395, indicating fair agreement compared, to 0.574 with 
e-ASPECTS assistance, indicating good agreement (P < 0.01). There was 
significant improvement in inter-rater agreement with e-ASPECTS assistance for 
each individual region with the exception of M6 and caudate. The e-ASPECTS 
software had higher accuracy than the overall cohort of readers (with and 
without e-ASPECTS assistance) for every region except the caudate.
CONCLUSIONS: Use of Brainomix e-ASPECTS software resulted in significant 
improvements in inter-rater agreement and accuracy of ASPECTS score evaluation 
in a large group of neuroradiologists and neurologists. e-ASPECTS software was 
more predictive of final infarct/ASPECTS than the overall group interpreting the 
CT scans with and without e-ASPECTS assistance.

BACKGROUND: Many children born with congenital heart defects are faced with 
cognitive deficits and psychological challenges later in life. The mechanisms 
behind are suggested to be multifactorial and are explained as an interplay 
between innate and modifiable risk factors. The aim was to assess whether there 
is a relationship between mean arterial pressure during surgery of a septal 
defect in infancy or early childhood and intelligence quotient scores in 
adulthood.
METHODS: In a retrospective study, patients were included if they underwent 
surgical closure of a ventricular septal defect or an atrial septal defect in 
childhood between 1988 and 2002. Every patient completed an intelligence 
assessment upon inclusion, 14-27 years after surgery, using the Wechsler Adult 
Intelligence Scale Version IV.
RESULTS: A total of 58 patients met the eligibility criteria and were included 
in the analyses. No statistically significant correlation was found between 
blood pressure during cardiopulmonary bypass and intelligence quotient scores in 
adulthood (r = 0.138; 95% CI-0.133-0.389). Although amongst patients with mean 
arterial pressure < 40 mmHg during cardiopulmonary bypass, intelligence quotient 
scores were significantly lower (91.4; 95% CI 86.9-95.9) compared to those with 
mean arterial pressure > 40 mmHg (99.8; 95% CI 94.7-104.9).
CONCLUSIONS: Mean arterial pressure during surgery of ventricular septal defects 
or atrial septal defects in childhood does not correlate linearly with 
intelligence quotient scores in adulthood. Although there may exist a specific 
cut-off value at which low blood pressure becomes harmful. Larger studies are 
warranted in order to confirm this, as it holds the potential of partly 
relieving CHD patients of their cognitive deficits.

BACKGROUND: The recognition of child physical abuse can be challenging and often 
requires a multidisciplinary assessment. Deep learning models, based on clinical 
characteristics, laboratory studies, and imaging findings, were developed to 
facilitate unbiased identification of children who may have been abused.
METHODS: Level 1 pediatric trauma center registry data from 1/1/2010-1/31/2020 
were queried for abused children and matched participants with non-abusive 
trauma. Observations were de-identified and divided into training and validation 
sets. Model 1 used patient demographics (age, gender, and insurance type) and 
clinical characteristics (vital signs, shock index pediatric age-adjusted, 
Glasgow Coma Score, lactate, base deficit, and international normalized ratio). 
Model 2 used the same features as Model 1, but with the text of the radiology 
reports of head computed tomography, brain MRIs, and skeletal surveys. Google's 
latest BERT Natural Language Processing (NLP) model, which was pre-trained on a 
large corpus, was used for fine-tuning Model 2. Accuracy, sensitivity, 
specificity, F1 scores, and positive predictive values were used to assess 
performance.
RESULTS: Of 1,312 patients, 737 (56.2%) were abused. Model 1 had an accuracy of 
86.3%, sensitivity of 87.2%, specificity of 85.1%, F1 score of 0.86, and 
positive predictive value (PPV) of 88.7% for the validation set with an area 
under the receiver Operating Curve (ROC AUC) of 0.86. NLP based Model 2 had an 
accuracy of 93.4%, sensitivity 92.5%, specificity of 94.6%, F1 score of 0.93, 
and PPV of 95.9% for the validation set, with a ROC AUC of 0.94. Most features 
had weak individual correlations with abuse (r < 0.3).
CONCLUSIONS: Deep learning models accurately distinguished child physical abuse 
from non-abuse, and NLP further improved the accuracy of the models. Such models 
could be developed to run in real-time in the electronic medical record and 
alert clinicians when certain criteria are met, which would prompt them to 
pursue the diagnosis of abuse.

CONTEXT: Identifying the most effective first-line treatment for metastatic 
renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) is challenging as rapidly evolving data quickly 
outdate the existing body of evidence, and current approaches to presenting the 
evidence in user-friendly formats are fraught with limitations.
OBJECTIVE: To maintain living evidence for contemporary first-line treatment for 
previously untreated mRCC.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We have created a living, interactive systematic review 
(LISR) and network meta-analysis for first-line treatment of mRCC using data 
from randomized controlled trials comparing contemporary treatment options with 
single-agent tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We applied an advanced programming and 
artificial intelligence-assisted framework for evidence synthesis to create a 
living search strategy, facilitate screening and data extraction using a 
graphical user interface, automate the frequentist network meta-analysis, and 
display results in an interactive manner.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: As of October 22, 2020, the LISR includes data from 14 
clinical trials. Baseline characteristics are summarized in an interactive 
table. The cabozantinib + nivolumab combination (CaboNivo) is ranked the highest 
for the overall response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival, 
whereas ipilimumab + nivolumab (NivoIpi) is ranked the highest for achieving a 
complete response (CR). NivoIpi, and atezolizumab + bevacizumab (AteBev) were 
ranked highest (lowest toxicity) and CaboNivo ranked lowest for 
treatment-related adverse events (AEs). Network meta-analysis results are 
summarized as interactive tables and plots, GRADE summary-of-findings tables, 
and evidence maps.
CONCLUSIONS: This innovative living and interactive review provides the best 
current evidence on the comparative effectiveness of multiple treatment options 
for patients with untreated mRCC. Trial-level comparisons suggest that CaboNivo 
is likely to cause more AEs but is ranked best for all efficacy outcomes, except 
NivoIpi offers the best chance of CR. Pembrolizumab + axitinib and NivoIpi are 
acceptable alternatives, except NivoIpi may not be preferred for patients with 
favorable risk. Although network meta-analysis provides rankings with 
statistical adjustments, there are inherent biases in cross-trial comparisons 
with sparse direct evidence that does not replace randomized comparisons.
PATIENT SUMMARY: It is challenging to decide the best option among the several 
treatment combinations of immunotherapy and targeted treatments for newly 
diagnosed metastatic kidney cancer. We have created interactive evidence 
summaries of multiple treatment options that present the benefits and harms and 
evidence certainty for patient-important outcomes. This evidence is updated as 
soon as new studies are published.

Mechanoluminescence Rebrightening the Prospects of Stress Sensing: A Review.

Zhuang Y(1), Xie RJ(1).

Author information:

Genome, Xiamen University, Xiamen, 361005, China.

The emergence of new applications, such as in artificial intelligence, the 
internet of things, and biotechnology, has driven the evolution of stress 
sensing technology. For these emerging applications, stretchability, remoteness, 
stress distribution, a multimodal nature, and biocompatibility are important 
performance characteristics of stress sensors. Mechanoluminescence (ML)-based 
stress sensing has attracted widespread attention because of its characteristics 
of remoteness and having a distributed response to mechanical stimuli as well as 
its great potential for stretchability, biocompatibility, and self-powering. In 
the past few decades, great progress has been made in the discovery of ML 
materials, analysis of mechanisms, design of devices, and exploration of 
applications. One can find that with this progress, the focus of ML research has 
shifted from the phenomenon in the earliest stage to materials and recently 
toward devices. At the present stage, while showing great prospects for advanced 
stress sensing applications, ML-based sensing still faces major challenges in 
material optimization, device design, and system integration.

For years, a discussion has persevered on the benefits and drawbacks of antibody 
discovery using animal immunization versus in vitro selection from 
non-animal-derived recombinant repertoires using display technologies. While it 
has been argued that using recombinant display libraries can reduce animal 
consumption, we hold that the number of animals used in immunization campaigns 
is dwarfed by the number sacrificed during preclinical studies. Thus, improving 
quality control of antibodies before entering in vivo studies will have a larger 
impact on animal consumption. Both animal immunization and recombinant 
repertoires present unique advantages for discovering antibodies that are fit 
for purpose. Furthermore, we anticipate that machine learning will play a 
significant role within discovery workflows, refining current antibody discovery 
practices.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review was to map what is known about nurse 
manager emotional intelligence in relation to nurse job satisfaction and 
retention, and the tools used to measure emotional intelligence in this context.
INTRODUCTION: As the health care environment responds to the demands of 
high-quality and low-cost care, nurse managers must ensure that patient care 
environments are safe, efficient, and effective. Understanding nurse manager 
emotional intelligence may help organizations improve nurse satisfaction and 
retention as a strategy for reducing costs.
INCLUSION CRITERIA: This review considered experimental and quasi-experimental 
study designs, analytical observational studies, descriptive observational 
studies, systematic reviews and meta-analyses, qualitative studies, and text and 
opinion papers. Studies with staff nurses and experiences working with nurse 
managers were included. Studies that examined emotional intelligence of nurse 
managers, in any context, related to staff job satisfaction and retention in 
nursing and/or that discussed tools used to measure nurse managers' emotional 
intelligence were considered for inclusion.
METHODS: This review followed JBI methodology for scoping reviews. Key 
information sources searched included CINAHL (EBSCO), Health and Psychosocial 
Instruments (EBSCO), Scopus (Elsevier), EBSCO Health Source (EBSCO), JBI

Studies published in English from 1995 to September 2019 were included in the 
review. Two independent reviewers assessed titles and abstracts against the 
inclusion criteria. Studies that met the inclusion criteria were retrieved in 
full and assessed in detail. The data extraction tool was developed by the 
authors to examine information retrieved.
RESULTS: Eight quantitative studies were included, all from the United States. 
The studies included 232 nurse manager participants and 3731 staff nurse 
participants from academic and non-academic hospitals. Seven of the eight 
studies used the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test to measure 
nurse manager emotional intelligence, and one study used the Emotional Quotient 
Inventory 2.0. Of the eight included studies, six studies showed no significant 
relationship between emotional intelligence and nurse job satisfaction and/or 
retention, one revealed a positive correlation, and one revealed both positive 
and negative correlations.
CONCLUSIONS: Limited research exists to determine whether nurse manager 
emotional intelligence plays a role in staff nurse job satisfaction and/or 
retention. All studies reported a need for further research, as well as the use 
of differing methodologies and a more diverse nursing population. This review 
may raise awareness among nurse managers as well as health care organizations 
about understanding and developing emotional intelligence.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the agreement between artificial intelligence software 
(AI) and radiographers in assessing breast positioning criteria for mammograms 
from standard digital mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis.
METHODS: Assessment of breast positioning was performed by AI and by four 
radiographers in pairs of two on 156 examinations of women screened in Bergen, 
April to September 2019, as part of BreastScreen Norway. Ten criteria were used; 
three for craniocaudal and seven for mediolateral-oblique view. The criteria 
evaluated the appearance of the nipple, breast rotation, pectoral muscle, 
inframammary fold and pectoral nipple line. Intraclass correlation and Cohen's 
kappa coefficient (κ) were used to investigate the correlation and agreement 
between the radiographer's assessments and AI.
RESULTS: The intraclass correlation for the pectoral nipple line between the 
radiographers and AI was >0.92. A substantial to almost perfect agreement 
(κ > 0.69) was observed between the radiographers and AI on the nipple in 
profile criterion. We observed a slight to moderate agreement for the other 
criteria (κ = 0.06-0.52) and generally a higher agreement between the two pairs 
of radiographers (mean κ = 0.70) than between the radiographers and AI (mean 
κ = 0.41).
CONCLUSIONS: AI has great potential in evaluating breast position criteria in 
mammography by reducing subjectivity. However, varying agreement between 
radiographers and AI was observed. Standardized and evidence-based criteria for 
definitions, understandings and assessment methods are needed to reach optimal 
image quality in mammography.

BACKGROUND: Concerns have been raised that patients requiring emergency care may 
not have accessed healthcare services during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
lockdown.
METHODS: This case control study aimed to understand changes in characteristics 
and diagnosis of patients attending a large UK Emergency Department (ED) during 
the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (March-May 2020) compared with 
equivalent weeks in 2019.
RESULTS: We found a 50.7% drop in first attendances to the ED in 2020. 
Likelihood of attendance and admission decreased for paediatric patients and 
increased for patients ≥ 46 years, and for men. Likelihood of admission 
increased for all Black ethnic groups and for patients from the most deprived 
index of multiple deprivation quintiles. This shift to an older, male, more 
deprived patient population with greater representation of ethnic minority 
groups was amplified in the 'Infections' diagnostic category.
CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has dramatically impacted ED usage. Our analysis 
contributes to local resource planning and understanding of changes in 
healthcare-seeking behaviour during the pandemic. Future research to identify 
positive behaviour changes could help sustain a reduction in non-urgent visits 
in the longer term.

Cognitive Reserve and Driving-Related Cognitive Abilities in a Sample of Oldest 
Old Drivers Undergoing Assessment of Fitness to Drive.

This study examines the relationship between age, cognitive reserve (CR), and 
driving-related cognitive abilities in a sample of oldest old drivers undergoing 
evaluation of fitness to drive. Structural equation modeling was used to 
investigate the associations between age, CR, and performances to a standardized 
set of cognitive tests assessing fitness to drive. Education and work complexity 
were used as proxy measures of CR. The results showed both measures of CR, but 
not age, were significantly associated with higher general intelligence. 
Education also predicted higher decision speed, and decision speed partly 
mediated the effect of education on general intelligence. These findings suggest 
that over age of 80 years old, CR was a better predictor of driving-related 
cognitive abilities than age. Education was associated with better performance 
across different cognitive domains including processing speed.

The COVID-19 coronavirus has spread rapidly around the world and has caused 
global panic. Chest CT images play a major role in confirming positive COVID-19 
patients. The computer aided diagnosis of COVID-19 from CT images based on 
artificial intelligence have been developed and deployed in some hospitals. But 
environmental influences and the movement of lung will affect the image quality, 
causing the lung parenchyma and pneumonia area unclear in CT images. Therefore, 
the performance of COVID-19's artificial intelligence diagnostic algorithm is 
reduced. If chest CT images are reconstructed, the accuracy and performance of 
the aided diagnostic algorithm may be improved. In this paper, a new aided 
diagnostic algorithm for COVID-19 based on super-resolution reconstructed images 
and convolutional neural network is presented. Firstly, the SRGAN neural network 
is used to reconstruct super-resolution images from original chest CT images. 
Then COVID-19 images and Non-COVID-19 images are classified from 
super-resolution chest CT images by VGG16 neural network. Finally, the 
performance of this method is verified by the pubic COVID-CT dataset and 
compared with other aided diagnosis methods of COVID-19. The experimental 
results show that improving the data quality through SRGAN neural network can 
greatly improve the final classification accuracy when the data quality is low. 
This proves that this method can obtain high accuracy, sensitivity and 
specificity in the examined test image datasets and has similar performance to 
other state-of-the-art deep learning aided algorithms.

In this article, we provide an evidence-based primer of current tools and 
evolving concepts in the area of intraprocedural artificial intelligence (AI) 
methods in colonoscopy and laparoscopy as a 'procedure companion', with specific 
focus on colorectal cancer recognition and characterisation. These interventions 
are both likely beneficiaries from an impending rapid phase in technical and 
technological evolution. The domains where AI is most likely to impact are 
explored as well as the methodological pitfalls pertaining to AI methods. Such 
issues include the need for large volumes of data to train AI systems, questions 
surrounding false positive rates, explainability and interpretability as well as 
recent concerns surrounding instabilities in current deep learning (DL) models. 
The area of biophysics-inspired models, a potential remedy to some of these 
pitfalls, is explored as it could allow our understanding of the fundamental 
physiological differences between tissue types to be exploited in real time with 
the help of computer-assisted interpretation. Right now, such models can include 
data collected from dynamic fluorescence imaging in surgery to characterise 
lesions by their biology reducing the number of cases needed to build a reliable 
and interpretable classification system. Furthermore, instead of focussing on 
image-by-image analysis, such systems could analyse in a continuous fashion, 
more akin to how we view procedures in real life and make decisions in a manner 
more comparable to human decision-making. Synergistical approaches can ensure AI 
methods usefully embed within practice thus safeguarding against collapse of 
this exciting field of investigation as another 'boom and bust' cycle of AI 
endeavour.

OBJECTIVE: The impact of adolescent cannabis use is a pressing public health 
question owing to the high rates of use and links to negative outcomes. This 
study considered the association between problematic adolescent cannabis use and 
methylation.
METHOD: Using an enrichment-based sequencing approach, a methylome-wide 
association study (MWAS) was performed of problematic adolescent cannabis use in 
703 adolescent samples from the Great Smoky Mountain Study. Using epigenomic 
deconvolution, MWASs were performed for the main cell types in blood: 
granulocytes, T cells, B cells, and monocytes. Enrichment testing was conducted 
to establish overlap between cannabis-associated methylation differences and 
variants associated with negative mental health effects of adolescent cannabis 
use.
RESULTS: Whole-blood analyses identified 45 significant CpGs, and cell 
type-specific analyses yielded 32 additional CpGs not identified in the 
whole-blood MWAS. Significant overlap was observed between the B-cell MWAS and 
genetic studies of education attainment and intelligence. Furthermore, the 
results from both T cells and monocytes overlapped with findings from an MWAS of 
psychosis conducted in brain tissue.
CONCLUSION: In one of the first methylome-wide association studies of adolescent 
cannabis use, several methylation sites located in genes of importance for 
potentially relevant brain functions were identified. These findings resulted in 
several testable hypotheses by which cannabis-associated methylation can impact 
neurological development and inflammation response as well as potential 
mechanisms linking cannabis-associated methylation to potential downstream 
mental health effects.

Recently, the prevalence trend of pulmonary fungal infection (PFI) has rapidly 
increased. Changes in the risk factors for, distributions of underlying diseases 
associated with and clinical characteristics of some individual PFIs have been 
reported in the past decade. However, data regarding PFIs remain uncertain. This 
study reports the epidemiological characteristics and trends of PFIs over time 
in recent years. We applied an automated natural language processing (NLP) 
system to extract clinically relevant information from the electronic health 
records (EHRs) of PFI patients at the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou 
Medical University. Then, a trend analysis was performed. From January 1, 2013, 
to December 31, 2019, 40,504 inpatients and 219,414 outpatients with respiratory 
diseases were screened, in which 1368 inpatients and 1313 outpatients with PFI 
were identified. These patients were from throughout the country, but most 
patients were from southern China. Upward trends in PFIs were observed in both 
hospitalized patients and outpatients (P<0.05). The stratification by age showed 
that the incidence of hospitalized patients aged 14-30 years exhibited the most 
obvious upward trend, increasing from 9.5 per 1000 patients in 2013 to 88.3 per 
1000 patients in 2019. Aspergillosis (56.69%) was the most common PFI, but 
notably, the incidence rates of Talaromyces marneffei, which used to be 
considered uncommon, exhibited the most rapid increases. In younger PFI 
patients, the incidence and trend of PFIs have increased. Infection by 
previously uncommon pathogens has also gradually increased. Increased attention 
should be paid to young PFI patients and uncommon PFI pathogen infections.

OBJECTIVES: This study aims to evaluate an automatic segmentation algorithm for 
pharyngeal airway in cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images using a deep 
learning artificial intelligence (AI) system.
SETTING AND SAMPLE POPULATION: Archives of the CBCT images were reviewed, and 
the data of 306 subjects with the pharyngeal airway were included in this 
retrospective study.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A machine learning algorithm, based on Convolutional 
Neural Network (CNN), did the segmentation of the pharyngeal airway on serial 
CBCT images. Semi-automatic software (ITK-SNAP) was used to manually generate 
the airway, and the results were compared with artificial intelligence. Dice 
similarity coefficient (DSC) and Intersection over Union (IoU) were used as the 
accuracy of segmentation in comparing the measurements of human measurements and 
artificial intelligence algorithms.
RESULTS: The human observer found the average volume of the pharyngeal airway to 
be 18.08 cm3 and artificial intelligence to be 17.32 cm3 . For pharyngeal airway 
segmentation, a dice ratio of 0.919 and a weighted IoU of 0.993 is achieved.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, a successful AI algorithm that automatically 
segments the pharyngeal airway from CBCT images was created. It can be useful in 
the quick and easy calculation of pharyngeal airway volume from CBCT images for 
clinical application.

RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To describe and analyze the pediatric neuroradiology 
implicit curriculum for general-pediatric and neuro-pediatric radiology 
fellowship training in order to define specific trainee needs and inform an 
explicit pediatric neuroradiology curriculum.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A focus group of pediatric radiologists, pediatric 
neuroradiologists and fellows was conducted to create a needs assessment 
questionnaire that focused on training experience, current job, and a list of 
essential competency items. The questionnaire was distributed to 175 members of 
the Society for Pediatric Radiology. Data were derived from categorical and 
continuous survey variables. Using an inductive approach, we analyzed and 
systematically inspected the data to derive themes regarding trainee needs and 
how they might inform an explicit curriculum.
RESULTS: Fifty-seven pediatric radiologists (response rate of 33%) responded to 
the survey. Sixty-three percent of respondents were fellowship trained in 
general pediatric radiology, 21% in pediatric neuroradiology, and 16% in both. 
In their current jobs, 75% of respondents were responsible for interpreting some 
pediatric neuroradiology. 50% or greater reported limited or no fellowship 
instruction in five areas of imaging interpretation: fetal neuroimaging; ear 
and/or nose and/or throat imaging; head and neck imaging; neuroembryology; 
neuro-spectroscopy and four areas of technical skills and/or image quality: 
reducing imaging time; choice of contrast agents; sedation; understanding 
clinical management pathways.
CONCLUSION: Trainees endorse inadequate training in certain aspects of imaging 
interpretation and technical skills which are known to remain a significant and 
vital aspect of pediatric neuroradiology practice, revealing an opportunity to 
emphasize these aspects in an explicit curriculum and dedicate educational 
resources towards this cause.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the prognostic factors for orthognathic surgery (OGS) in 
children with cleft lip and/or palate (CL/P) using artificial intelligence (AI) 
systems.
DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: An orthodontic department at a university dental hospital.
PARTICIPANTS: This study included 126 patients with bilateral and unilateral 
CL/P for whom lateral cephalograms were obtained at three time points: 7 (T1), 
10 (T2) and 15 (T3) years of age.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cleft type, severity of lip separation at birth, number 
of missing teeth, sex, palatal repair methods and surgeons, cephalometric 
variables at T1 and T2, and the total duration of orthodontic treatment were 
examined as predictors. The need for OGS and skeletal and dental discrepancies 
at T3 was examined as outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of six models were developed, with a mean area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.93. Multiple prognostic factors for 
OGS were identified. In particular, the number of clefts in the lip and alveolus 
showed relatively high odds ratios, as did anterior crossbite at T3. Achieving 
palatal closure with the push-back method, rather than Furlow's method, was also 
found to be a predictive factor for anterior crossbite at T3, with high odds 
ratios.
CONCLUSIONS: The prognostic factors for OGS determined by the AI systems were 
the number of clefts in the lip and alveolus, the palatal repair method, male 
sex, several cephalometric variables for the sagittal and vertical dimensions, 
growth patterns and the number of missing teeth.

PURPOSE: In this proof of principle study, we evaluated the diagnostic accuracy 
of the novel Nox BodySleepTM 1.0 algorithm (Nox Medical, Iceland) for the 
estimation of disease severity and sleep stages based on features extracted from 
actigraphy and respiratory inductance plethysmography (RIP) belts. Validation 
was performed against in-lab polysomnography (PSG) in patients with 
sleep-disordered breathing (SDB).
METHODS: Patients received PSG according to AASM. Sleep stages were manually 
scored using the AASM criteria and the recording was evaluated by the novel 
algorithm. The results were analyzed by descriptive statistics methods (IBM SPSS 
Statistics 25.0).
RESULTS: We found a strong Pearson correlation (r=0.91) with a bias of 0.2/h for 
AHI estimation as well as a good correlation (r=0.81) and an overestimation of 
14 min for total sleep time (TST). Sleep efficiency (SE) was also valued with a 
good Pearson correlation (r=0.73) and an overestimation of 2.1%. Wake epochs 
were estimated with a sensitivity of 0.65 and a specificity of 0.59 while REM 
and non-REM (NREM) phases were evaluated a sensitivity of 0.72 and 0.74, 
respectively. Specificity was 0.74 for NREM and 0.68 for REM. Additionally, a 
Cohen's kappa of 0.62 was found for this 3-class classification problem.
CONCLUSION: The algorithm shows a moderate diagnostic accuracy for the 
estimation of sleep. In addition, the algorithm determines the AHI with good 
agreement with the manual scoring and it shows good diagnostic accuracy in 
estimating wake-sleep transition. The presented algorithm seems to be an 
appropriate tool to increase the diagnostic accuracy of portable monitoring. The 
validated diagnostic algorithm promises a more appropriate and cost-effective 
method if integrated in out-of-center (OOC) testing of patients with suspicion 
for SDB.

Transsacral corridors at levels S1 and S2 represent complex osseous spaces 
allowing percutaneous fixation of non- or minimally-displaced fragility 
fractures of the sacrum. To safely place transsacral implants, they must be 
completely intraosseous. However, standard radiographs and CT do not properly 
demonstrate the corridor's intricate configuration. Our goal was to facilitate 
the three-dimensional assessment of transsacral corridors using artificial 
intelligence and the planning of transsacral implant positioning. In total, 100 
pelvic CTs (49 women, mean age: 58.6 ± SD 14.8 years; 51 men, mean age: 
60.7 ± SD 13 years) were used to compute a 3D statistical model of the pelvic 
ring. On the basis of morphologic features (=predictors) and principal 
components scores (=response), regression learners were interactively trained, 
validated, and tuned to predict/sample personalized 3D pelvic models. They were 
matched via thin-plate spline transformation to a series of 20 pelvic CTs with 
fragility fractures of the sacrum (18 women and 2 men, age: 69-9.5 years, mean 
age: 78.65 ± SD 8.4 years). These models demonstrated the availability, 
dimension, cross-section, and symmetry of transsacral corridors S1 and S2, as 
well as the planned implant position, dimension, axes, and entry and exit 
points. The complete intraosseous pathway was controlled in CT reconstructions. 
We succeeded to establish a workflow determining transsacral corridors S1 and S2 
using artificial intelligence and 3D statistical modeling.

PURPOSE: The integration of Artificial Intelligence into medical practices has 
recently been advocated for the promise to bring increased efficiency and 
effectiveness to these practices. Nonetheless, little research has so far been 
aimed at understanding the best human-AI interaction protocols in collaborative 
tasks, even in currently more viable settings, like independent double-reading 
screening tasks.
METHODS: To this aim, we report about a retrospective case-control study, 
involving 12 board-certified radiologists, in the detection of knee lesions by 
means of Magnetic Resonance Imaging, in which we simulated the serial 
combination of two Deep Learning models with humans in eight double-reading 
protocols. Inspired by the so-called Kasparov's Laws, we investigate whether the 
combination of humans and AI models could achieve better performance than AI 
models alone, and whether weak reader, when supported by fit-for-use interaction 
protocols, could out-perform stronger readers.
RESULTS: We discuss two main findings: groups of humans who perform 
significantly worse than a state-of-the-art AI can significantly outperform it 
if their judgements are aggregated by majority voting (in concordance with the 
first part of the Kasparov's law); small ensembles of significantly weaker 
readers can significantly outperform teams of stronger readers, supported by the 
same computational tool, when the judgments of the former ones are combined 
within "fit-for-use" protocols (in concordance with the second part of the 
Kasparov's law).
CONCLUSION: Our study shows that good interaction protocols can guarantee 
improved decision performance that easily surpasses the performance of 
individual agents, even of realistic super-human AI systems. This finding 
highlights the importance of focusing on how to guarantee better co-operation 
within human-AI teams, so to enable safer and more human sustainable care 
practices.

PURPOSE: In 2-dimensional lateral cephalometric radiographs, patients with 
severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) exhibit a more crowded oropharynx in 
comparison with non-OSA. We tested the hypothesis that machine learning, an 
application of artificial intelligence (AI), could be used to detect patients 
with severe OSA based on 2-dimensional images.
METHODS: A deep convolutional neural network was developed (n = 1258; 90%) and 
tested (n = 131; 10%) using data from 1389 (100%) lateral cephalometric 
radiographs obtained from individuals diagnosed with severe OSA (n = 867; apnea 
hypopnea index > 30 events/h sleep) or non-OSA (n = 522; apnea hypopnea index 
< 5 events/h sleep) at a single center for sleep disorders. Three kinds of data 
sets were prepared by changing the area of interest using a single image: the 
original image without any modification (full image), an image containing a 
facial profile, upper airway, and craniofacial soft/hard tissues (main region), 
and an image containing part of the occipital region (head only). A radiologist 
also performed a conventional manual cephalometric analysis of the full image 
for comparison.
RESULTS: The sensitivity/specificity was 0.87/0.82 for full image, 0.88/0.75 for 
main region, 0.71/0.63 for head only, and 0.54/0.80 for the manual analysis. The 
area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve was the highest for main 
region 0.92, for full image 0.89, for head only 0.70, and for manual 
cephalometric analysis 0.75.
CONCLUSIONS: A deep convolutional neural network identified individuals with 
severe OSA with high accuracy. Future research on this concept using AI and 
images can be further encouraged when discussing triage of OSA.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: As magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signs of normal 
pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) may precede clinical symptoms we sought to evaluate 
an algorithm that automatically detects this pattern.
METHODS: A support vector machine (SVM) was trained in 30 NPH patients treated 
with ventriculoperitoneal shunts and 30 healthy controls. For comparison, four 
neuroradiologists visually assessed sagittal MPRAGE images and graded them as no 
NPH pattern, possible NPH pattern, or definite NPH pattern.
RESULTS: Human accuracy to visually detect a NPH was between 0.85 and 0.97. 
Interobserver agreement was substantial (κ = 0.656). Accuracy of the SVM 
algorithm was 0.93 and AUROC 0.99. Among 272 prespecified regions, gray matter 
and CSF volumes of both caudate, the right parietal operculum, the left basal 
forebrain, and the 4th ventricle showed the highest discriminative power to 
separate a NPH and a no NPH pattern.
CONCLUSION: A NPH pattern can be reliably detected using a support vector 
machine (SVM). Its role in the work-up of asymptomatic patients or 
neurodegenerative disease has to be evaluated.

The role of school-based relationships for school well-being: How different are 
high- and average-ability students?

BACKGROUND: Relationships with peers and teachers are keys for children's 
psychosocial development. However, it is unclear whether this also applies for 
high-ability children. This study adds to the literature by longitudinally 
examining the role of interpersonal relationships in the educational context for 
high- and average-ability students.
AIMS: In this study, we examined whether high- and average-ability students 
differ in terms of peer acceptance, teacher conflict, and school well-being. 
Further, we studied the potential bi-directional effects between school 
well-being, teacher conflict, and peer acceptance in late childhood and examined 
whether the relations between these concepts differ between high- and 
average-ability students.
SAMPLE: The total sample consisted of 3,101 Belgian students (49.9% boys, Mage 
 = 9.76 years), with 348 high-ability and 2,753 average-ability students.
METHODS: Cognitive ability was assessed in Grade 3 with two cognitive ability 
tests (for crystallized intelligence and fluid intelligence, respectively). The 
students were followed for three years (Grades 4, 5, and 6), and each year their 
current teacher filled out questionnaires regarding teacher-child conflict, peer 
acceptance, and school well-being.
RESULTS: High-ability students showed lower teacher conflict, higher peer 
acceptance, and better school well-being than average-ability students. 
Cross-lagged analyses showed that peer acceptance consistently predicted school 
well-being over time, while Grade 4 school well-being impacted Grade 5 teacher 
conflict. Also, better peer acceptance in Grade 5 predicted lower 
teacher-student conflict in Grade 6. Multigroup analyses revealed similar 
associations for both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that high-ability students in general display more 
positive school-based social relationships and school well-being than 
average-ability students. We found no differences in the links between these 
variables for both groups (i.e., high-ability students and average-ability 
students).

BACKGROUND: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is a prerequisite for detecting 
upper gastrointestinal lesions especially early gastric cancer (EGC). An 
artificial intelligence system has been shown to monitor blind spots during EGD. 
In this study, we updated the system (ENDOANGEL), verified its effectiveness in 
improving endoscopy quality, and pretested its performance in detecting EGC in a 
multicenter randomized controlled trial.
METHODS: ENDOANGEL was developed using deep convolutional neural networks and 
deep reinforcement learning. Patients undergoing EGD in five hospitals were 
randomly assigned to the ENDOANGEL-assisted group or to a control group without 
use of ENDOANGEL. The primary outcome was the number of blind spots. Secondary 
outcomes included performance of ENDOANGEL in predicting EGC in a clinical 
setting.
RESULTS: 1050 patients were randomized, and 498 and 504 patients in the 
ENDOANGEL and control groups, respectively, were analyzed. Compared with the 
control group, the ENDOANGEL group had fewer blind spots (mean 5.38 [standard 
deviation (SD) 4.32] vs. 9.82 [SD 4.98]; P < 0.001) and longer inspection time 
(5.40 [SD 3.82] vs. 4.38 [SD 3.91] minutes; P < 0.001). In the ENDOANGEL group, 
196 gastric lesions with pathological results were identified. ENDOANGEL 
correctly predicted all three EGCs (one mucosal carcinoma and two high grade 
neoplasias) and two advanced gastric cancers, with a per-lesion accuracy of 
84.7 %, sensitivity of 100 %, and specificity of 84.3 % for detecting gastric 
cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: In this multicenter study, ENDOANGEL was an effective and robust 
system to improve the quality of EGD and has the potential to detect EGC in real 
time.

INTRODUCTION: Despite increasing endorsement of near-infrared perfusion 
assessment using indocyanine green (ICG) during colorectal surgery, little work 
has yet been done regarding learning curve and interobserver variation most 
especially on surgical video reflective of real-world usage.
METHODS: Surgeons with established expertise in ICG usage were invited to 
participate in the study along with others without such experience including 
trainees. All participants completed an opinion questionnaire and interpreted 
video presentations of fluorescence angiograms in a variety of colorectal case 
scenarios. An interactive video platform (Mindstamp) enabled dynamic annotation. 
Statistical analysis of data was performed using Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney 
testing as well as Intraclass Correlation Coefficients and Fleiss Multi-rater 
Kappa Scoring.
RESULTS: Forty participants (six experts) completed questionnaire data and 
provided judgement of 14 videos (nine showing proximal colonic transection site 
perfusion, four showing completed anastomoses and one an acutely strangulated 
bowel). 70% felt > 10 cases were needed for competency in use with the majority 
of experts advocating > 50 (p < 0.05). Overall agreement among experts was 
"good" for videos showing colonic transection perfusion (versus "moderate" among 
in-experts) with experts clustering more distally. In contrast, there was no 
interpretation concordance among experts or in-experts when judging ICG 
perfusion sufficiency on a yes/no basis.
CONCLUSION: Significant experience is recommended before reliance on ICG 
perfusion angiograms. ICG fluorescence assessment is prone to variable 
interpretation and influenced by experience and, perhaps, knowledge of 
preassessment operative steps suggesting a role for objective flow analysis with 
artificial intelligence methods as the next phase of this technology.

BACKGROUD: Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is involved in the biosynthesis of adenosine 
triphosphate (ATP), and is most abundant in the mitochondrial membrane. The 
primary CoQ10 deficiency caused by COQ2 defect is mostly manifested as 
encephalopathy, encephalopathy with nephropathy, and rarely as an isolated 
nephrotic syndrome.
METHODS: Clinical and pathological data and peripheral blood samples of 2 
siblings with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) and their family 
members of a Chinese pedigree were collected. DNA was extracted and subjected to 
next-generation sequencing of target genes of hereditary nephropathy.
RESULTS: Compound heterozygous mutations of COQ2 (c.1058A > G, p.Y353C, paternal 
and c.973A > G, p.T325A, maternal)were identified in both siblings of the 
pedigree. Mutation of p.Y353C was novel. The proband was a girl, who presented 
with SRNS at the age of 7 months. CoQ10 was administered after the gene 
sequencing results came out. Proteinuria decreased gradually to 1+, occasionally 
negative. The child was normal in growth and intelligence. She is now 4 years 
old. The second patient was her elder brother. He was found to have SRNS at the 
age of 2 years old. Renal pathology indicated focal segmental glomerulosclerosis 
(FSGS). Electronic microcopy revealed that a large quantity of mitochondria with 
normal contour was accumulated within the podocytes. Both patients were in 
normal intelligence without convulsion.
CONCLUSION: The 2 cases harboring COQ2compound heterozygous mutations presented 
with isolated SRNS, with a renal pathology of FSGS and a large quantity of 
mitochondria with normal contour accumulated within the podocytes. CoQ10 was 
efficacy in eliminating proteinuria.

BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant therapy may improve survival of patients with pancreatic 
adenocarcinoma; however, determining response to therapy is difficult. 
Artificial intelligence allows for novel analysis of images. We hypothesized 
that a deep learning model can predict tumor response to NAC.
METHODS: Patients with pancreatic cancer receiving neoadjuvant therapy prior to 
pancreatoduodenectomy were identified between November 2009 and January 2018. 
The College of American Pathologists Tumor Regression Grades 0-2 were defined as 
pathologic response (PR) and grade 3 as no response (NR). Axial images from 
preoperative computed tomography scans were used to create a 5-layer 
convolutional neural network and LeNet deep learning model to predict PRs. The 
hybrid model incorporated decrease in carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) of 10%. 
Accuracy was determined by area under the curve.
RESULTS: A total of 81 patients were included in the study. Patients were 
divided between PR (333 images) and NR (443 images). The pure model had an area 
under the curve (AUC) of .738 (P < .001), whereas the hybrid model had an AUC of 
.785 (P < .001). CA19-9 decrease alone was a poor predictor of response with an 
AUC of .564 (P = .096).
CONCLUSIONS: A deep learning model can predict pathologic tumor response to 
neoadjuvant therapy for patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma and the model is 
improved with the incorporation of decreases in serum CA19-9. Further model 
development is needed before clinical application.

OBJECTIVE: It is unclear if pediatric executive dysfunction assessed only with 
cognitive tasks predicts clinically relevant outcomes independently of 
psychiatric diagnoses. This study tested the stability and validity of a 
task-based classification of executive function.
METHOD: A total of 2,207 individuals (6-17 years old) from the Brazilian 
High-Risk Cohort Study participated in this study (1,930 at baseline, 1,532 at 
follow-up). Executive function was measured using tests of working memory and 
inhibitory control. Dichotomized age- and sex-standardized performances were 
used as input in latent class analysis and receiver operating curves to create 
an executive dysfunction classification (EDC). The study tested EDC's stability 
over time, association with symptoms, functional impairment, a polymorphism in 
the CADM2 gene, polygenic risk scores (PRS), and brain structure. Analyses 
covaried for age, sex, social class, IQ, and psychiatric diagnoses.
RESULTS: EDC at baseline predicted itself at follow-up (odds ratio [OR] = 5.11; 
95% CI 3.41-7.64). Participants in the EDC reported symptoms spanning several 
domains of psychopathology and exhibited impairment in multiple settings, 
including more adverse school events (OR = 2.530; 95% CI 1.838-3.483). Children 
in the EDC presented higher attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and lower 
educational attainment PRS at baseline; higher schizophrenia PRS at follow-up; 
and lower chances of presenting a polymorphism in a gene previously linked to 
high performance in executive function (CADM2 gene). They also exhibited smaller 
intracranial volumes and smaller bilateral cortical surface areas in several 
brain regions.
CONCLUSION: Task-based executive dysfunction is associated with several 
validators, independently of psychiatric diagnoses and intelligence. Further 
refinement of task-based assessments might generate clinically useful tools.

Human emotions are strongly coupled with physical and mental health of any 
individual. While emotions exbibit complex physiological and biological 
phenomenon, yet studies reveal that physiological signals can be used as an 
indirect measure of emotions. In unprecedented circumstances alike the 
coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak, a remote Internet of Things (IoT) enabled 
solution, coupled with AI can interpret and communicate emotions to serve 
substantially in healthcare and related fields. This work proposes an integrated 
IoT framework that enables wireless communication of physiological signals to 
data processing hub where long short-term memory (LSTM)-based emotion 
recognition is performed. The proposed framework offers real-time communication 
and recognition of emotions that enables health monitoring and distance learning 
support amidst pandemics. In this study, the achieved results are very 
promising. In the proposed IoT protocols (TS-MAC and R-MAC), ultralow latency of 
1 ms is achieved. R-MAC also offers improved reliability in comparison to state 
of the art. In addition, the proposed deep learning scheme offers high 
performance ([Formula: see text]-score) of 95%. The achieved results in 
communications and AI match the interdependency requirements of deep learning 
and IoT frameworks, thus ensuring the suitability of proposed work in distance 
learning, student engagement, healthcare, emotion support, and general 
wellbeing.

Khobar, 31952 Saudi Arabia.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Chest X-ray data have been found to be very promising 
for assessing COVID-19 patients, especially for resolving emergency-department 
and urgent-care-center overcapacity. Deep-learning (DL) methods in artificial 
intelligence (AI) play a dominant role as high-performance classifiers in the 
detection of the disease using chest X-rays. Given many new DL models have been 
being developed for this purpose, the objective of this study is to investigate 
the fine tuning of pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the 
classification of COVID-19 using chest X-rays. If fine-tuned pre-trained CNNs 
can provide equivalent or better classification results than other more 
sophisticated CNNs, then the deployment of AI-based tools for detecting COVID-19 
using chest X-ray data can be more rapid and cost-effective.
METHODS: Three pretrained CNNs, which are AlexNet, GoogleNet, and SqueezeNet, 
were selected and fine-tuned without data augmentation to carry out 2-class and 
3-class classification tasks using 3 public chest X-ray databases.
RESULTS: In comparison with other recently developed DL models, the 3 pretrained 
CNNs achieved very high classification results in terms of accuracy, 
sensitivity, specificity, precision, F1 score, and area under the 
receiver-operating-characteristic curve.
CONCLUSION: AlexNet, GoogleNet, and SqueezeNet require the least training time 
among pretrained DL models, but with suitable selection of training parameters, 
excellent classification results can be achieved without data augmentation by 
these networks. The findings contribute to the urgent need for harnessing the 
pandemic by facilitating the deployment of AI tools that are fully automated and 
readily available in the public domain for rapid implementation.

BACKGROUND: We aimed to determine the growth-development periods and gender from 
the cervical vertebrae using the artificial neural network (ANN).
SETTING AND SAMPLE POPULATION: The cephalometric and hand-wrist radiographs 
obtained from 419 patients aged between 8 and 17 years were included in our 
study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our retrospective study consisted of 419 patients' 
cephalometric and hand-wrist radiographs. The cephalometric radiographs were 
divided into six cervical vertebrae stages (CVS). Correlations were evaluated 
between hand-wrist maturation level, CVS, and ages. Twenty-seven vertebral 
reference points are marked on the cephalometric radiograph, and 32 linear 
measurements were taken. With the combination of these measurements, 24 
different data sets were formed to train ANN. Thus, 24 different ANN models for 
the determination of the growth-development periods were obtained. According to 
the results, seven ANN models that have a high success level and clinically 
applicable were selected. Also, an ANN model was done by all measurements and 
age for the determination of gender from cervical vertebrae.
RESULTS: Significantly positive correlations between hand-wrist maturation 
level, CVS and ages were detected. The ANN-7 model (32 linear measurements and 
age) accuracy value was found 0.9427. The highest model accuracy, 0.8687, with 
the least linear measurements, was obtained by drawing 13 linear measurements, 
using vertical measurements and indents. Gender was determined using ANN 
(0.8950) on cervical vertebrae data.
CONCLUSION: The growth-development periods and gender were determined from the 
cervical vertebrae by using ANN. The success of the ANN algorithm has been 
satisfactory. Further studies are needed for a fully automatic decision support 
system.

BACKGROUND: Cardiomegaly is a relatively common incidental finding on chest 
X-rays; if left untreated, it can result in significant complications. Using 
Artificial Intelligence for diagnosing cardiomegaly could be beneficial, as this 
pathology may be underreported, or overlooked, especially in busy or 
under-staffed settings.
PURPOSE: To explore the feasibility of applying four different transfer learning 
methods to identify the presence of cardiomegaly in chest X-rays and to compare 
their diagnostic performance using the radiologists' report as the gold 
standard.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two thousand chest X-rays were utilized in the current 
study: 1000 were normal and 1000 had confirmed cardiomegaly. Of these exams, 80% 
were used for training and 20% as a holdout test dataset. A total of 2048 deep 
features were extracted using Google's Inception V3, VGG16, VGG19, and 
SqueezeNet networks. A logistic regression algorithm optimized in regularization 
terms was used to classify chest X-rays into those with presence or absence of 
cardiomegaly.
RESULTS: Diagnostic accuracy is reported by means of sensitivity, specificity, 
positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV), with the 
VGG19 network providing the best values of sensitivity (84%), specificity (83%), 
PPV (83%), NPV (84%), and overall accuracy (84,5%). The other networks presented 
sensitivity at 64.1%-82%, specificity at 77.1%-81.1%, PPV at 74%-81.4%, NPV at 
68%-82%, and overall accuracy at 71%-81.3%.
CONCLUSION: Deep learning using transfer learning methods based on VGG19 network 
can be used for the automatic detection of cardiomegaly on chest X-ray images. 
However, further validation and training of each method is required before 
application to clinical cases.

BACKGROUND: This study was aimed to develop a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) 
system with deep-learning technique and to validate its efficiency on detecting 
the four categories of lesions such as polyps, advanced cancer, erosion/ulcer 
and varices at endoscopy.
METHODS: A deep convolutional neural network (CNN) that consists of more than 50 
layers were trained with a big dataset containing 327,121 white light images 
(WLI) of endoscopy from 117,005 cases collected from 2012 to 2017. Two CAD 
models were developed using images with or without annotation of the training 
dataset. The efficiency of the CAD system detecting the four categories of 
lesions was validated by another dataset containing consecutive cases from 2018 
to 2019.
RESULTS: A total of 1734 cases with 33,959 images were included in the 
validation datasets which containing lesions of polyps 1265, advanced cancer 
500, erosion/ulcer 486, and varices 248. The CAD system developed in this study 
may detect polyps, advanced cancer, erosion/ulcer and varices as abnormality 
with the sensitivity of 88.3% and specificity of 90.3%, respectively, in 0.05 s. 
The training datasets with annotation may enhance either sensitivity or 
specificity about 20%, p = 0.000. The sensitivities and specificities for 
polyps, advanced cancer, erosion/ulcer and varices reached about 90%, 
respectively. The detect efficiency for the four categories of lesions reached 
to 89.7%.
CONCLUSION: The CAD model for detection of multiple lesions in gastrointestinal 
lumen would be potentially developed into a double check along with real-time 
assessment and interpretation of the findings encountered by the endoscopists 
and may be a benefit to reduce the events of missing lesions.

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to validate and compare the prognostic 
performance of the albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade, platelet-albumin-bilirubin 
(PALBI) grade, Child-Pugh (CP) grade, and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease 
(MELD) score in predicting the 1-year variceal rebleeding probability using 
artificial intelligence for patients with cirrhosis and variceal bleeding 
undergoing early transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) 
procedures.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This dual-center retrospective study included two 
cohorts, with patients enrolled between January 2016 and September 2018 in the 
training cohort and January 2017 and September 2018 in the validation cohort. In 
the training cohort, independent risk factors associated with the 1-year 
variceal rebleeding probability were identified using univariate and 
multivariate logistic analyses. ALBI-, PALBI-, Child-Pugh-, and MELD-based 
nomograms and an artificial neural network (ANN) model were established and 
validated internally in the training cohort and externally in the validation 
cohort, which included patients with variceal bleeding who were treated with 
preventive TIPS.
RESULTS: A total of 259 patients were included. The median follow-up periods 
were 24.1 and 18.9 months, and the 1-year variceal rebleeding rates were 12.3% 
(14/114) and 10.3% (15/145) in the training and validation cohorts, 
respectively. In the training cohort, all four variables were identified as 
independent risk factors. Four nomograms were then established and showed 
comparable prognostic performances after internal (C-index: 0.879, 0.829, 0.874, 
and 0.798) and external (C-index: 0.720, 0.719, 0.718, and 0.703) validation. 
The ANN demonstrated that these four variables had comparable importance in 
predicting the 1-year variceal rebleeding probability.
CONCLUSION: None of the four variables are optimal in predicting the 1-year 
variceal rebleeding probability for patients with cirrhosis and variceal 
bleeding undergoing early TIPS.

BACKGROUND: Hereditary colorectal cancer (HCRC) syndromes account for 10% of 
colorectal cancers but remain underdiagnosed. This feasibility project tested 
the utility of an artificial intelligence-based chatbot deployed to patients 
scheduled for colonoscopy to identify HCRC risk factors, educate participants 
about HCRC and obtain consent to genetic testing as an extension of genetic 
counselling of appropriate subjects. Genetic counsellor (GC) and genetic 
counselling assistant (GCA) time spent per subject was also measured.
METHODS: Patients scheduled for colonoscopy at Cleveland Clinic were invited via 
electronic medical record patient portal or letter prior to colonoscopy with a 
link to a chatbot administering the Colon Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (CCRAT) to 
screen for HCRC syndromes. Those with ≥1 positive response to a CCRAT question 
received chatbot-deployed genetic education and the option to receive genetic 
testing. An order for a 55-gene pan-cancer panel was placed for those 
consenting, and the subject had blood drawn on the day of colonoscopy. Results 
were disclosed by a GC or GCA by telephone. Subject demographics, progression 
through the chat, responses to CCRAT, personal and family history, genetic test 
results and communication with the subject were recorded. Descriptive statistics 
and two-tailed unpaired t-test and Fisher's exact test were used.
RESULTS: 506/4254 (11.9%) initiated and 487 (96.2%) completed the chat with the 
chatbot. 215 (44.1%) answered 'yes' to ≥1 CCRAT question and all completed 
pretest education. 129/181 (71.3%) subjects who consented completed testing, and 
12 (9.3%) were found to have a germline pathogenic variant. Per subject, the GC 
spent a mean of 14.3 (SD 7.3) and the GCA a mean of 19.2 (SD 9.8) minutes.
CONCLUSION: The use of a chatbot in this setting was a novel and feasible 
method, with the potential of increasing genetic screening and testing in 
individuals at risk of HCRC syndromes.

BACKGROUND: Older individuals encounter the greatest racial/gender biases. It is 
unknown whether younger generations, who often lead culture shifts, have racial 
and gender biases against older populations.
METHODS: Using Amazon's Mechanical Turk's crowdsourcing, we identified how an 
individual's race and gender are associated with perceptions of individuals aged 
mid-60s. Participants were asked to rate photograph appearances on Likert Scale 
(1-10). Interactions between participant and photograph race and gender were 
assessed with mixed effects models. Delta represents rating differences 
(positive value higher rating for Whites or women, negative value higher rating 
for African-Americans or men).
RESULTS: Among 1563 participants (mean 35 years ± 12), both non-Hispanic White 
(WP) and all Other race/ethnicity (OP) participants perceived African-American 
photos as more trustworthy [Delta WP -0.60(95%CI-0.83, - 0.37); Delta OP 
- 0.51(- 0.74,-0.28), interaction p = 0.06], more attractive [Delta non-Hispanic 
White participants - 0.63(- 0.97, - 0.29); Delta Other race/ethnicity 
participants - 0.40 (- 0.74, - 0.28), interaction p < 0.001], healthier [Delta 
WP -0.31(- 0.53, - 0.08); Delta OP -0.24(- 0.45, -0.03), interaction p = 1.00], 
and less threatening than White photos [Delta WP 0.79(0.36,1.22); Delta OP 
0.60(0.17,1.03), interaction p < 0.001]. Compared with OP, WP perceived 
African-American photos more favorably for intelligence (interaction p < 0.001). 
Both genders perceived photos of women as more trustworthy [Delta 
Women Participants (WmP) 0.50(0.27,0.73); Delta Men Participants(MnP) 
0.31(0.08,0.54); interaction p < 0.001] and men as more threatening [Delta WmP 
-0.84(-1.27, -0.41), Delta MnP - 0.77(- 1.20, - 0.34), interaction p = 0.93]. 
Compared with MnP, WmP perceived photos of women as happier and more attractive 
than men (interaction p < 0.001). Compared with WmP, MnP perceived men as 
healthier than women (interaction p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Among a young generation, older African-Americans were perceived 
more favorably than Whites. Gender perceptions followed gender norms. This 
suggests a decline in implicit bias against older minorities, but gender biases 
persist. Future work should investigate whether similar patterns are observed in 
healthcare.

A secondary analysis was conducted on longitudinal data collected from ELPI, a 
representative Chilean survey to model Chilean infant's receptive language using 
contextual, maternal and prenatal factors. The sample for the current study 
comprised children aged between 36 and 48 months (n = 3921). The sample was 
re-assessed when children were aged 60-72 months (n = 3100). Linear regression 
analyses were conducted. At the first time point, all the predictors included 
were significant (living area, health system provision, maternal intelligence 
and education, adolescent pregnancy, maternal medical appointments during 
pregnancy, and presence of a significant other at childbirth), except for 
smoking during pregnancy. The model explained 13% of the variance. However, when 
timepoint one receptive language scores were included in the analyses for when 
children were aged 60-72 months, only two variables remained as significant 
predictors: previous receptive language scores and maternal education, 
explaining 21% of the variance. Findings and implications are discussed.

Research on cognitive ability is done in different paradigms. In the Piagetian 
paradigm, cognitive ability focuses on cognitive development along qualitative 
stages. Interactive real scenarios, "Piagetian tasks", are constructed for 
measurement. According to age, tasks differing in complexity are applied in 
individual measurements. In the psychometric paradigm, the investigation of 
cognitive ability focuses on individual differences. Intelligence is seen as a 
quantitative construct with gradual differences between persons and ages. 
Paper-and-pencil tests with items differing in difficulty are used for IQ 
measurement of single persons or school classes. However, do those tasks measure 
two distinct cognitive abilities? Solving tasks in both approaches requires 
basic (speed, working memory) and complex cognitive abilities (reasoning, 
understanding). Regarding empirical relationships, we used three Austrian 
samples (in kindergarten four to six years old N = 40, in primary school six to 
eight years old N = 40, and nine to ten years old N = 41). They were tested with 
psychometric tests (Raven CPM or SPM) and Piagetian tasks. In addition, mental 
speed (ZVT) was measured in the two school samples. The average observed 
correlation between IQ and Piagetian tasks was r = .51. In factor analyses, the 
tests loaded on a common factor of general intelligence. Further analyses 
revealed that mental speed is correlated more strongly with psychometric 
(r = .50) than with Piagetian tasks (r = .39), while Piagetian tasks are more 
related to parental education indicators (speed: r = .11, Raven: r = .20, 
Piaget: r = .25).

RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Artificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly emerged as a 
field poised to affect nearly every aspect of medicine, especially radiology. A 
PubMed search for the terms "artificial intelligence radiology" demonstrates an 
exponential increase in publications on this topic in recent years. Despite 
these impending changes, medical education designed for future radiologists have 
only recently begun. We present our institution's efforts to address this 
problem as a model for a successful introductory curriculum into artificial 
intelligence in radiology titled AI-RADS.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The course was based on a sequence of foundational 
algorithms in AI; these algorithms were presented as logical extensions of each 
other and were introduced as familiar examples (spam filters, movie 
recommendations, etc.). Since most trainees enter residency without 
computational backgrounds, secondary lessons, such as pixel mathematics, were 
integrated in this progression. Didactic sessions were reinforced with a 
concurrent journal club highlighting the algorithm discussed in the previous 
lecture. To circumvent often intimidating technical descriptions, study guides 
for these papers were produced. Questionnaires were administered before and 
after each lecture to assess confidence in the material. Surveys were also 
submitted at each journal club assessing learner preparedness and 
appropriateness of the article.
RESULTS: The course received a 9.8/10 rating from residents for overall 
satisfaction. With the exception of the final lecture, there were significant 
increases in learner confidence in reading journal articles on AI after each 
lecture. Residents demonstrated significant increases in perceived understanding 
of foundational concepts in artificial intelligence across all mastery questions 
for every lecture.
CONCLUSION: The success of our institution's pilot AI-RADS course demonstrates a 
workable model of including AI in resident education.

As a common mental health problem, social anxiety refers to the fear and 
avoidance of interacting in social or performance situations, which plays a 
crucial role in many health and social problems. Although a growing body of 
studies has explored the neuroanatomical alterations related to social anxiety 
in clinical patients, far fewer have examined the association between social 
anxiety and brain morphology in the general population, which may help us 
understand the neural underpinnings of social anxiety more comprehensively. 
Here, utilizing a voxel-based morphometry approach via structural magnetic 
resonance imaging, we investigated brain gray matter correlates of social 
anxiety in 231 recent graduates of the same high school grade. We found that 
social anxiety was positively associated with gray matter volume in the right 
middle temporal gyrus (MTG), which is a core brain area for cognitive processing 
of emotions and feelings. Critically, emotional intelligence mediated the impact 
of right MTG volume on social anxiety. Notably, our results persisted even when 
controlling for the effects of general anxiety and depression. Altogether, our 
research reveals right MTG gray matter volume as a neurostructural correlate of 
social anxiety in a general sample of adolescents and suggests a potential 
indirect effect of emotional intelligence on the association between gray matter 
volume and social anxiety.

OBJECTIVE: A prerequisite of any psychological instrument used to compare 
individuals from different groups is measurement invariance (MI). It indicates 
that the test measures the same psychological constructs regardless of the 
particular grouping variable of the test-taker. Our purpose was to evaluate the 
MI across sex, age groups and educational levels in the recently adapted 
Estonian version of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale - Third Edition 
(WAIS-III).
METHOD: We analysed the Estonian standardization sample of WAIS-III (N = 770) 
with confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to establish the best baseline factor 
model for further analysis. Multi-group confirmatory factor analysis (MG-CFA) 
was applied to evaluate MI of the test and, granted this, mean differences 
across sex, age groups and educational levels.
RESULTS: CFA supported the four-factor model. The test demonstrated partial MI 
across sexes; latent mean comparisons showed that men had a significantly higher 
mean score on the Perceptual Organization factor. Partial MI also held across 
age groups and, as expected, older groups had significantly lower means than 
younger age groups. The analyses across the educational levels failed to prove 
the MI as the metric invariance was not tenable.
DISCUSSION: The results of this study provide evidence that the structural model 
underlying the Estonian adaption of WAIS-III is partially invariant across sex 
and age groups, hence the test functions same manner across these groups. 
Estonian WAIS-III was not invariant across the educational levels, which may 
indicate that the measure has a different structure or meaning to different 
educational groups.

From its origins in epidemiology, evidence-based medicine has promulgated a 
rigorous approach to assessing the validity, impact and applicability of 
hypothesis-driven empirical research used to evaluate the utility of diagnostic 
tests, prognostic tools and therapeutic interventions. Machine learning, a 
subset of artificial intelligence, uses computer programs to discover patterns 
and associations within huge datasets which are then incorporated into 
algorithms used to assist diagnoses and predict future outcomes, including 
response to therapies. How do these two fields relate to one another? What are 
their similarities and differences, their strengths and weaknesses? Can each 
learn from, and complement, the other in rendering clinical decision-making more 
informed and effective?

Trust in Autonomous Cars: Exploring the Role of Shared Moral Values, Reasoning, 
and Emotion in Safety-Critical Decisions.

Author information:

OBJECTIVE: Autonomous cars (ACs) controlled by artificial intelligence are 
expected to play a significant role in transportation in the near future. This 
study investigated determinants of trust in ACs.
BACKGROUND: Trust in ACs influences different variables, including the intention 
to adopt AC technology. Several studies on risk perception have verified that 
shared value determines trust in risk managers. Previous research has confirmed 
the effect of value similarity on trust in artificial intelligence. We focused 
on moral beliefs, specifically utilitarianism (belief in promoting a greater 
good) and deontology (belief in condemning deliberate harm), and tested the 
effects of shared moral beliefs on trust in ACs.
METHOD: We conducted three experiments (N = 128, 71, and 196, for each), 
adopting a thought experiment similar to the well-known trolley problem. We 
manipulated shared moral beliefs (shared vs. unshared) and driver (AC vs. 
human), providing participants with different moral dilemma scenarios. Trust in 
ACs was measured through a questionnaire.
RESULTS: The results of Experiment 1 showed that shared utilitarian belief 
strongly influenced trust in ACs. In Experiment 2 and Experiment 3, however, we 
did not find statistical evidence that shared deontological belief had an effect 
on trust in ACs.
CONCLUSION: The results of the three experiments suggest that the effect of 
shared moral beliefs on trust varies depending on the values that ACs share with 
humans.
APPLICATION: To promote AC implementation, policymakers and developers need to 
understand which values are shared between ACs and humans to enhance trust in 
ACs.

In reply to 'clinical biochemistry test eliminator providing cost-effectiveness 
with five algorithms': the Casablanca strategy.

In this journal, Ataman Gönel recently demonstrated that elimination of 
requested unnecessary tests by means of algorithms in an artificial intelligence 
program may contribute to the cost-effectiveness of medicine. However, test 
ordering is an essential part of clinical medicine and decision-making. Interns 
are responsible for a modest but significant excess in laboratory utilization 
and underestimate their control over laboratory testing. Even in the hands of 
experts, rational approaches to test ordering may be subverted by the Casablanca 
Strategy. Establishing a differential diagnosis and ordering only tests deemed 
necessary reflect the attainment of expertise in the clinical decision-making 
process. Residents and attendings in teaching roles should not underestimate the 
extent to which their clinical decision-making may be mimicked.

BACKGROUND: The use of artificial intelligence (AI) for skin cancer assessment 
has been an emerging topic in dermatology. Leadership of dermatologists is 
necessary in defining how these technologies fit into clinical practice.
OBJECTIVE: To characterize the evolution of AI in skin cancer assessment and 
characterize the involvement of dermatologists in developing these technologies.
METHODS: An electronic literature search was performed using PubMed by searching 
machine learning or artificial intelligence combined with skin cancer or 
melanoma. Articles were included if they used AI for screening and diagnosis of 
skin cancer using data sets consisting of dermoscopic images or photographs of 
gross lesions.
RESULTS: Fifty-one articles were included, and 41% of these had dermatologists 
included as authors. Articles that included dermatologists described algorithms 
built with more images versus articles that did not include dermatologists 
(mean, 12,111 vs 660 images, respectively). In terms of underlying technology, 
AI used for skin cancer assessment has followed trends in the field of image 
recognition.
LIMITATIONS: This review focused on models described in the medical literature 
and did not account for those described elsewhere.
CONCLUSIONS: Greater involvement of dermatologists is needed in thinking through 
issues in data collection, data set biases, and applications of technology. 
Dermatologists can provide access to large, diverse data sets that are 
increasingly important for building these models.

Visual-Textual Hybrid Sequence Matching for Joint Reasoning.

Huang X, Peng Y, Wen Z.

Reasoning is one of the central topics in artificial intelligence. As an 
important reasoning paradigm, entailment recognition has attracted much research 
interest, which judges if a hypothesis can be inferred from given premises. 
However, existing research mainly focuses on text-based analysis, that is, 
recognizing textual entailment (RTE), which limits its depth and width. 
Actually, the knowledge and inference process of human are across different 
sensory organs like language and vision, with unique perspectives to represent 
complementary reasoning cues. It is significant to extend existing entailment 
recognition research to cross-media scenarios, that is, recognizing cross-media 
entailment (RCE). Therefore, this article focuses on one representative RCE 
task: visual-textual reasoning, and proposes the visual-textual hybrid sequence 
matching (VHSM) approach. VHSM can reason from image-text premises to text 
hypotheses, whose contributions are: 1) visual-textual hybrid multicontext 
inference is proposed to address RCE via matching with hybrid context 
embeddings, along with adaptive gated aggregation to obtain the final prediction 
results. It can fully exploit complementary visual-textual cue interaction 
during joint reasoning; 2) memory attention-based context embedding is proposed 
to sequentially encode hybrid context embeddings, with the memory attention 
networks to compare neighboring time-steps. This can capture the important 
memory dimensions by coefficient assignment, which fully exploits the 
visual-textual context correlation; and 3) cross-task and visual-textual 
transfer strategy is further proposed to enrich correlation training information 
for boosting reasoning accuracy, which transfers knowledge not only from 
cross-media retrieval task to RCE but also between corresponding text and image 
premises. The experimental results of recognizing visual-textual entailment task 
on the SNLI dataset verify the effectiveness of VHSM.

Objective. To assess the impact of a computerized system on physicians' accuracy 
and agreement rate, as compared with unaided diagnosis. Methods. A set of 124 
unilateral knee radiographs from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) study were 
analyzed by a computerized method with regard to Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grade, 
as well as joint space narrowing, osteophytes, and sclerosis Osteoarthritis 
Research Society International (OARSI) grades. Physicians scored all images, 
with regard to osteophytes, sclerosis, joint space narrowing OARSI grades and KL 
grade, in 2 modalities: through a plain radiograph (unaided) and a radiograph 
presented together with the report from the computer assisted detection system 
(aided). Intraclass correlation between the physicians was calculated for both 
modalities. Furthermore, physicians' performance was compared with the grading 
of the OAI study, and accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated in 
both modalities for each of the scored features. Results. Agreement rates for KL 
grade, sclerosis, and osteophyte OARSI grades, were statistically increased in 
the aided versus the unaided modality. Readings for joint space narrowing OARSI 
grade did not show a statistically difference between the 2 modalities. Readers' 
accuracy and specificity for KL grade >0, KL >1, sclerosis OARSI grade >0, and 
osteophyte OARSI grade >0 was significantly increased in the aided modality. 
Reader sensitivity was high in both modalities. Conclusions. These results show 
that the use of an automated knee OA software increases consistency between 
physicians when grading radiographic features of OA. The use of the software 
also increased accuracy measures as compared with the OAI study, mostly through 
increases in specificity.
