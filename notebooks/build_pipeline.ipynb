Those who connect AI with the world of science fiction may meet its growing rise with hesitancy or outright skepticism. However, AI is becoming increasingly pervasive in our society, from algorithms helping to sift through airline fares to substituting words in emails and SMS text messages based on user choices. Data collection is ongoing and is being leveraged by software platforms to analyze patterns and make predictions across multiple industries. Health care is gradually becoming part of this technological transformation, as advancements in computational power and storage converge with the rapid expansion of digitized medical information. Given the growing and inevitable integration of AI into health care systems, it is our viewpoint that pediatricians urgently require training and orientation to the uses, promises, and pitfalls of AI in medicine. AI is unlikely to solve the full array of complex challenges confronting pediatricians today; however, if used responsibly, it holds great potential to improve many aspects of care for providers, children, and families.

The new ability of ChatGPT-4 (OpenAI) to interpret ophthalmic images has not yet been explored. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance of the novel release of an artificial intelligence chatbot that is capable of processing imaging data. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study used a publicly available dataset of ophthalmic cases from OCTCases, a medical education platform based out of the Department of Ophthalmology and Vision Sciences at the University of Toronto, with accompanying clinical multimodal imaging and multiple-choice questions. Across 137 available cases, 136 contained multiple-choice questions (99%). EXPOSURES: The chatbot answered questions requiring multimodal input from October 16 to October 23, 2023. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the accuracy of the chatbot in answering multiple-choice questions pertaining to image recognition in ophthalmic cases, measured as the proportion of correct responses. chi2 Tests were conducted to compare the proportion of correct responses across different ophthalmic subspecialties. RESULTS: A total of 429 multiple-choice questions from 136 ophthalmic cases and 448 images were included in the analysis. The chatbot answered 299 of multiple-choice questions correctly across all cases (70%). The chatbot's performance was better on retina questions than neuro-ophthalmology questions (77% vs 58%; difference = 18%; 95% CI, 7.5%-29.4%; chi21 = 11.4; P < .001). The chatbot achieved a better performance on nonimage-based questions compared with image-based questions (82% vs 65%; difference = 17%; 95% CI, 7.8%-25.1%; chi21 = 12.2; P < .001).The chatbot performed best on questions in the retina category (77% correct) and poorest in the neuro-ophthalmology category (58% correct). The chatbot demonstrated intermediate performance on questions from the ocular oncology (72% correct), pediatric ophthalmology (68% correct), uveitis (67% correct), and glaucoma (61% correct) categories. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, the recent version of the chatbot accurately responded to approximately two-thirds of multiple-choice questions pertaining to ophthalmic cases based on imaging interpretation. The multimodal chatbot performed better on questions that did not rely on the interpretation of imaging modalities.

This class of inherited disorders, which mimics infection, can result in systemic injury and severe neurologic outcomes. The most common of these disorders is Aicardi Goutieres syndrome (AGS). AGS results in a phenotype similar to \"TORCH\" infections (Toxoplasma gondii, Other [Zika virus (ZIKV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)], Rubella virus, human Cytomegalovirus [HCMV], and Herpesviruses), but with sustained inflammation and ongoing potential for complications. AGS was first described in the early 1980s as familial clusters of \"TORCH\" infections, with severe neurology impairment, microcephaly, and basal ganglia calcifications (Aicardi & Goutieres, Ann Neurol, 1984;15:49-54) and was associated with chronic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lymphocytosis and elevated type I interferon levels (Goutieres et al., Ann Neurol, 1998;44:900-907). Since its first description, the clinical spectrum of AGS has dramatically expanded from the initial cohorts of children with severe impairment to including individuals with average intelligence and mild spastic paraparesis. This broad spectrum of potential clinical manifestations can result in a delayed diagnosis, which families cite as a major stressor.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been used previously in the field of gene expression data, but never adopted for the detection and classification of bacterial ARG. We hypothesize, if the data is correctly conferred, right features are selected, and Deep Learning (DL) classification models are optimized, then (i) non-linear DL models would perform better than Machine Learning (ML) models, (ii) leads to higher accuracy, (iii) can identify the hub genes, and, (iv) can identify gene pathways accurately. We have therefore designed aiGeneR, the first of its kind system that uses DL-based models to identify ARG in E. coli in gene expression data. METHODOLOGY: The aiGeneR consists of a tandem connection of quality control embedded with feature extraction and AI-based classification of ARG. We adopted a cross-validation approach to evaluate the performance of aiGeneR using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Further, we analyzed the effect of sample size ensuring generalization of models and compare against the power analysis. The aiGeneR was validated scientifically and biologically for hub genes and pathways. We benchmarked aiGeneR against two linear and two other non-linear AI models.

The Gini coefficient is a statistical instrument used by nations to measure income inequality, economic status, and social disparity, as escalated income inequality often parallels high poverty rates. Despite its standard annual computation, impeded by logistical hurdles and the gradual transformation of income inequality, we suggest that short-term forecasting of the Gini coefficient could offer instantaneous comprehension of shifts in income inequality during swift transitions, such as variances due to seasonal employment patterns in the expanding gig economy. System Identification (SI), a methodology utilized in domains like engineering and mathematical modeling to construct or refine dynamic system models from captured data, relies significantly on the Nonlinear Auto-Regressive (NAR) model due to its reliability and capability of integrating nonlinear functions, complemented by contemporary machine learning strategies and computational algorithms to approximate complex system dynamics to address these limitations. In this study, we introduce a NAR Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) approach for brief term estimation of the Gini coefficient. Several parameters were tested to discover the optimal model for Malaysia's Gini coefficient within 1987-2015, namely the output lag space, hidden units, and initial random seeds. The One-Step-Ahead (OSA), residual correlation, and residual histograms were used to test the validity of the model. The results demonstrate the model's efficacy over a 28-year period with superior model fit (MSE: 1.14 x 10(-7)) and uncorrelated residuals, thereby substantiating the model's validity and usefulness for predicting short-term variations in much smaller time steps compared to traditional manual approaches.\", metadata={'PMID': '38420485', 'TI': 'Short-term Gini coefficient estimation using nonlinear autoregressive multilayer perceptron model.', 'FAU': 'Amin Megat Ali, Megat Syahirul Zabidi, Azlee Md Tahir, Nooritawati Mohd Yassin, Ihsan Eskandari, Farzad Saadon, Azlinda Taib, Mohd Nasir Ridzuan, Abdul Rahim', 'AU': 'Amin Megat Ali MS Zabidi A Md Tahir N Mohd Yassin I Eskandari F Saadon A Taib MN Ridzuan AR', 'DP': Timestamp('2024-02-29 00:00:00'), 'MH': 'None', 'OT': 'Artificial intelligence Forecasting Gini coefficient Poverty System identification', 'PL': 'England', 'JT': 'Heliyon', 'PMC': 'PMC10901000', 'EDAT': NaT, 'MHDA': NaT, 'STAT': 'PubMed-not-MEDLINE'}),\n",

A study, 'The Global Burden of Disease,' reported 4,506,193 deaths were caused by outdoor air pollution in 2019 [22,25]. The air pollution problem is become even more apparent when it comes to developing countries [22], including Thailand, which is considered one of the developing countries [26]. In this research, we focus and analyze the air pollution in Thailand, which has the annual average PM2.5 (particulate matter 2.5) concentration falls in between 15 and 25, classified as the interim target 2 by 2021's WHO AQG (World Health Organization's Air Quality Guidelines) [27]. (The interim targets refer to areas where the air pollutants concentration is high, with 1 being the highest concentration and decreasing down to 4 [27,28]). However, the methodology proposed here can also be adopted in other areas as well. During the winter in Thailand, Bangkok and its surrounding metroplex have been facing the issue of air pollution (e.g., PM2.5) every year. Currently, air quality measurement is done by simply implementing physical air quality measurement devices at designated-but limited number of locations. In this work, we propose a method that allows us to estimate the Air Quality Index (AQI) on a larger scale by utilizing Landsat 8 images with machine learning techniques. We propose and compare hybrid models with pure regression models to enhance AQI prediction based on satellite images. Our hybrid model consists of two parts as follows:*The classification part and the estimation part, whereas the pure regressor model consists of only one part, which is a pure regression model for AQI estimation.*The two parts of the hybrid model work hand in hand such that the classification part classifies data points into each class of air quality standard, which is then passed to the estimation part to estimate the final AQI. From our experiments, after considering all factors and comparing their performances, we conclude that the hybrid model has a slightly better performance than the pure regressor model, although both models can achieve a generally minimum R(2) (R(2) > 0.7). We also introduced and tested an additional factor, DOY (day of year), and incorporated it into our model. Additional experiments with similar approaches are also performed and compared.

As the space where residents stay for the longest time and have the most profound impact on their physical and mental health, the quality of the environment in urban communities largely determines the degree to which residents engage in physical activity, bear the risk of pollution exposure, and obtain healthy food. Therefore, in order to ensure the physical and mental health of residents, this study proposes community planning guided by environmental hygiene and public health, and establishes an environmental health assessment system for this purpose. This system evaluates the community environment from four aspects: land use, service facilities, site convenience, and environmental quality. Established the diversity, density, road network connectivity and facilities accessibility nine criteria, as well as the land function of mix, plot ratio, food environment, network ring alpha and connected beta index, pavement risk level, green configuration and neighborhood material environment disorder degree of 27 indicators of community built environmental evaluation index system. The data is collected through field survey, questionnaire distribution, resident interview and data mapping, and the established evaluation index system is used to evaluate the construction environment of the community. The experimental research data included population data, CAD plan, land use data, street data, POI point data, building data and bus station data, etc. 273 questionnaires were distributed, 264 were recovered, 8 invalid questionnaires were removed, and 256 valid questionnaires were obtained. These experiments confirm that land use, service facilities, site convenience, and environmental quality have a significant impact on the built environment of communities, with impact weights of 0.513, 0.227, 0.135, and 0.125, respectively. The above weights are calculated based on the index judgment matrix and the eigenvectors.

Therefore, community planning and transformation based on land use, service facilities, venue convenience, and environmental quality can effectively improve the physical and mental health of residents. In the specific community transformation plan, artificial intelligence and data-driven methods can be used to optimize the land use plan, service facility configuration, site convenience transformation and environmental quality improvement, so as to formulate the optimal community transformation plan and improve the comfort and happiness of community residents.

However, biomechanical data are frequently limited due to diverse challenges. Effective methods for augmenting data in developing ML models, specifically in the human posture domain, are scarce. Therefore, this study explored the feasibility of leveraging generative artificial intelligence (AI) to produce realistic synthetic posture data by utilizing three-dimensional posture data. Methods: Data were collected from 338 subjects through surface topography. A Variational Autoencoder (VAE) architecture was employed to generate and evaluate synthetic posture data, examining its distinguishability from real data by domain experts, ML classifiers, and Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM). The benefits of incorporating augmented posture data into the learning process were exemplified by a deep autoencoder (AE) for automated feature representation. Results: Our findings highlight the challenge of differentiating synthetic data from real data for both experts and ML classifiers, underscoring the quality of synthetic data.

METHODS: 168 head CT scans of patients after cardiac arrest were retrospectively identified and classified into two categories: 88 (52.4%) with radiological evidence of severe HIE and 80 (47.6%) without signs of HIE. These images were randomly divided into a training and a test set, and five deep learning models based on based on Densely Connected Convolutional Networks (DenseNet121) were trained and validated using different image input formats (2D and 3D images). RESULTS: All optimized stacked 2D and 3D networks could detect signs of HIE. The networks based on the data as 2D image data stacks provided the best results (S100: AUC: 94%, ACC: 79%, S50: AUC: 93%, ACC: 79%).

In the present work, a multi-hybrid DE (MHDE) is proposed for improving the overall working capability of the algorithm without compromising the solution quality. Adaptive parameters, enhanced mutation, enhanced crossover, reducing population, iterative division and Gaussian random sampling are some of the major characteristics of the proposed MHDE algorithm. Firstly, an iterative division for improved exploration and exploitation is used, then an adaptive proportional population size reduction mechanism is followed for reducing the computational complexity. It also incorporated Weibull distribution and Gaussian random sampling to mitigate premature convergence. The proposed framework is validated by using IEEE CEC benchmark suites (CEC 2005, CEC 2014 and CEC 2017). The algorithm is applied to four engineering design problems and for the weight minimization of three frame design problems. Experimental results are analysed and compared with recent hybrid algorithms such as laplacian biogeography based optimization, adaptive differential evolution with archive (JADE), success history based DE, self adaptive DE, LSHADE, MVMO, fractional-order calculus-based flower pollination algorithm, sine cosine crow search algorithm and others.

Statistical and bibliometric analysis were done to characterise the literature. Softwares used included the R Studio bibliometrix package, and VOSviewer. RESULTS: A total of 3939 articles were included in the final bibliometric analysis. Diabetic retinopathy (391, 6% of the top 100 keywords) was the most frequently occurring indexed keyword by a large margin. The highest impact literature was produced by the least populated countries and in those countries who collaborate internationally. This was confirmed via a hypothesis test where no correlation was found between gross number of published articles and average number of citations (p value=0.866, r=0.038), while graphing ratio of international collaboration against average citations produced a positive correlation (r=0.283). Majority of publications were found to be concentrated in journals specialising in vision and computer science, with this category of journals having the highest number of publications per journal (18.00 publications/journal), though they represented a small proportion of the total journals (<1%).

This systematic review details the use of AI in pediatric surgery. METHODS: Nine medical databases were searched from inception until January 2023, identifying articles focused on AI in pediatric surgery. Two authors reviewed full texts of eligible articles. Studies were included if they were original investigations on the development, validation, or clinical application of AI models for pediatric health conditions primarily managed surgically. Studies were excluded if they were not peer-reviewed, were review articles, editorials, commentaries, or case reports, did not focus on pediatric surgical conditions, or did not employ at least one AI model. Extracted data included study characteristics, clinical specialty, AI method and algorithm type, AI model (algorithm) role and performance metrics, key results, interpretability, validation, and risk of bias using PROBAST and QUADAS-2. RESULTS: Authors screened 8178 articles and included 112. Half of the studies (50%) reported predictive models (for adverse events [25%], surgical outcomes [16%] and survival [9%]), followed by diagnostic (29%) and decision support models (21%). Neural networks (44%) and ensemble learners (36%) were the most commonly used AI methods across application domains. The main pediatric surgical subspecialties represented across all models were general surgery (31%) and neurosurgery (25%). Forty-four percent of models were interpretable, and 6% were both interpretable and externally validated. Forty percent of models had a high risk of bias, and concerns over applicability were identified in 7%. CONCLUSIONS: While AI has wide potential clinical applications in pediatric surgery, very few published AI algorithms were externally validated, interpretable, and unbiased.

Their ability to acquire and maintain functional vascularization is currently debated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the vascularization induced by two collagen-based scaffolds (with 2D and 3D structures) and one non-collagen scaffold implanted on the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Classical stereomicroscopic image vascular assessment was enhanced with the IKOSA software by using two applications: the CAM assay and the Network Formation Assay, evaluating the vessel branching potential, vascular area, as well as tube length and thickness. RESULTS: Both collagen-based scaffolds induced non-inflammatory angiogenesis, but the non-collagen scaffold induced a massive inflammation followed by inflammatory-related angiogenesis. Vessels branching points/Region of Interest (Px;2) and Vessel branching points/Vessel total area (Px;2), increased exponentially until day 5 of the experiment certifying a sustained and continuous angiogenic process induced by 3D collagen scaffolds. CONCLUSION: Collagen-based scaffolds may be more suitable for neovascularization compared to non-collagen scaffolds.

It is vital to recognize and detect the type of arrhythmia for monitoring cardiac abnormalities. The AI-based ECG beat classification algorithms proposed in the literature suffer from two main drawbacks. Firstly, some of the works have not considered any unseen test data to validate the performance of their algorithms. Secondly, the accuracy of detecting superventricular ectopic beats (SVEB) needs to be improved. In this work, we address these issues by considering an inter-patient paradigm where the test dataset is collected from a different set of subjects than the training data. Also, the proposed methodology detects SVEB with an F1 score of 89.35%, which is better than existing algorithms. We have used the Fourier decomposition method (FDM) for multi-scale analysis of ECG signals and extracted time-domain and statistical features from the narrow-band signal components obtained using FDM. Feature selection techniques, including the Kruskal-Wallis test and minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) have been used to select only the relevant features and rank these features to remove any redundancy. Since the dataset used is highly imbalanced, Mathew's correlation coefficient (MCC) has also been used to analyze the performance of the proposed method.

Arterial calcification and non-compressibility may limit test interpretation in this population. Developing tools capable of identifying PAD and predicting major adverse cardiac (MACE) and limb (MALE) outcomes among diabetic patients would be clinically useful. Deep neural network analysis of resting Doppler arterial waveforms was used to detect PAD among diabetic patients and to identify those at greatest risk for major adverse outcome events. METHODS: Consecutive diabetic patients undergoing lower limb arterial testing (4/1/2015-12/30/2020) were randomly allocated to training, validation and testing subsets (60%/20%/20%). Deep neural networks were trained on resting posterior tibial arterial Doppler waveforms to predict all-cause mortality, MACE and MALE at 5 years using quartiles based on the distribution of the prediction score. RESULTS: Among 11,384 total patients, 4,211 patients with DM met study criteria (mean age 68.6+/-11.9 years; 32.0% female).

       " Document(page_content=\"pH fluctuations within the extracellular matrix (ECM) and its principal constituent collagen, particularly in solid tumors and chronic wounds, may influence its structure and function. Whereas previous research examined the impact of pH on collagen fibrillogenesis, this study focuses on determining how pH fluctuations affect collagen hydrogels that mimic the physiological ECM. Utilizing a type I collagen hydrogel, we examined the influence of pH fluctuations on its structure, properties, and function while keeping the collagen hydrated. We show that collagen's secondary structure remains unaltered during pathologically relevant microenvironmental pH changes. By employing cryo Scanning Electron Microscopy and Artificial Intelligence-assisted image analysis, we show that at physiological pH, collagen hydrogel presents densely packed, aligned, and elongated fibrils, which upon a decrease to pH 6.5, are transformed into shorter, sparser, and disoriented fibrils. The collagen possesses a higher storage modulus yet a lower permeability at pH 7 and 7.8 compared with pH 6.5 and 7.4. Exposing acidified collagen to a basic buffer reinstates its native structure and viscoelastic properties. Our study offers an innovative approach to analyze and characterize perturbations in hydrated collagen-based systems with potential implications for better understanding and combating disease progression. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: As the main component of the extracellular matrix, collagen undergoes conformational changes associated with pH changes during disease. We analyze the impact of pH on pre-formed collagen fibers mimicking healthy tissues subjected to disease, and do not focus on the more studied fibrillogenesis process. Using cryogenic SEM, which allowed imaging close to the native state, we show that even minor fluctuations in the pH affect the collagen thickness, length, fiber alignment, and rheological properties. Following exposure to acidic pH, the collagen had short fibers, lacked orientation, and had low mechanical strength. This acidic collagen restored its original properties after returning to a neutral pH. These findings can help determine how pH changes can be modulated to restore healthy collagen properties.\", metadata={'PMID': '38417647', 'TI': 'Multimodal characterization of the collagen hydrogel structure and properties in response to physiologically relevant pH fluctuations.', 'FAU': 'Shtrauchler, Orit Bronner Nativ-Roth, Einat Sanchez, Daniel Sevilla Zaiden, Michal Vidavsky, Netta', 'AU': 'Shtrauchler OB Nativ-Roth E Sanchez DS Zaiden M Vidavsky N', 'DP': Timestamp('2024-02-26 00:00:00'), 'MH': 'None', 'OT': 'ATR-FTIR Cryo Scanning Electron Microscopy Extracellular matrix Tumor microenvironment', 'PL': 'England', 'JT': 'Acta biomaterialia', 'PMC': 'None', 'EDAT': NaT, 'MHDA': NaT, 'STAT': 'Publisher'}),\n",

Challenges in this field have included the lack of tools and large, heterogenous datasets to interrogate the association between muscle health and BP. Computer-vision models have been transformative in this space, enabling the automated quantification of muscle health and the processing of large datasets. PURPOSE: To investigate the associations between lumbar paraspinal muscle health and age, sex, BMI, physical activity, and BP in a large, heterogenous dataset using an automated computer-vision model. DESIGN: Cross-sectional Study PATIENT SAMPLE: Participants from the UK Biobank with abdominal Dixon fat-water MRI (N=9,564) were included (41.8% women; mean (SD) 63.5 (7.6) years; BMI: 26.4 (4.1) kg/m(2)) of whom 6,953 reported no pain, 930 acute BP, and 1,681 chronic BP. OUTCOME MEASURES: Intramuscular fat (IMF) and average cross-sectional area (aCSA) were automatically derived using a computer-vision model for the left and right lumbar multifidus (LM), erector spinae (ES), and psoas major (PM) from the L1 to L5 vertebral levels. METHODS: Two-tailed partial Pearson correlations were generated for each muscle to assess the relationships between the muscle measures (IMF and aCSA) and age (controlling for BMI, sex, and physical activity), BMI (controlling for age, sex, and physical activity), and physical activity (controlling for age, sex, and BMI). One-way ANCOVA was used to identify sex differences in IMF and aCSA for each muscle while controlling for age, BMI, and physical activity. Similarly, one-way ANCOVA was used to identify between-group differences (no pain, acute BP, and chronic BP) for each muscle and along the superior-inferior expanse of the lumbar spine while controlling for age, BMI, sex, and physical activity (alpha=0.05). RESULTS: Females had higher IMF (LM mean difference (MD)=11.1%, ES MD=10.2%, PM MD=0.3%, p<0.001) and lower aCSA (LM MD=47.6 mm(2), ES MD=350.0 mm(2), PM MD=321.5 mm(2), p<0.001) for all muscles. Higher age was associated with higher IMF and lower aCSA for all muscles (r>/=0.232, p<0.001) except for LM and aCSA (r</=0.013, p>/=0.267). Higher BMI was associated with higher IMF and aCSA for all muscles (r>/=0.174, p<0.001). Higher physical activity was associated with lower IMF and higher aCSA for all muscles (r>/=0.036, p</=0.002) except for LM and aCSA (r</=0.010, p>/=0.405). People with chronic BP had higher IMF and lower aCSA than people with no pain (IMF MD</=1.6%, aCSA MD</=27.4 mm(2), p<0.001) and higher IMF compared to acute BP (IMF MD</=1.1%, p<0.001). The differences between people with BP and people with no pain were not spatially localized to the inferior lumbar levels but broadly distributed across the lumbar spine. CONCLUSIONS: Paraspinal muscle health is associated with age, BMI, sex, and physical activity with the exception of the association between LM aCSA and age and physical activity. People with BP (chronic > acute) have higher IMF and lower aCSA than people reporting no pain. The differences were not localized but broadly distributed across the lumbar spine.

Of course, such characteristics would pose a problem for the medical world, including radiology. The patient journey is filled with explanations along the way, from diagnoses to treatment, follow-up, and more. If we were to replace part of these steps with non-explanatory algorithms, we could lose grip on vital aspects such as finding mistakes, patient trust, and even the creation of new knowledge. In this article, we argue that, even for the darkest of black boxes, there is hope of understanding them. In particular, we compare the situation of understanding black box models to that of understanding the laws of nature in physics. In the case of physics, we are given a 'black box' law of nature, about which there is no upfront explanation. However, as current physical theories show, we can learn plenty about them. During this discussion, we present the process by which we make such explanations and the human role therein, keeping a solid focus on radiological AI situations. We will outline the AI developers' roles in this process, but also the critical role fulfilled by the practitioners, the radiologists, in providing a healthy system of continuous improvement of AI models. Furthermore, we explore the role of the explainable AI (XAI) research program in the broader context we describe.\", metadata={'PMID': '38417186', 'TI': 'Artificial intelligence and explanation: How, why, and when to explain black boxes.', 'FAU': 'Marcus, Eric Teuwen, Jonas', 'AU': 'Marcus E Teuwen J', 'DP': Timestamp('2024-02-23 00:00:00'), 'MH': 'None', 'OT': 'Black Box Explainability Explainable AI Radiology', 'PL': 'Ireland', 'JT': 'European journal of radiology', 'PMC': 'None', 'EDAT': NaT, 'MHDA': NaT, 'STAT': 'Publisher'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"With the rise in vehicle ownership, traffic congestion has emerged as a major barrier to urban progress, making the study and optimization of urban road capacity exceedingly crucial. The research on the medium and long-term free-flowing capacity and queue emission rate of roads takes an in-depth exploration of this issue from a cutting-edge perspective, aiming to find solutions adaptable to the progression of the times. The purpose of this study is to understand and predict the road capacity and queue emission rate more accurately, thus improving the urban traffic condition. Existing literature primarily focuses on short-term forecasts of road capacity, leaving a notable void in the research of medium and long-term road capacity and queue emission rate. This gap often results in a lack of sufficient foresight when urban traffic planning faces practical issues. To fill this void, this study undertook an in-depth examination of the road capacity and queue emission rate over the medium and long term (10 years) based on big data analysis and artificial intelligence theories. This paper employs a Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network, combined with twelve other parameters that could potentially impact road capacity, such as traffic volume, road width, number of lanes, traffic signal control methods, etc., to analyze the relationship between each parameter and free-flow traffic and queue emission rate. These analyses are grounded in extensive road data, encompassing not only the city's main roads but also secondary roads and community roads. The study results show a continuous downward trend in the free-flowing capacity of roads and a slight upward trend in the queue emission rate over the past decade. Further analysis reveals the extent of impact each factor has on the free-flow traffic and queue emission rate, providing a scientific basis for future urban traffic planning.\", metadata={'PMID': '38416787', 'TI': 'Study of medium and long-term free flow capacity and queue discharge rates on roads.', 'FAU': 'Rong, Yi Xue, Zitao', 'AU': 'Rong Y Xue Z', 'DP': NaT, 'MH': 'None', 'OT': 'None', 'PL': 'United States', 'JT': 'PloS one', 'PMC': 'None', 'EDAT': NaT, 'MHDA': NaT, 'STAT': 'In-Process'}),\n",

The Model of End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) is a clinical prediction model based on measurements of bilirubin, creatinine, and the international normalized ratio (INR). This study evaluates the propagation of error through the MELD, to inform choice of APS for the MELD input variables. METHODS: A total of 6093 consecutive MELD scores and underlying analysis results were retrospectively collected. \"Desirable analytical variation\" based on biological variation as well as current local analytical variation was simulated onto the data set as well as onto a constructed data set, representing a worst-case scenario. Resulting changes in MELD score and risk classification were calculated. RESULTS: Biological variation-based APS in the worst-case scenario resulted in 3.26% of scores changing by >/=1 MELD point. In the patient-derived data set, the same variation resulted in 0.92% of samples changing by >/=1 MELD point, and 5.5% of samples changing risk category. Local analytical performance resulted in lower reclassification rates. CONCLUSIONS: Error propagation through MELD is complex and includes population-dependent mechanisms. Biological variation-derived APS were acceptable for all uses of the MELD score. Other combinations of APS can yield equally acceptable results. This analysis exemplifies how error propagation through artificial intelligence models can become highly complex. This complexity will necessitate that both model suppliers and clinical laboratories address analytical performance specifications for the specific use case, as these may differ from performance specifications for traditional use of the analyses.', metadata={'PMID': '38416710', 'TI': 'Analytical Performance Specifications for Input Variables: Investigation of the Model of End-Stage Liver Disease.', 'FAU': 'Andersen, Eline S Rottger, Richard Brasen, Claus L Brandslund, Ivan', 'AU': 'Andersen ES Rottger R Brasen CL Brandslund I', 'DP': Timestamp('2024-02-28 00:00:00'), 'MH': 'None', 'OT': 'None', 'PL': 'England', 'JT': 'Clinical chemistry', 'PMC': 'None', 'EDAT': NaT, 'MHDA': NaT, 'STAT': 'Publisher'}),\n",

We built a deep learning platform (DLP) for automatic detection of 30 fundus diseases using ultra-widefield fluorescein angiography (UWFFA) with deep experts aggregation. METHODS: This retrospective and cross-sectional database study included a total of 61,609 UWFFA images dating from 2016 to 2021, involving more than 3364 subjects in multiple centers across China. All subjects were divided into 30 different groups.

       " Document(page_content=\"Artificial neural networks (ANNs), inspired by the human brain's network of neurons and synapses, enable computing machines and systems to execute cognitive tasks, thus embodying artificial intelligence (AI). Since the performance of ANNs generally improves with the expansion of the network size, and also most of the computation time is spent for matrix operations, AI computation have been performed not only using the general-purpose central processing unit (CPU) but also architectures that facilitate parallel computation, such as graphic processing units (GPUs) and custom-designed application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). Nevertheless, the substantial energy consumption stemming from frequent data transfers between processing units and memory has remained a persistent challenge. In response, a novel approach has emerged: an in-memory computing architecture harnessing analog memory elements. This innovation promises a notable advancement in energy efficiency. The core of this analog AI hardware accelerator lies in expansive arrays of non-volatile memory devices, known as resistive processing units (RPUs). These RPUs facilitate massively parallel matrix operations, leading to significant enhancements in both performance and energy efficiency. Electrochemical random-access memory (ECRAM), leveraging ion dynamics in secondary-ion battery materials, has emerged as a promising candidate for RPUs. ECRAM achieves over 1000 memory states through precise ion movement control, prompting early-stage research into material stacks such as mobile ion species and electrolyte materials. Crucially, the analog states in ECRAMs update symmetrically with pulse number (or voltage polarity), contributing to high network performance. Recent strides in device engineering in planar and three-dimensional structures and the understanding of ECRAM operation physics have marked significant progress in a short research period. This paper aims to review ECRAM material advancements through literature surveys, offering a systematic discussion on engineering assessments for ion control and a physical understanding of array-level demonstrations.

RECENT FINDINGS: Several aspects of the uroflow test in addition to maximum flow rate and uroflow pattern show potential diagnostic utility. This includes flow acceleration, uroflow indices, uroflow-electromyography including lag time, stop uroflow test, and uroflow-based nomograms. There are initial attempts to use artificial intelligence in analysis. There is also new data with regard to factors influencing variability of uroflow testing that might influence the diagnostic value in as yet uncertain ways including diurnal variability, postural variability, locational variability, and operator variability. There are new technologies for uroflow testing in a home environment allowing for easy repetition. However, there are several challenges owing to a paucity of clinical data and standardization.

Manual segmentation on fetal MRI provides a quantitative estimation of total lung volume and liver herniation. However, it is time-consuming and operator-dependent. In this study, we utilized a publicly available deep learning (DL) segmentation system (nnU-Net) to automatically contour CDH-affected fetal lungs and liver on MRI sections. Concordance between automatic and manual segmentation was assessed by calculating the Jaccard coefficient. Pyradiomics standard features were then extracted from both manually and automatically segmented regions. The reproducibility of features between the two groups was evaluated through the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). We finally tested the reliability of the automatic-segmentation approach by building a ML classifier system for the prediction of liver herniation based on support vector machines (SVM) and trained on shape features computed both in the manual and nnU-Net-segmented organs. We compared the area under the classifier receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in the two cases. Pyradiomics features calculated in the manual ROIs were partly reproducible by the same features calculated in nnU-Net segmented ROIs and, when used in the ML procedure, to predict liver herniation (both AUC around 0.85).

The differentiation of the cells on a scaffold is impacted among other factors by the surface deformation of the scaffold due to mechanical loading and the wall shear stresses imposed by the interstitial fluid flow.

In this work, a numerical framework is proposed to study the influence of these factors on the expected osteochondral cell differentiation. The considered scaffold is rectangular with a 0/90 lay-down pattern and a four-layered strut made of polylactic acid with a 5% steel particle content. The distribution of the different types of cells on the scaffold surface is estimated through a scalar stimulus, calculated by using a mechanobioregulatory model. To reduce the simulation time for the computation of the stimulus, a probabilistic machine learning (ML)-based reduced-order model (ROM) is proposed. Then, a sensitivity analysis is performed using the Shapley additive explanations to examine the contribution of the various parameters to the framework stimulus predictions. In a final step, a multiobjective optimization procedure is implemented using genetic algorithms and the ROM, aiming to identify the material parameters and loading conditions that maximize the percentage of surface area populated by bone cells while minimizing the area corresponding to the other types of cells and the resorption condition.

Coronary CT angiograms (n = 566) were used to derive synthetic data for training. Deep learning-based image denoising (DLID) was compared with unprocessed images and a standard noise reduction algorithm (BM3D). Noise and signal-to-noise ratio measurements, as well as expert evaluation of image quality were performed. To validate the use of the denoised images for cardiac quantification, threshold-based segmentation was performed, and results were compared with manual measurements on unprocessed images. Deep learning-based denoised images showed significantly improved noise compared with standard denoising-based images (SD of left ventricular blood pool, 20.3 +/- 42.5 HU versus 33.4 +/- 39.8 HU for DLID versus BM3D, P < .0001). Expert evaluations of image quality were significantly higher in deep learningbased denoised images compared with standard denoising. Semiautomatic left ventricular size measurements on deep learning-based denoised images showed excellent correlation with expert quantification on unprocessed images (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.97).

However, achieving low monitoring limits, a wide detection range, large bending stresses, and excellent mechanical stability simultaneously remains a serious challenge. With the aim of developing a high-performance capacitive pressure sensor (CPS), this paper introduces the successful preparation of a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT)/polydimethylsiloxane (S-PDMS) composite dielectric with a foam-like structure (high permittivity and low elasticity modulus) and MXene/SWNT (S-MXene) composite film electrodes with a micro-crumpled structure. The above structurally modified CPS (SMCPS) demonstrated an excellent response output during pressure loading, achieving a wide pressure detection range (up to 700 kPa), a low detection limit (16.55 Pa), fast response/recovery characteristics (48/60 ms), enhanced sensitivity across a wide pressure range, long-term stability under repeated heavy loading and unloading (40 kPa, >2000 cycles), and reliable performance under various temperature and humidity conditions.

METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on 543 mammograms of 467 Malays, 48 Chinese, and 28 Indians in a middle-income nation. Three breast radiologists interpreted the examinations independently in two reading sessions (with and without AI support). Breast density and BI-RADS categories were assessed, comparing the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) results. RESULTS: Of 543 mammograms, 69.2% had lesions detected. Biopsies were performed on 25%(n=136), with 66(48.5%) benign and 70(51.5%) malignant. Substantial agreement in density assessment between the radiologist and AI software (kappa =0.606, p < 0.001) and the BI-RADS category with and without AI (kappa =0.74, p < 0.001). The performance of the AI software was comparable to the traditional methods. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV or radiologists alone, radiologist + AI, and AI alone were 81.9%,90.4%,56.0%, and 97.1%; 81.0%, 93.1%,55.5%, and 97.0%; and 90.0%,76.5%,36.2%, and 98.1%, respectively. AI software enhances the accuracy of lesion diagnosis and reduces unnecessary biopsies, particularly for BI-RADS 4 lesions. The AI software results for synthetic were almost similar to the original 2D mammography, with AUC of 0.925 and 0.871, respectively.

Deep learning, one of the most widely used forms of artificial intelligence (AI), is now commonly employed in medical imaging for fracture detection. This study aimed to construct a deep learning model using big data to recognize multiple-fracture X-ray images of extremity bones. METHODS: Radiographic imaging data of extremities were retrospectively collected from five hospitals between January 2017 and September 2020. The total number of people finally included was 25,635 and the total number of images included was 26,098. After labeling the lesions, the randomized method used 90% of the data as the training set to develop the fracture detection model, and the remaining 10% was used as the validation set to verify the model. The faster region convolutional neural networks (R-CNN) algorithm was adopted to construct diagnostic models for detection. The Dice coefficient was used to evaluate the image segmentation accuracy. The performances of detection models were evaluated with sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). RESULTS: The free-response receiver operating characteristic (FROC) curve value was 0.886 and 0.843 for the detection of single and multiple fractures, respectively. Additionally, the effective identification AUC for all parts was higher than 0.920. Notably, the AUC for wrist fractures reached 0.952. The average accuracy in detecting bone fracture regions in the extremities was 0.865. When analyzing single and multiple lesions at the patient level, the sensitivity was 0.957 for patients with multiple lesions and 0.852 for those with single lesions.

In this context, it is crucial to understand the pro-environmental behavior of adolescents, as young people play a fundamental role in facilitating long-term changes in environmental consciousness and encouraging decision-makers to take action. However, little is currently known about the pro-environmental behavior of adolescents. Recently, there has been growing interest in examining the influence of personality traits and emotional intelligence on pro-environmental behavior. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review to enhance our understanding of adolescent pro-environmental behavior. Thus, this systematic review was designed to enhance understanding of adolescent's pro-environmental behavior by summarizing existing evidence on how it relates to personality and emotional intelligence.

Using the testing dataset for each image, the algorithm outputted a numerical value from 0 to 1 (the probability of the pulmonary arterial hypertension score). The training process employed a binary cross-entropy loss function with stochastic gradient descent optimization (learning rate parameter, alpha = 0.01). In addition, using the same testing dataset, the algorithm's ability to identify pulmonary arterial hypertension was compared with that of experienced doctors. RESULTS: The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve for the detection ability of the algorithm was 0.988.

Paranasal sinuses like frontal and maxillary sinuses, are resistant to trauma and can aid profiling. We developed a deep learning (DL) model optimized by an evolutionary algorithm (genetic algorithm/GA) to determine sex and age using paranasal sinus parameters based on cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). METHODS: Two hundred and forty CBCT images (including 129 females and 111 males, aged 18-52) were included in this study. CBCT images were captured using the Newtom3G device with specific exposure parameters. These images were then analyzed in ITK-SNAP 3.6.0 beta software to extract four paranasal sinus parameters: height, width, length, and volume for both the frontal and maxillary sinuses. A hybrid model, Genetic Algorithm-Deep Neural Network (GADNN), was proposed for feature selection and classification. Traditional statistical methods and machine learning models, including logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), multilayer perceptron neural network (MLP), and deep learning (DL) were evaluated for their performance. The synthetic minority oversampling technique was used to deal with the unbalanced data. RESULTS: GADNN showed superior accuracy in both sex determination (accuracy of 86%) and age determination (accuracy of 68%), outperforming other models. Also, DL and RF were the second and third superior methods in sex determination (accuracy of 78% and 71% respectively) and age determination (accuracy of 92% and 57%).

METHODS: Thoracic and lumbar spine radiographs with inquiries for fracture were retrospectively collected and analyzed by the AI. The presence or absence of fracture was defined by the written report or cross-sectional imaging where available. Fractures were classified semi-quantitatively by the Genant classification, by acuity, by the presence of foreign material, and overall degree of degenerative change of the spine.

Therefore, this study aimed to develop a real-time deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) system to assess the Forrest classification of peptic ulcer bleeding (PUB). METHODS: A training dataset (3868 endoscopic images) and an internal validation dataset (834 images) were retrospectively collected from the 900th Hospital, Fuzhou, China. In addition, 521 images collected from four other hospitals were used for external validation. Finally, 46 endoscopic videos were prospectively collected to assess the real-time diagnostic performance of the DCNN system, whose diagnostic performance was also prospectively compared with that of three senior and three junior endoscopists. RESULTS: The DCNN system had a satisfactory diagnostic performance in the assessment of Forrest classification, with an accuracy of 91.2% (95%CI 89.5%-92.6%) and a macro-average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.80 in the validation dataset. Moreover, the DCNN system could judge suspicious regions automatically using Forrest classification in real-time videos, with an accuracy of 92.0% (95%CI 80.8%-97.8%). The DCNN system showed more accurate and stable diagnostic performance than endoscopists in the prospective clinical comparison test. This system helped to slightly improve the diagnostic performance of senior endoscopists and considerably enhance that of junior endoscopists.

       " Document(page_content=\"OBJECTIVES: While C-reactive protein (CRP) has been solidly linked as a risk factor for cognitive impairment, observational research alone cannot definitively demonstrate a causal relationship. This study therefore sought to determine whether there was an association between CRP and the development of cognitive impairment. METHODS: This study employed bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate the genetic association between CRP and cognitive impairment. genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics for both were sourced from IEU Open GWAS or prior reports. Cognitive GWAS's used were on tests designed to assess cognitive performance, fluid intelligence, prospective memory, and reaction time. The MR analysis applied several methods, including inverse variance-weighted (IVW), MR Egger, weighted median, simple mode, and weighted mode approaches, then use of MR sensitivity analyses to interrogate findings. RESULTS: Forward MR analysis showed that genetically proxied CRP was associated with prospective memory (P = 0.009), whereas there is little evidence to support an association between CRP and other cognitive tests. Reverse MR analysis indicated a potential association between genetic proxy cognitive performance (P = 0.002) and fluid intelligence score (P = 0.019) with CRP levels. For genetically proxied CRP on prospective memory, the level of pleiotropy (P > 0.05) and no genetic variant heterogeneity (P > 0.05) made bias unlikely, and leave-one-out tests also confirmed robust associations.

To compare human and computer attention, we performed eye-tracking analyses of geneticist clinicians (n = 22) and non-clinicians (n = 22) who viewed images of people with 10 different genetic conditions, as well as images of unaffected individuals. We calculated the Intersection-over-Union (IoU) and Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL) to compare the visual attentions of the two participant groups, and then the clinician group against the saliency maps of our deep learning classifier. We found that human visual attention differs greatly from DL model's saliency results. Averaging over all the test images, IoU and KL metric for the successful (accurate) clinician visual attentions versus the saliency maps were 0.15 and 11.15, respectively. Individuals also tend to have a specific pattern of image inspection, and clinicians demonstrate different visual attention patterns than non-clinicians (IoU and KL of clinicians versus non-clinicians were 0.47 and 2.73, respectively).

They have the potential to improve access to mental health interventions through automated, scalable, and personalized delivery of psychotherapeutic content. However, digital health interventions, including those delivered by CAs, often have high attrition rates. Identifying the factors associated with attrition is critical to improving future clinical trials. OBJECTIVE: This review aims to estimate the overall and differential rates of attrition in CA-delivered mental health interventions (CA interventions), evaluate the impact of study design and intervention-related aspects on attrition, and describe study design features aimed at reducing or mitigating study attrition. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science, and conducted a gray literature search on Google Scholar in June 2022. We included randomized controlled trials that compared CA interventions against control groups and excluded studies that lasted for 1 session only and used Wizard of Oz interventions. We also assessed the risk of bias in the included studies using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool 2.0. Random-effects proportional meta-analysis was applied to calculate the pooled dropout rates in the intervention groups. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to compare the attrition rate in the intervention groups with that in the control groups. We used a narrative review to summarize the findings. RESULTS: The systematic search retrieved 4566 records from peer-reviewed databases and citation searches, of which 41 (0.90%) randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. The meta-analytic overall attrition rate in the intervention group was 21.84% (95% CI 16.74%-27.36%; I(2)=94%). Short-term studies that lasted </=8 weeks showed a lower attrition rate (18.05%, 95% CI 9.91%- 27.76%; I(2)=94.6%) than long-term studies that lasted >8 weeks (26.59%, 95% CI 20.09%-33.63%; I(2)=93.89%). Intervention group participants were more likely to attrit than control group participants for short-term (log odds ratio 1.22, 95% CI 0.99-1.50; I(2)=21.89%) and long-term studies (log odds ratio 1.33, 95% CI 1.08-1.65; I(2)=49.43%). Intervention-related characteristics associated with higher attrition include stand-alone CA interventions without human support, not having a symptom tracker feature, no visual representation of the CA, and comparing CA interventions with waitlist controls. No participant-level factor reliably predicted attrition. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that approximately one-fifth of the participants will drop out from CA interventions in short-term studies. High heterogeneities made it difficult to generalize the findings. Our results suggested that future CA interventions should adopt a blended design with human support, use symptom tracking, compare CA intervention groups against active controls rather than waitlist controls, and include a visual representation of the CA to reduce the attrition rate.

Concerns emerged regarding AI's potential to automate researcher tasks, particularly in language editing, statistics, and data analysis. Additionally, roughly half expressed ethical concerns about using AI applications in scientific research. CONCLUSION: The increasing use of chatbots in academic research necessitates thoughtful regulation that balances potential benefits with inherent limitations and potential risks. Chatbots should not be considered authors of scientific publications but rather assistants to researchers during manuscript preparation and review. Researchers should be equipped with proper training to utilize chatbots and other AI tools effectively and ethically.\", metadata={'PMID': '38411833', 'TI': 'Knowledge, Perceptions and Attitude of Researchers Towards Using ChatGPT in Research.', 'FAU': 'Abdelhafiz, Ahmed Samir Ali, Asmaa Maaly, Ayman Mohamed Ziady, Hany Hassan Sultan, Eman Anwar Mahgoub, Mohamed Anwar', 'AU': 'Abdelhafiz AS Ali A Maaly AM Ziady HH Sultan EA Mahgoub MA', 'DP': Timestamp('2024-02-27 00:00:00'), 'MH': 'Humans Female Male *Artificial Intelligence *Data Analysis Knowledge Language Software', 'OT': 'Academic Research Artificial Intelligence ChatGPT Chatbots ELSI', 'PL': 'United States', 'JT': 'Journal of medical systems', 'PMC': 'PMC10899415', 'EDAT': NaT, 'MHDA': NaT, 'STAT': 'MEDLINE'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='OBJECTIVE: To systematically review radiomic feature reproducibility and model validation strategies in recent studies dealing with CT and MRI radiomics of bone and soft-tissue sarcomas, thus updating a previous version of this review which included studies published up to 2020. METHODS: A literature search was conducted on EMBASE and PubMed databases for papers published between January 2021 and March 2023. Data regarding radiomic feature reproducibility and model validation strategies were extracted and analyzed. RESULTS: Out of 201 identified papers, 55 were included. They dealt with radiomics of bone (n = 23) or soft-tissue (n = 32) tumors. Thirty-two (out of 54 employing manual or semiautomatic segmentation, 59%) studies included a feature reproducibility analysis. Reproducibility was assessed based on intra/interobserver segmentation variability in 30 (55%) and geometrical transformations of the region of interest in 2 (4%) studies. At least one machine learning validation technique was used for model development in 34 (62%) papers, and K-fold cross-validation was employed most frequently. A clinical validation of the model was reported in 38 (69%) papers. It was performed using a separate dataset from the primary institution (internal test) in 22 (40%), an independent dataset from another institution (external test) in 14 (25%) and both in 2 (4%) studies. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to papers published up to 2020, a clear improvement was noted with almost double publications reporting methodological aspects related to reproducibility and validation. Larger multicenter investigations including external clinical validation and the publication of databases in open-access repositories could further improve methodology and bring radiomics from a research area to the clinical stage.

       " Document(page_content='OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was automatically detecting and numbering teeth in digital bitewing radiographs obtained from patients, and evaluating the diagnostic efficiency of decayed teeth in real time, using deep learning algorithms. METHODS: The dataset consisted of 1170 anonymized digital bitewing radiographs randomly obtained from faculty archives. After image evaluation and labeling process, the dataset was split into training and test datasets. This study proposed an end-to-end pipeline architecture consisting of three stages for matching tooth numbers and caries lesions to enhance treatment outcomes and prevent potential issues. Initially, a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) utilized to determine the side of the bitewing images. Then, an improved CNN model YOLOv7 was proposed for tooth numbering and caries detection. In the final stage, our developed algorithm assessed which teeth have caries by comparing the numbered teeth with the detected caries, using the intersection over union value for the matching process. RESULTS: According to test results, the recall, precision, and F1-score values were 0.994, 0.987 and 0.99 for teeth detection, 0.974, 0.985 and 0.979 for teeth numbering, and 0.833, 0.866 and 0.822 for caries detection, respectively. For teeth numbering and caries detection matching performance; the accuracy, recall, specificity, precision and F1-Score values were 0.934, 0.834, 0.961, 0.851 and 0.842, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed model exhibited good achievement, highlighting the potential use of CNNs for tooth detection, numbering, and caries detection, concurrently.

However, research into synaptic devices exhibiting complex associative learning behaviors is still nascent. Here, an optoelectronic memristor based on Ag/TiO(2) Nanowires: ZnO Quantum dots/FTO was proposed and constructed to emulate the biological associative learning behaviors. Effective implementation of synaptic behaviors, including long and short-term plasticity, and learning-forgetting-relearning behaviors, were achieved in the device through the application of light and electrical stimuli. Leveraging the optoelectronic co-modulated characteristics, a simulation of neuromorphic computing was conducted, resulting in a handwriting digit recognition accuracy of 88.9%. Furthermore, a 3 x 7 memristor array was constructed, confirming its application in artificial visual memory. Most importantly, complex biological associative learning behaviors were emulated by mapping the light and electrical stimuli into conditioned and unconditioned stimuli, respectively. After training through associative pairs, reflexes could be triggered solely using light stimuli. Comprehensively, under specific optoelectronic signal applications, the four features of classical conditioning, namely acquisition, extinction, recovery, and generalization, were elegantly emulated.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the perspectives of patients and dermatologists after skin cancer screening by human, artificial and augmented intelligence. METHODS: A prospective comparative cohort study conducted at the University Hospital Basel included 205 patients (at high-risk of developing melanoma, with resected or advanced disease) and 8 dermatologists. Patients underwent skin cancer screening by a dermatologist with subsequent 2D and 3D total-body photography (TBP). Any suspicious and all melanocytic skin lesions >/=3 mm were imaged with digital dermoscopes and classified by corresponding convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Excisions were performed based on dermatologist's melanoma suspicion, study-defined elevated CNN risk-scores and/or melanoma suspicion by AuI. Subsequently, all patients and dermatologists were surveyed about their experience using questionnaires, including quantification of patient's safety sense following different examinations (subjective safety score (SSS): 0-10). RESULTS: Most patients believed AI could improve diagnostic performance (95.5%, n = 192/201). In total, 83.4% preferred AuI-based skin cancer screening compared to examination by AI or dermatologist alone (3D-TBP: 61.3%; 2D-TBP: 22.1%, n = 199). Regarding SSS, AuI induced a significantly higher feeling of safety than AI (mean-SSS (mSSS): 9.5 vs. 7.7, p < 0.0001) or dermatologist screening alone (mSSS: 9.5 vs. 9.1, p = 0.001). Most dermatologists expressed high trust in AI examination results (3D-TBP: 90.2%; 2D-TBP: 96.1%, n = 205). In 68.3% of the examinations, dermatologists felt that diagnostic accuracy improved through additional AI-assessment (n = 140/205). Especially beginners (<2 years' dermoscopic experience; 61.8%, n = 94/152) felt AI facilitated their clinical work compared to experts (>5 years' dermoscopic experience; 20.9%, n = 9/43). Contrarily, in divergent risk assessments, only 1.5% of dermatologists trusted a benign CNN-classification more than personal malignancy suspicion (n = 3/205).

METHODS: Two preclinical test sessions were performed with 11 participants (eight surgeons, two residents, and one medical student) executing three times six tasks, corresponding to a number of holographic data interactions and preoperative planning steps. At the end of each session, participants answered a questionnaire on user perception and usability. RESULTS: During the second trial, the participants were faster in all tasks than in the first one, while in the third one, the time of execution decreased only for two tasks (\"Patient selection\" and \"Scrolling through radiograph\") with respect to the second attempt, but without statistically significant difference (respectively [Formula: see text] = 0.14 and [Formula: see text] = 0.13, [Formula: see text]).

       " Document(page_content='State-of-the-art image object detection computational models require an intensive parameter fine-tuning stage (using deep convolution network, etc). with tens or hundreds of training examples. In contrast, human intelligence can robustly learn a new concept from just a few instances (i.e., few-shot detection). The distinctive perception mechanisms between these two families of systems enlighten us to revisit classical handcraft local descriptors (e.g., SIFT, HOG, etc.) as well as non-parametric visual models, which innately require no learning/training phase. Herein, we claim that the inferior performance of these local descriptors mainly results from a lack of global structure sense. To address this issue, we refine local descriptors with spatial contextual attention of neighbor affinities and then embed the local descriptors into discriminative subspace guided by Kernel-InfoNCE loss. Differing from conventional quantization of local descriptors in high-dimensional feature space or isometric dimension reduction, we actually seek a brain-inspired few-shot feature representation for the object manifold, which combines data-independent primitive representation and semantic context learning and thus helps with generalization. The obtained embeddings as pattern vectors/tensors permit us an accelerated but non-parametric visual similarity computation as the decision rule for final detection. Our approach to few-shot object detection is nearly learning-free, and experiments on remote sensing imageries (approximate 2-D affine space) confirm the efficacy of our model.', metadata={'PMID': '38410158', 'TI': 'In defense of local descriptor-based few-shot object detection.', 'FAU': 'Zhou, Shichao Li, Haoyan Wang, Zhuowei Zhang, Zekai', 'AU': 'Zhou S Li H Wang Z Zhang Z', 'DP': NaT, 'MH': 'None', 'OT': 'contextual features few-shot learning kernel method local descriptors visual similarity', 'PL': 'Switzerland', 'JT': 'Frontiers in neuroscience', 'PMC': 'PMC10894920', 'EDAT': NaT, 'MHDA': NaT, 'STAT': 'PubMed-not-MEDLINE'}),\n",

In reality, especially for large surgical resection specimens, dozens of slides can be available for each patient. Manually sorting and labelling whole-slide images (WSIs) is a very time-consuming process, hindering the direct application of AI on the collected tissue samples from large cohorts. In this study we addressed this issue by developing a deep-learning (DL)-based method for automatic curation of large pathology datasets with several slides per patient. METHODS: We collected multiple large multicentric datasets of colorectal cancer histopathological slides from the United Kingdom (FOXTROT, N = 21,384 slides; CR07, N = 7985 slides) and Germany (DACHS, N = 3606 slides). These datasets contained multiple types of tissue slides, including bowel resection specimens, endoscopic biopsies, lymph node resections, immunohistochemistry-stained slides, and tissue microarrays. We developed, trained, and tested a deep convolutional neural network model to predict the type of slide from the slide overview (thumbnail) image. The primary statistical endpoint was the macro-averaged area under the receiver operating curve (AUROCs) for detection of the type of slide. RESULTS: In the primary dataset (FOXTROT), with an AUROC of 0.995 [95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.994-0.996] the algorithm achieved a high classification performance and was able to accurately predict the type of slide from the thumbnail image alone.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the utility of ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence chatbot, in providing patient information for lumbar spinal fusion and lumbar laminectomy in comparison with the Google search engine. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence chatbot with seemingly unlimited functionality, may present an alternative to a Google web search for patients seeking information about medical questions. With widespread misinformation and suboptimal quality of online health information, it is imperative to assess ChatGPT as a resource for this purpose. METHODS: The first 10 frequently asked questions (FAQs) related to the search terms \"lumbar spinal fusion\" and \"lumbar laminectomy\" were extracted from Google and ChatGPT. Responses to shared questions were compared regarding length and readability, using the Flesch Reading Ease score and Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level. Numerical FAQs from Google were replicated in ChatGPT. RESULTS: Two of 10 (20%) questions for both lumbar spinal fusion and lumbar laminectomy were asked similarly between ChatGPT and Google. Compared with Google, ChatGPT\\'s responses were lengthier (340.0 vs. 159.3 words) and of lower readability (Flesch Reading Ease score: 34.0 vs. 58.2; Flesch-Kincaid grade level: 11.6 vs. 8.8).

       " Document(page_content=\"Cancer stem cell plasticity refers to the ability of tumour cells to dynamically switch between states-for example, from cancer stem cells to non-cancer stem cell states. Governed by regulatory processes, cells transition through a continuum, with this transition space often referred to as a cell state landscape. Plasticity in cancer cell states leads to divergent biological behaviours, with certain cell states, or state transitions, responsible for tumour progression and therapeutic response. The advent of single-cell assays means these features can now be measured for individual cancer cells and at scale. However, the high dimensionality of this data, complex relationships between genomic features, and a lack of precise knowledge of the genomic profiles defining cancer cell states have opened the door for artificial intelligence methods for depicting cancer cell state landscapes. The contribution of cell state plasticity to cancer phenotypes such as treatment resistance, metastasis, and dormancy has been masked by analysis of 'bulk' genomic data-constituted of the average signal from millions of cells. Single-cell technologies solve this problem by producing a high-dimensional cellular landscape of the tumour ecosystem, quantifying the genomic profiles of individual cells, and creating a more detailed model to investigate cancer plasticity (Genome Res 31:1719, 2021; Semin Cancer Biol 53: 48-58, 2018; Signal Transduct Target Ther 5:1-36, 2020).

We aimed to establish a relationship between ADHD diagnosis and serum levels of glucose, free thyroxine (FT4), and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in primary school aged boys. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, we enrolled 133 participants aged 6.5-12.5 years, 67 of whom met DSM-5 criteria for ADHD and 66 healthy age-matched boys. The ADHDT test (ADHDT) was used to assess ADHD symptoms and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children - Revised was used to exclude participants with cognitive deficits. The ADHD participants were tested using the Iowa Conners' Teacher Rating Scale. RESULTS: The ADHD participants had lower glucose levels, higher TSH values, and significantly lower FT4 values than the control group. The multiple logistic regression analysis showed that TSH is a parameter that is 2.7% more likely to occur in the ADHD group. We found a significant correlation between the TSH level and the symptoms of hyperactivity (r = 0.318, p = 0.009) and impulsivity (r = 0.275, p = 0.024) as well as between the glucose level and the symptoms of hyperactivity (r = 0.312, p = 0.010). CONCLUSIONS: Certain ADHD symptoms may correlate with certain hormonal patterns. Our results suggest that the likelihood of suffering from ADHD was lower when FT4 levels were elevated.

METHODS: A retrospective study of 170 eyes from 85 consecutive patients with confirmed STGD. Fundus autofluorescence images were extracted, and flecks were manually outlined. A deep learning model was trained, and a hold-out testing subset was used to compare with manually identified flecks and for graders to assess. Flecks were clustered using K-means clustering. RESULTS: Of the 85 subjects, 45 were female, and the median age was 37 years (IQR 25-59). A subset of subjects (n=41) had clearly identifiable fleck lesions, and an AI was successfully trained to identify these lesions (average Dice score of 0.53, n=18). The AI segmentation had smaller (0.018 compared with 0.034 mm(2), p<0.001) but more numerous flecks (75.5 per retina compared with 40.0, p<0.001), but the total size of flecks was not different. The AI model had higher sensitivity to detect flecks but resulted in more false positives. There were two clusters of flecks based on morphology: broadly, one cluster of small round flecks and another of large amorphous flecks. The per cent frequency of small round flecks negatively correlated with subject age (r=-0.31, p<0.005). CONCLUSIONS: AI-based detection of flecks shows greater sensitivity than human graders but with a higher false-positive rate.

Another query was issued to the LLMs to generate ICDs for these case scenarios. RESULTS: All four LLMs were able to provide answers to the queries related to all seven cases. In general, the responses were homogeneous with respect to most elements. LLMs performed suboptimally in identifying the suitability of the placebo arm, risk mitigation strategies and potential risks to study participants in certain case studies with a single prompt. However, multiple prompts led to better outputs in all of these domains. Each of the LLMs included all of the fundamental elements of the ICD for all case scenarios.

DESIGN: Longitudinal cohort study. PATIENTS: 123 children born <30 weeks were recruited at birth and assessed between 4 and 5 years' corrected age. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Development was assessed using the Movement Assessment Battery for Children, Second Edition (MABC-2), Little Developmental Coordination Disorder Questionnaire (L-DCDQ), Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (Fourth Edition; WPPSI-IV), and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). To measure PA, children wore an accelerometer and parents completed a diary for 7 days. Effects of PA on developmental outcomes, and associations between perinatal risk factors and PA, were estimated using linear regression. RESULTS: More accelerometer-measured PA was associated with better MABC-2 aiming and catching scores (average standard score increase per hour increase in PA: 0.54, 95% CI 0.11, 0.96; p=0.013), and lower WPPSI-IV processing speed index scores (average composite score decrease per hour increase in PA: -2.36, 95% CI -4.19 to -0.53; p=0.012). Higher accelerometer-measured PA was associated with better SDQ prosocial scores. Major brain injury in the neonatal period was associated with less moderate-vigorous and less unstructured PA at 4-5 years.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Standardized image sequences as well as a video with facial expressions were taken from 25 healthy volunteers. Four raters with dermatological expertise annotated eight features (wrinkles, redness, shine, pores, pigmentation spots, dark circles, skin sagging, and blemished skin) with a semi-quantitative and a linear scale in a cross-over design to evaluate differences between the image modalities and between the raters. RESULTS: In the videos, most parameters tended to be assessed with higher scores than in the images, and in some cases significantly. Furthermore, there were significant differences between the raters. CONCLUSION: The present study shows significant differences between the two evaluation methods using image or video analysis. In addition, the evaluation of the skin analysis depends on subjective criteria. Therefore, when training the AI, we recommend regular training of the annotating individuals and cross-validation of the annotation.\", metadata={'PMID': '38407411', 'TI': 'Differences in the annotation between facial images and videos for training an artificial intelligence for skin type determination.', 'FAU': 'Lehner, Gabriele Maria Gockeln, Laura Naber, Bettina Marie Thamm, Janis Raphael Schuh, Sandra Duttler, Gabriel Rottenkolber, Anna Hartmann, Dennis Kramer, Frank Welzel, Julia', 'AU': 'Lehner GM Gockeln L Naber BM Thamm JR Schuh S Duttler G Rottenkolber A Hartmann D Kramer F Welzel J', 'DP': NaT, 'MH': 'Humans *Artificial Intelligence Pilot Projects *Skin/diagnostic imaging Elasticity Face/diagnostic imaging', 'OT': 'annotation artificial intelligence cosmetics imaging skin analysis skin care', 'PL': 'England', 'JT': 'Skin research and technology : official journal of International Society for Bioengineering and the Skin (ISBS) [and] International Society for Digital Imaging of Skin (ISDIS) [and] International Society for Skin Imaging (ISSI)', 'PMC': 'PMC10895547', 'EDAT': NaT, 'MHDA': NaT, 'STAT': 'MEDLINE'}),\n",

Picking single protein particles from cryo-EM micrographs (images) is a crucial step in reconstructing protein structures from them. However, the widely used template-based particle picking process requires some manual particle picking and is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Though machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) can potentially automate particle picking, the current AI methods pick particles with low precision or low recall. The erroneously picked particles can severely reduce the quality of reconstructed protein structures, especially for the micrographs with low signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). RESULTS: To address these shortcomings, we devised CryoTransformer based on transformers, residual networks, and image processing techniques to accurately pick protein particles from cryo-EM micrographs. CryoTransformer was trained and tested on the largest labelled cryo-EM protein particle dataset-CryoPPP. It outperforms the current state-of-the-art machine learning methods of particle picking in terms of the resolution of 3D density maps reconstructed from the picked particles as well as F1-score, and is poised to facilitate the automation of the cryo-EM protein particle picking.

Previous literature indicates Gr is best modeled as a higher-order factor model with lower-level factors such as ideational fluency (IF), word fluency (WF), expressional fluency (EF), or figural fluency (FF). However, the dimensionality of Gr is not well studied. Furthermore, it remains unclear whether specific retrieval affordances such as differing retrieval time periods (e.g., short vs. long) can be psychometrically separated from more general retrieval affordances. Such a distinction would imply differential associations between specific retrieval, general retrieval, and other cognitive abilities, which, in turn, depict a vital part of explanatory models of individual differences in Gr. To test these assumptions, we conducted a multivariate study (N = 331) and evaluated competing latent variable measurement models for a variety of Gr tests. We then regressed the best measurement model onto working memory capacity, secondary memory, mental speed, and crystallized intelligence in order to evaluate the distinctiveness of Gr. Our results suggest that no specific retrieval affordances with regard to time periods can be distinguished. A higher-order model, with a second-order Gr factor above three first-order factors (IF, WF, EF, and FF) fitted the data best, extending previous literature by increasing construct coverage through the implementation of FF. All covariates show incremental predictive validity, beyond their communality. Summarizing, our results endorse a perspective on Gr as a strong and discriminant factor of cognitive abilities that is not affected by time constraints, and show that Gr is more than a linear combination of its parts.

METHODS: Transcriptomic and clinical data were sourced from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and the West China Hospital database. We focused on genes from the RNA immune-oncology panel. The elastic net approach was employed to pinpoint immune-related genes significantly impacting DFS. We developed the IRGPM for rectal cancer using the random forest technique. Based on the IRGPM, we calculated prognostic risk scores to categorize patients into high-risk and low-risk groups. Comparative analysis of immune characteristics between these groups was conducted. RESULTS: In this study, 407 LARC samples were analyzed. The elastic net identified a signature of 20 immune-related genes, forming the basis of the IRGPM. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed a lower 5-year DFS in the high-risk group compared to the low-risk group. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve affirmed the model's robust predictive capability. Validation of the model was performed in the GSE190826 cohort and our institution's cohort. Gene expression differences between high-risk and low-risk groups predominantly related to cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions. Notably, the low-risk group exhibited higher immune scores. Further analysis indicated a greater presence of activated B cells, activated CD8 T cells, central memory CD8 T cells, macrophages, T follicular helper cells, and type 2 helper cells in the low-risk group. Additionally, immune checkpoint analysis revealed elevated PDCD1 expression in the low-risk group. CONCLUSIONS: The IRGPM, developed through random forest and elastic net methodologies, demonstrates potential in distinguishing DFS among LARC patients receiving standard treatment.

This is the first multi-institutional study to describe and evaluate an artificial intelligence algorithm for autosegmentation of the pelvic nodal region by gender. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We retrospectively evaluated AASH pelvic nodal autosegmentation in both male and female patients treated at our network of institutions. The automated pelvic nodal contours generated by AASH were evaluated by 1 board-certified radiation oncologist. A 4-point scale was used for each nodal region contour: a score of 4 is clinically usable with minimal edits; a score of 3 requires minor edits (missing nodal contour region, cutting through vessels, or including bowel loops) in 3 or fewer computed tomography slices; a score of 2 requires major edits, as previously defined but in 4 or more computed tomography slices; and a score of 1 requires complete recontouring of the region. Pelvic nodal regions included the right and left side of the common iliac, external iliac, internal iliac, obturator, and midline presacral nodes. In addition, patients were graded based on their lowest nodal contour score. Statistical analysis was performed using Fisher exact tests and Yates-corrected chi(2) tests. RESULTS: Fifty-two female and 51 male patients were included in the study, representing a total of 468 and 447 pelvic nodal regions, respectively. Ninety-six percent and 99% of contours required minor edits at most (score of 3 or 4) for female and male patients, respectively (P = .004 using Fisher exact test; P = .007 using Yates correction).

However, only 18.2%-56.0% of astrocytomas demonstrate a positive T2FM. Methods must be considered for distinguishing astrocytomas from negative T2FM gliomas. In this study, positive T2FM gliomas were manually distinguished from nonenhancing gliomas, and then a support vector machine (SVM) classification model was used to distinguish astrocytomas from negative T2FM gliomas. METHODS: Nonenhancing gliomas (regardless of pathological type or grade) diagnosed between January 2022 and October 2022 (N = 300) and November 2022 and March 2023 (N = 196) will comprise the training and validation sets, respectively. Our method for distinguishing astrocytomas from nonenhancing gliomas was examined and validated using the training set and validation set. RESULTS: The specificity of T2FM for predicting astrocytomas was 100% in both the training and validation sets, while the sensitivity was 42.75% and 67.22%, respectively. Using a classification model of SVM based on radiomics features, among negative T2FM gliomas, the accuracy was above 85% when the prediction score was greater than 0.70 in identifying astrocytomas and above 95% when the prediction score was less than 0.30 in identifying nonastrocytomas. CONCLUSIONS: Manual screening of positive T2FM gliomas, followed by the SVM classification model to differentiate astrocytomas from negative T2FM gliomas, may be a more effective method for identifying astrocytomas in nonenhancing gliomas.', metadata={'PMID': '38405203', 'TI': 'Identifying IDH-mutant and 1p/19q noncodeleted astrocytomas from nonenhancing gliomas: Manual recognition followed by artificial intelligence recognition.', 'FAU': 'He, Lei Zhang, Hong Li, Tianshi Yang, Jianing Zhou, Yanpeng Wang, Jiaxiang Saidaer, Tuerhong Bai, Xiaoyan Liu, Xing Wang, Yinyan Wang, Lei', 'AU': 'He L Zhang H Li T Yang J Zhou Y Wang J Saidaer T Bai X Liu X Wang Y Wang L', 'DP': NaT, 'MH': 'None', 'OT': 'MRI T2-FLAIR mismatch astrocytoma machine learning nonenhancing glioma', 'PL': 'England', 'JT': 'Neuro-oncology advances', 'PMC': 'PMC10894653', 'EDAT': NaT, 'MHDA': NaT, 'STAT': 'PubMed-not-MEDLINE'}),\n",

Pulsed field ablation (PFA) is a novel ablation modality that carries a favourable safety profile, which could facilitate complex procedures. CASE SUMMARY: We present the case of a 60-year-old male undergoing catheter ablation for symptomatic persistent AF. The procedure was performed with the Farapulse PFA system in a stepwise manner, including PVI and linear lesions for the isolation of the posterior left atrial wall and the ablation of the mitral isthmus. The final step of the procedure included the ablation of areas exhibiting spatiotemporal electrogram dispersion, identified with the help of artificial intelligence-based software (VX1, Volta Medical) in both atria. Sinus rhythm was restored after the abolition of an electrogram dispersion zone in the right atrium. The procedure was carried out without any complications. DISCUSSION: Complex ablation procedures for persistent AF can be successfully performed with PFA. In the context of such extensive ablation strategies, PFA is an attractive energy source, given its non-thermal nature that is known to prevent damage to surrounding tissue and result in less chronic fibrosis. However, caution should be exercised to avoid excessive ablation when using the currently available multispline PFA catheter, as it may inadvertently target adjacent areas of healthy myocardium.', metadata={'PMID': '38405199', 'TI': 'Pulsed field ablation of spatiotemporal electrogram dispersion following pulmonary vein isolation and left atrial linear lesions for persistent atrial fibrillation: a case report.', 'FAU': 'Sousonis, Vasileios Voglimacci-Stephanopoli, Quentin Zeriouh, Sarah Boveda, Serge Albenque, Jean Paul', 'AU': 'Sousonis V Voglimacci-Stephanopoli Q Zeriouh S Boveda S Albenque JP', 'DP': NaT, 'MH': 'None', 'OT': 'Case report Catheter ablation Electrogram dispersion Electroporation Persistent atrial fibrillation Pulsed field ablation', 'PL': 'England', 'JT': 'European heart journal.

Analyzing the attributes of buildings using optimized machine learning models has been a highly effective approach for estimating the cooling load (C(L)) and heating load (H(L)) of the buildings. In this study, an artificial neural network (ANN) is used as the basic predictor that undergoes optimization using five metaheuristic algorithms, namely coati optimization algorithm (COA), gazelle optimization algorithm (GOA), incomprehensible but intelligible-in-time logics (IbIL), osprey optimization algorithm (OOA), and sooty tern optimization algorithm (STOA) to predict the C(L) and H(L) of a residential building. The models are trained and tested via an Energy Efficiency dataset (downloaded from UCI Repository). A score-based ranking system is built upon three accuracy evaluators including mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root mean square error (RMSE), and percentage-Pearson correlation coefficient (PPCC) to compare the prediction accuracy of the models. Referring to the results, all models demonstrated high accuracy (e.g., PPCCs >89%) for predicting both C(L) and H(L).

METHODS: 25 pharmacoresistant pediatric patients with pathologically confirmed focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), and 25 gender-matched healthy controls were included in this study. 3.0T MRI data and intelligence tests using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Forth Edition (WISC-IV) were generated for all subjects. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM)-diffeomorphic anatomical registration through exponentiated lie algebra (DARTEL) and surface-based morphometry (SBM) analyses were performed to analyze gray matter volume and cortical structure. Two-sample t-tests were used to compare the differences in gray matter volume (P＜0.05, FWE) and cortical thickness (P＜0.001, FWE) between the two groups. Also, the Spearman rank correlation analyses were employed to determine the relationship between structural alterations and neuropsychological results. RESULTS: The WISC-IV scores of the FCD group were significantly lower than those of the HC group in terms of full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ), verbal comprehension index (VCI), perceptual reasoning index (PRI), working memory index (WMI), and processing speed index (PSI) (all P＜0.01).

Commercially available artificial intelligence (AI) models, using deep learning algorithms (DLAs) for prostate gland segmentation, are rapidly increasing in numbers. Typically, their performance in a true clinical context is scarcely examined or published. We used a heterogenous clinical MRI dataset in this study aiming to contribute to validation of AI-models. APPROACH: We included 123 patients in this retrospective multicenter (7 hospitals), multiscanner (8 scanners, 2 vendors, 1.5T and 3T) study comparing prostate contour assessment by 2 commercially available Food and Drug Association (FDA)-cleared and CE-marked algorithms (DLA1 and DLA2) using an expert radiologist's manual contours as a reference standard (RSexp) in this clinical heterogeneous MRI dataset. No in-house training of the DLAs was performed before testing. Several methods for comparing segmentation overlap were used, the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) being the most important. RESULTS: The DSC mean and standard deviation for DLA1 versus the radiologist reference standard (RSexp) was 0.90 +/- 0.05 and for DLA2 versus RSexp it was 0.89 +/- 0.04. A paired t-test to compare the DSC for DLA1 and DLA2 showed no statistically significant difference (p = 0.8). CONCLUSIONS: Two commercially available DL algorithms (FDA-cleared and CE-marked) can perform accurate whole-gland prostate segmentation on a par with expert radiologist manual planimetry on a real-world clinical dataset.

A retrospective analysis was done of the laboratory tests conducted according to the type of anemia (microcytic, normocytic or macrocytic). Using an algorithmic system, the laboratory tests performed in real-life practice were compared with the recommendations suggested in the \"optimal laboratory test assessment\" and with seemingly \"unnecessary\" laboratory tests. RESULTS: In the analysis of the \"optimal laboratory test assessment\", of the 1179 patients with microcytic anemia, 269 (22.8%) had had one of the three tests recommended by the expert system, and only 33 (2.8%) had all three tests. For normocytic anemia, 1054 of 2313 patients (45.6%) had one of the eleven recommended tests, and none had all eleven. Of the 384 patients with macrocytic anemia, 196 (51%) had one of the four recommended tests, and none had all four. In the analysis of \"unnecessary laboratory tests\", one lab test was unnecessarily done in 727/3876 patients (18.8%), i.e. 339 of 1179 (28.8%) microcytic, 171 of 2313 (7.4%) normocytic, and 217 of 384 (56.5 %) macrocytic anemias. CONCLUSION: Laboratory investigations of anemia remain imperfect as more than half of the cases did not receive the expected tests.

This scoping review aimed at mapping the available technology instruments to improve access to imaging at primary health care; to identify the facilitators and barriers, and the knowledge gaps for widespread adaptation of technology solutions. METHODS: A search was conducted using broad inclusive terms non-specific to subtypes of medical imaging devices or informatics. Work published in the English language between 2005 and 2022, conducted primarily in India, and with full manuscripts were included. Two authors independently screened the abstracts against the inclusion criteria for full-text review and a senior author settled discrepancies. Data were extracted using DistillerSR software. FINDINGS: 43 original articles and 52 non-academic materials were finally reviewed. The data was from 10 Indian states with n = 9 from rural settings. The broad trends in original articles were: connectivity using teleradiology (n = 7), mobile digital imaging units (n = 9), artificial intelligence (n = 16); mobile devices and smartphone applications (n = 7); data security (n = 7) and web-based technology (n = 2); public-private partnership (n = 9); cost (n = 2); concordance (n = 19); evaluation (n = 4); implementation (n = 2). INTERPRETATION: Available evidence suggests that teleradiology when combined with AI and mobile digital imaging units can address radiologist shortages; strengthen programs aimed at population screening and emergency care. However, there is insufficient data on the scale of teleradiology networks within India; needs assessment; cost; facilitators, and barriers for implementation of technologies solutions in primary healthcare settings.

       " Document(page_content=\"PURPOSE: With the introduction of ChatGPT, artificial intelligence (AI)-based large language models (LLMs) are rapidly becoming popular within the scientific community. They use natural language processing to generate human-like responses to queries. However, the application of LLMs and comparison of the abilities among different LLMs with their human counterparts in ophthalmic care remain under-reported. RECENT FINDINGS: Hitherto, studies in eye care have demonstrated the utility of ChatGPT in generating patient information, clinical diagnosis and passing ophthalmology question-based examinations, among others. LLMs' performance (median accuracy, %) is influenced by factors such as the iteration, prompts utilised and the domain. Human expert (86%) demonstrated the highest proficiency in disease diagnosis, while ChatGPT-4 outperformed others in ophthalmology examinations (75.9%), symptom triaging (98%) and providing information and answering questions (84.6%). LLMs exhibited superior performance in general ophthalmology but reduced accuracy in ophthalmic subspecialties. Although AI-based LLMs like ChatGPT are deemed more efficient than their human counterparts, these AIs are constrained by their nonspecific and outdated training, no access to current knowledge, generation of plausible-sounding 'fake' responses or hallucinations, inability to process images, lack of critical literature analysis and ethical and copyright issues. A comprehensive evaluation of recently published studies is crucial to deepen understanding of LLMs and the potential of these AI-based LLMs. SUMMARY: Ophthalmic care professionals should undertake a conservative approach when using AI, as human judgement remains essential for clinical decision-making and monitoring the accuracy of information. This review identified the ophthalmic applications and potential usages which need further exploration. With the advancement of LLMs, setting standards for benchmarking and promoting best practices is crucial.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Random open-source angiograms of lower limbs were collected using a web-indexed search. An experienced researcher in vascular medicine labelled the angiograms according to the most applicable grade of femoropopliteal disease in the Global Limb Anatomic Staging System (GLASS). An AutoML model was trained using the Vertex AI (Google Cloud) platform to classify the angiograms according to the GLASS grade with a multi-label algorithm. Following deployment, we conducted a test using 25 random angiograms (five from each GLASS grade). Model tuning through incremental training by introducing new angiograms was executed to the limit of the allocated quota following the initial evaluation to determine its effect on the software's performance. RESULTS: We collected 323 angiograms to create the AutoML model. Among these, 80 angiograms were labelled as grade 0 of femoropopliteal disease in GLASS, 114 as grade 1, 34 as grade 2, 25 as grade 3 and 70 as grade 4. After 4.5 h of training, the AI model was deployed. The AI self-assessed average precision was 0.77 (0 is minimal and 1 is maximal). During the testing phase, the AI model successfully determined the GLASS grade in 100% of the cases. The agreement with the researcher was almost perfect with the number of observed agreements being 22 (88%), Kappa = 0.85 (95% CI 0.69-1.0). The best results were achieved in predicting GLASS grade 0 and grade 4 (initial precision: 0.76 and 0.84). However, the AI model exhibited poorer results in classifying GLASS grade 3 (initial precision: 0.2) compared to other grades. Disagreements between the AI and the researcher were associated with the low resolution of the test images. Incremental training expanded the initial dataset by 23% to a total of 417 images, which improved the model's average precision by 11% to 0.86. CONCLUSION: After a brief training period with a limited dataset, AutoML has demonstrated its potential in identifying and classifying the anatomical patterns of PAD, operating unhindered by the factors that can affect human analysts, such as fatigue or lack of experience. This technology bears the potential to revolutionize outcome prediction and standardize evidence-based revascularization strategies for patients with PAD, leveraging its adaptability and ability to continuously improve with additional data.

Accurate risk stratification allows for timely implantation of intracardiac defibrillators (ICD) and is currently performed using a multimodality prediction model. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate whether an explainable deep learning-based approach allows for risk prediction using only electrocardiogram (ECG) data. METHODS: A total of 679 PLN p.(Arg14del) carriers without MVA at baseline were identified. A deep learning-based variational auto-encoder, trained on 1.1 million ECGs, was used to convert the 12-lead baseline ECG into its FactorECG, a compressed version of the ECG which summarizes it into 32 explainable factors. Prediction models were developed using Cox regression. RESULTS: The deep learning-based ECG-only approach was able to predict MVA with a c-statistic of 0.79 [95% CI 0.76 - 0.83], comparable to the current prediction model (c-statistic 0.83 [95% CI 0.79 - 0.88], p = 0.064) and outperforming a model based on conventional ECG parameters (low voltage ECG and negative T waves; c-statistic 0.65 [95% CI 0.58 - 0.73], p < 0.001). Clinical simulations showed that a two-step approach, with ECG-only screening followed by a full work-up, resulted in 60% less additional diagnostics, while outperforming the use of the multimodal prediction model in all patients. A visualization tool was created to provide interactive visualizations (https://pln.ecgx.ai).

(2) What are the challenges and limitations of combined remediation techniques for co-contaminated soils compared to single-treatment methods in terms of efficiency, stability, and specificity? (3) How do various factors influence the effectiveness of biological, chemical, and physical remediation methods, both individually and combined, in co-contaminated soils, and what role do specific agents play in the degradation, immobilization, or removal of heavy metals and PAHs under diverse environmental conditions? (4) Do AI-powered search tools offer a superior alternative to conventional search methodologies for executing an exhaustive systematic review? Utilizing big-data analytics and AI tools such as Litmaps.co, ResearchRabbit, and MAXQDA, this study conducts a thorough analysis of remediation techniques for soils co-contaminated with heavy metals and PAHs. It emphasizes the significance of cation-pi interactions and soil composition in dictating the solubility and behavior of these pollutants. The study pays particular attention to the interplay between heavy metals and PAH solubility, as well as the impact of soil properties like clay type and organic matter on heavy metal adsorption, which results in nonlinear sorption patterns. The research identifies a growing trend towards employing combined remediation techniques, especially biological strategies like biostimulation-bioaugmentation, noting their effectiveness in laboratory settings, albeit with potentially higher costs in field applications. Plants such as Medicago sativa L. and Solanum nigrum L. are highlighted for their effectiveness in phytoremediation, working synergistically with beneficial microbes to decompose contaminants. Furthermore, the study illustrates that the incorporation of biochar and surfactants, along with chelating agents like EDTA, can significantly enhance treatment efficiency. However, the research acknowledges that varying environmental conditions necessitate site-specific adaptations in remediation strategies. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) findings indicate that while high-energy methods like Steam Enhanced Extraction and Thermal Resistivity - ERH are effective, they also entail substantial environmental and financial costs. Conversely, Natural Attenuation, despite being a low-impact and cost-effective option, may require prolonged monitoring. The study advocates for an integrative approach to soil remediation, one that harmoniously balances environmental sustainability, cost-effectiveness, and the specific requirements of contaminated sites. It underscores the necessity of a holistic strategy that combines various remediation methods, tailored to meet both regulatory compliance and the long-term sustainability of decontamination efforts.', metadata={'PMID': '38402679', 'TI': 'AI-assisted systematic review on remediation of contaminated soils with PAHs and heavy metals.', 'FAU': 'Ashkanani, Zainab Mohtar, Rabi Al-Enezi, Salah Smith, Patricia K Calabrese, Salvatore Ma, Xingmao Abdullah, Meshal', 'AU': 'Ashkanani Z Mohtar R Al-Enezi S Smith PK Calabrese S Ma X Abdullah M', 'DP': Timestamp('2024-02-17 00:00:00'), 'MH': 'None', 'OT': 'Artificial intelligence tools Big-data analytics Heavy metals Petroleum hydrocarbons Remediation approaches Soil contaminations', 'PL': 'Netherlands', 'JT': 'Journal of hazardous materials', 'PMC': 'None', 'EDAT': NaT, 'MHDA': NaT, 'STAT': 'Publisher'}),\n",

None more so than non-GMO (genetically modified organisms) labels. This manuscript provides a timeline of the evolution of GMO labels beginning with the early history of the anti-GMO movement to the current National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard in the United States. Using media and market intelligence data collected through Buzzsumo and Mintel, public discourse of GMOs is analyzed in relation to sociopolitical events and the number of new food products with anti-GMO labels, respectively. Policy document and publication data is collected with Overton to illustrate the policy landscape for the GMO topic and how it has changed over time. Analysis of the collective data illustrates that while social media and policy engagement around the topic of GMOs has diminished over time, the number of new products with a GMO-free designation continues to grow. While discourse peaked at one point, and has since declined, our results suggest that the legacy of an anti-GMO narrative remains firmly embedded in the social psyche, evidenced by the continuing rise of products with GMO-free designation.

The objective of this study is to extract p16-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) features in a form that can be interpreted by pathologists using AI model. We constructed a model for predicting p16 expression using a dataset of whole-slide images from 114 OPSCC biopsy cases. We used the clustering-constrained attention-based multiple-instance learning (CLAM) model, a weakly supervised learning approach. To improve performance, we incorporated tumor annotation into the model (Annot-CLAM) and achieved the mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.905. Utilizing the image patches on which the model focused, we examined the features of model interest via histopathologic morphological analysis and cycle-consistent adversarial network (CycleGAN) image translation. The histopathologic morphological analysis evaluated the histopathological characteristics of image patches, revealing significant differences in the numbers of nuclei, the perimeters of the nuclei, and the intercellular bridges between p16-negative and p16-positive image patches. By using the CycleGAN-converted images, we confirmed that the sizes and densities of nuclei are significantly converted.

       " Document(page_content='Accurate prediction of sea level height is critically important for the government in assessing sea level risk in coastal areas. However, due to the nonlinear, time-varying and highly uncertain characteristics of sea level change data, sea level prediction is challenging. To improve the accuracy of sea level prediction, this paper uses a new swarm intelligence algorithm named the sparrow search algorithm (SSA), which can imitate the foraging behavior and antipredation behavior of sparrows, to determine optimal solutions. To avoid the algorithm falling into a local optimal situation, this paper integrates the sine-cosine algorithm and the Cauchy variation strategy into the SSA to obtain an algorithm named the SCSSA. The SCSSA is used to optimize the parameter values of the CNN-BiLSTM (convolutional neural network combined with bidirectional long short-term memory neural network) model; finally, a combined neural network model (named SCSSA-CNN-BiLSTM) is proposed. In this paper, the time series data of seven tidal stations located in coastal China are used for experimental analysis. First, the SCSSA-CNN-BiLSTM model is compared with the CNN-BiLSTM model to predict the time series data of SHANWEI Station. With respect to the training and test sets of data, the SCSSA-CNN-BiLSTM model outperforms the other models on all the evaluation metrics. In addition, the remaining six tide station datasets and five neural network models, including the SCSSA-CNN-BiLSTM model, are used to further study the performance of the proposed prediction model. Four evaluation indices including the root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and coefficient of determination (R(2)) are adopted. For six stations, the RMSE, MAE, MAPE and R(2) of SCSSA-CNN-BiLSTM model are ranged from 20.9217 ~ 27.8427 mm, 9.4770 ~ 17.8603 mm, 0.1322% ~ 0.2482% and 0.9119 ~ 0.9759, respectively. The experimental analysis results show that the SCSSA-CNN-BiLSTM model makes effective predictions at all stations, and the prediction performance is better than that of the other models. Even though the combination of SCSSA algorithm may increase the complexity of the model, indeed the proposed model is a new prediction method with good accuracy and robustness for predicting sea level change.', metadata={'PMID': '38402324', 'TI': 'An improved sparrow search algorithm and CNN-BiLSTM neural network for predicting sea level height.', 'FAU': 'Li, Xiao Zhou, Shijian Wang, Fengwei Fu, Laiying', 'AU': 'Li X Zhou S Wang F Fu L', 'DP': Timestamp('2024-02-24 00:00:00'), 'MH': 'None', 'OT': 'None', 'PL': 'England', 'JT': 'Scientific reports', 'PMC': 'PMC10894254', 'EDAT': NaT, 'MHDA': NaT, 'STAT': 'PubMed-not-MEDLINE'}),\n",

This study evaluates the effectiveness of a novel course implemented in an academic radiology department training program over a 5-year period designed to educate future radiologists on the fundamentals of medical innovation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A pre- and post-course survey and examination were administered to residents who participated in the innovation course (MESH Core) from 2018 to 2022. Respondents were first evaluated on their subjective comfort level, understanding, and beliefs on innovation-related topics using a 5-point Likert-scale survey. Respondents were also administered a 21-question multiple-choice exam to test their objective knowledge of innovation-related topics. RESULTS: Thirty-eight residents participated in the survey (response rate 95%). Resident understanding, comfort and belief regarding innovation-related topics improved significantly (P < .0001) on all nine Likert-scale questions after the course. After the course, a significant majority of residents either agreed or strongly agreed that technological innovation should be a core competency for the residency curriculum, and that a workshop to prototype their ideas would be beneficial.

       " Document(page_content='PURPOSE: To evaluate the diagnostic performance and generalizability of the winning DL algorithm of the RSNA 2020 PE detection challenge to a local population using CTPA data from two hospitals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive CTPA images from patients referred for suspected PE were retrospectively analysed. The winning RSNA 2020 DL algorithm was retrained on the RSNA-STR Pulmonary Embolism CT (RSPECT) dataset. The algorithm was tested in hospital A on multidetector CT (MDCT) images of 238 patients and in hospital B on spectral detector CT (SDCT) and virtual monochromatic images (VMI) of 114 patients. The output of the DL algorithm was compared with a reference standard, which included a consensus reading by at least two experienced cardiothoracic radiologists for both hospitals. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) were calculated. Sensitivity and specificity were determined using the maximum Youden index. RESULTS: According to the reference standard, PE was present in 73 patients (30.7%) in hospital A and 33 patients (29.0%) in hospital B.

       " Document(page_content='BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have demonstrated the ability to pass standardized exams. These models are not trained for a specific task, but instead trained to predict sequences of text from large corpora of documents sourced from the internet. It has been shown that even models trained on this general task can pass exams in a variety of domain-specific fields, including the United States Medical Licensing Examination. We asked if large language models would perform as well on a much narrower subdomain tests designed for medical specialists. Furthermore, we wanted to better understand how progressive generations of GPT (generative pre-trained transformer) models may be evolving in the completeness and sophistication of their responses even while generational training remains general. In this study, we evaluated the performance of two versions of GPT (GPT 3 and 4) on their ability to pass the certification exam given to physicians to work as osteoporosis specialists and become a certified clinical densitometrists. The CCD exam has a possible score range of 150 to 400. To pass, you need a score of 300. METHODS: A 100-question multiple-choice practice exam was obtained from a 3rd party exam preparation website that mimics the accredited certification tests given by the ISCD (International Society for Clinical Densitometry). The exam was administered to two versions of GPT, the free version (GPT Playground) and ChatGPT+, which are based on GPT-3 and GPT-4, respectively (OpenAI, San Francisco, CA). The systems were prompted with the exam questions verbatim. If the response was purely textual and did not specify which of the multiple-choice answers to select, the authors matched the text to the closest answer. Each exam was graded and an estimated ISCD score was provided from the exam website. In addition, each response was evaluated by a rheumatologist CCD and ranked for accuracy using a 5-level scale. The two GPT versions were compared in terms of response accuracy and length. RESULTS: The average response length was 11.6 +/-19 words for GPT-3 and 50.0+/-43.6 words for GPT-4. GPT-3 answered 62 questions correctly resulting in a failing ISCD score of 289. However, GPT-4 answered 82 questions correctly with a passing score of 342. GPT-3 scored highest on the \"Overview of Low Bone Mass and Osteoporosis\" category (72\\u202f% correct) while GPT-4 scored well above 80\\u202f% accuracy on all categories except \"Imaging Technology in Bone Health\" (65\\u202f% correct). Regarding subjective accuracy, GPT-3 answered 23 questions with nonsensical or totally wrong responses while GPT-4 had no responses in that category. CONCLUSION: If this had been an actual certification exam, GPT-4 would now have a CCD suffix to its name even after being trained using general internet knowledge. Clearly, more goes into physician training than can be captured in this exam. However, GPT algorithms may prove to be valuable physician aids in the diagnoses and monitoring of osteoporosis and other diseases.', metadata={'PMID': '38401238', 'TI': 'Performance of Progressive Generations of GPT on an Exam Designed for Certifying Physicians as Certified Clinical Densitometrists.', 'FAU': 'Valdez, Dustin Bunnell, Arianna Lim, Sian Y Sadowski, Peter Shepherd, John A', 'AU': 'Valdez D Bunnell A Lim SY Sadowski P Shepherd JA', 'DP': Timestamp('2024-02-17 00:00:00'), 'MH': 'None', 'OT': 'CCD GPT LLM clinical densitometry', 'PL': 'United States', 'JT': 'Journal of clinical densitometry : the official journal of the International Society for Clinical Densitometry', 'PMC': 'None', 'EDAT': NaT, 'MHDA': NaT, 'STAT': 'Publisher'}),\n",

Often, abstract reasoning tasks like Raven's progressive matrices are used to assess Gf. Prior work has shown an age-related decline in fluid intelligence capabilities, and although many studies have sought to identify the underlying mechanisms, our understanding of the critical brain regions and dynamics remains largely incomplete. In this study, we utilized magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate 78 individuals, ages 20-65 years, as they completed an abstract reasoning task. MEG data was co-registered with structural MRI data, transformed into the time-frequency domain, and the resulting neural oscillations were imaged using a beamformer. We found worsening behavioral performance with age, including prolonged reaction times and reduced accuracy. MEG analyses indicated robust oscillations in the theta, alpha/beta, and gamma range during the task. Whole brain correlation analyses with age revealed relationships in the theta and alpha/beta frequency bands, such that theta oscillations became stronger with increasing age in a right prefrontal region and alpha/beta oscillations became stronger with increasing age in parietal and right motor cortices. Follow-up connectivity analyses revealed increasing parieto-frontal connectivity with increasing age in the alpha/beta frequency range. Importantly, our findings are consistent with the parieto-frontal integration theory of intelligence (P-FIT).

However, robotic surgery reduces surgical stress and inflammation by minimizing tissue trauma. This contributes to faster recovery but may limit immune function. Robotic procedures also limit ischemia-reperfusion injury and oxidative damage compared to open surgery. They also help preserve native antioxidant defenses and coagulation. In a clinical setting, robotic procedures reduce blood loss, pain, complications, and length of stay compared to traditional procedures. However, risks remain, including device failure, the need for conversion to open surgery and increased costs.

There are many overwhelming reasons for this, but the high cost, implementation complexity, and malfunctioning sensors cause inappropriate decisions. The PRIMA INTEL-IRRIS project aims to make digital and innovative agricultural technologies more appealing and available to these communities by advancing the intelligent irrigation \"in-the-box\" concept.

To prevent agro-field data leakage, this paper presents an innovative, smart, and sustainable low-cost irrigation system that employs artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to analyze anomalies and problems in water usage. The sensor anomaly can be detected using an autoencoder (AE) and a generative adversarial network (GAN). We will feed the autoencoders\\' anomaly detection models with time series records from the datasets and replace detected anomalies with the reconstructed outputs. When integrated with an IoT platform, this methodology is a tool for easing the labeling of sensor anomalies and can help create supervised datasets for future research. In addition, anomalies can be corrected by prediction models based on deep learning approaches, applying CNN/BiLSTM architecture.

The UAV can conduct intelligent inspection on each work area of the workshop to solve or provide timely feedback on problems in the work area. The sparrow search algorithm (SSA), as a novel swarm intelligence optimization algorithm, has been proven to have good optimization performance. However, the reduction in the SSA's search capability in the middle or late stage of iterations reduces population diversity, leading to shortcomings of the algorithm, including low convergence speed, low solution accuracy and an increased risk of falling into local optima. To overcome these difficulties, an improved sparrow search algorithm (namely the chaotic mapping-firefly sparrow search algorithm (CFSSA)) is proposed by integrating chaotic cube mapping initialization, firefly algorithm disturbance search and tent chaos mapping perturbation search. First, chaotic cube mapping was used to initialize the population to improve the distribution quality and diversity of the population. Then, after the sparrow search, the firefly algorithm disturbance and tent chaos mapping perturbation were employed to update the positions of all individuals in the population to enable a full search of the algorithm in the solution space. This technique can effectively avoid falling into local optima and improve the convergence speed and solution accuracy. The simulation results showed that, compared with the traditional intelligent bionic algorithms, the optimized algorithm provided a greatly improved convergence capability. The feasibility of the proposed algorithm was validated with a final simulation test. Compared with other SSA optimization algorithms, the results show that the CFSSA has the best efficiency.

Automated scoring systems with AI enhance screening quality, but their effectiveness depends on their integration into the broader screening ecosystem. LLMs emerge as an important tool to fill gaps in the screening process, from personalized invitations to reporting results, facilitating a seamless and efficient system. However, it is essential to address concerns surrounding technical accuracy and governance before full-scale integration into the healthcare system. In conclusion, this review highlights the challenges in the current screening pathway and the potential for AI, particularly LLM, to revolutionize DR screening in Japan.

This review aims to provide an overview of the current state of research and highlight the potential for this alliance to advance pharmaceutical innovation by accelerating the development and deployment of novel therapeutics. We previously performed a scoping review of three databases (Embase, MEDLINE, and CENTRAL), identifying 87 studies published between 2018 and 2022 relevant to medical imaging (e.g., CT, PET, MRI), immunotherapy, artificial intelligence, and radiomics. Herein, we reexamine the previously identified studies, performing a subgroup analysis on articles specifically utilizing AI and PET imaging for drug discovery purposes in immunotherapy-treated oncology patients. Of the 87 original studies identified, 15 met our updated search criteria. In these studies, radiomics features were primarily extracted from PET/CT images in combination (n = 9, 60.0%) rather than PET imaging alone (n = 6, 40.0%), and patient cohorts were mostly recruited retrospectively and from single institutions (n = 10, 66.7%). AI models were used primarily for prognostication (n = 6, 40.0%) or for assisting in tumor phenotyping (n = 4, 26.7%). About half of the studies stress-tested their models using validation sets (n = 4, 26.7%) or both validation sets and test sets (n = 4, 26.7%), while the remaining six studies (40.0%) either performed no validation at all or used less stringent methods such as cross-validation on the training set. Overall, the integration of AI and PET imaging represents a paradigm shift in drug discovery, offering new avenues for more efficient development of therapeutics. By leveraging AI algorithms and PET imaging analysis, researchers could gain deeper insights into disease mechanisms, identify new drug targets, or optimize treatment regimens.

We discuss how AI and radiomics have notably improved the accuracy of diagnosis and staging in bladder cancer, especially through advanced imaging techniques like multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) and CT scans. These tools are pivotal in assessing muscle invasiveness and pathological grades, critical elements in formulating treatment plans. In the realm of kidney cancer, AI and radiomics aid in distinguishing between renal cell carcinoma (RCC) subtypes and grades. The integration of radiogenomics offers a comprehensive view of disease biology, leading to tailored therapeutic approaches. Prostate cancer diagnosis and management have also seen substantial benefits from these technologies. AI-enhanced MRI has significantly improved tumor detection and localization, thereby aiding in more effective treatment planning. The review also addresses the challenges in integrating AI and radiomics into clinical practice, such as the need for standardization, ensuring data quality, and overcoming the \"black box\" nature of AI. We emphasize the importance of multicentric collaborations and extensive studies to enhance the applicability and generalizability of these technologies in diverse clinical settings.

The latter are attractive because they can provide high-resolution data on the distribution of proteins in tissue. However, many immunohistochemical results are complex because the protein of interest occurs in multiple locations (in different cells and also extracellularly). We have recently established an artificial intelligence framework, PathoFusion which utilises a bifocal convolutional neural network (BCNN) model for detecting and counting arbitrarily definable morphological structures. We have now complemented this model by adding an attention-based graph neural network (abGCN) for the advanced analysis and automated interpretation of such data. Classical convolutional neural network (CNN) models suffer from limitations when handling global information. In contrast, our abGCN is capable of creating a graph representation of cellular detail from entire WSIs. This abGCN method combines attention learning with visualisation techniques that pinpoint the location of informative cells and highlight cell-cell interactions. We have analysed cellular labelling for CD276, a protein of great interest in cancer immunology and a potential marker of malignant glioma cells/putative glioma stem cells (GSCs). We are especially interested in the relationship between CD276 expression and prognosis. The graphs permit predicting individual patient survival on the basis of GSC community features.

From open-heart surgical ablation to the currently widely used percutaneous approach, catheter ablation is a safe and effective procedure able to target the responsible re-entry myocardial circuit from both the endocardium and the epicardium.

Luminescence assays assessed the ability of these compounds to restore JAK-2 activity diminished by SOCS3. Jurkat T and BEAS-2B cells were utilized to investigate changes in SOCS3 and STAT3 expression, along with STAT3 phosphorylation in response to the identified compounds.

Screening identified 20 hit compounds with robust binding affinities. As the concentration of SOCS3 increased, a corresponding decrease in JAK2 activity was observed. Compounds 5 and 8 exhibited significant efficacy in restoring JAK2 activity without toxicity. Treatment with these compounds resulted in reduced SOCS3 expression and the reinstatement of STAT3 phosphorylation in Jurkat T and BEAS-2B cells. In the OVA-induced allergic rhinitis mouse model, compounds 5 and 8 effectively alleviated nasal symptoms and demonstrated lower levels of immune markers compared to the allergy group.

Conventional risk scoring systems were also summarized, with their pros and cons being included in the results section of this study in order to provide a useful contrast with AI-based models. There are certain interesting and innovative ML approaches towards RHF prediction among the studies reviewed as well as more straightforward approaches that identified certain important predictive clinical parameters. Despite their accomplishments, the resulting AUC scores were far from ideal for these methods to be considered fully sufficient. The reasons for this include the low number of studies, standardized data availability, and lack of prospective studies. Another topic briefly discussed in this study is that relating to the ethical and legal considerations of using AI-based systems in healthcare.

These radiopacities are incidentally detected on dental panoramic radiographs taken for other reasons. In this study, we investigated the performance of a deep learning model in detecting IO using a small dataset of dental panoramic radiographs with varying contrasts and features. Two radiologists collected 175 IO-diagnosed dental panoramic radiographs from the dental school database. The dataset size is limited due to the rarity of IO, with its incidence in the Turkish population reported as 2.7% in studies. To overcome this limitation, data augmentation was performed by horizontally flipping the images, resulting in an augmented dataset of 350 panoramic radiographs. The images were annotated by two radiologists and divided into approximately 70% for training (245 radiographs), 15% for validation (53 radiographs), and 15% for testing (52 radiographs). The study employing the YOLOv5 deep learning model evaluated the results using precision, recall, F1-score, mAP (mean Average Precision), and average inference time score metrics.

       " Document(page_content='OBJECTIVES: To compare the location of AI markings on screening mammograms with cancer location on diagnostic mammograms, and to classify interval cancers with high AI score as false negative, minimal sign, or true negative. METHODS: In a retrospective study from 2022, we compared the performance of an AI system with independent double reading according to cancer detection. We found 93% (880/949) of the screen-detected cancers, and 40% (122/305) of the interval cancers to have the highest AI risk score (AI score of 10). In this study, four breast radiologists reviewed mammograms from 126 randomly selected screen-detected cancers and all 120 interval cancers with an AI score of 10. The location of the AI marking was stated as correct/not correct in craniocaudal and mediolateral oblique view. Interval cancers with an AI score of 10 were classified as false negative, minimal sign significant/non-specific, or true negative. RESULTS: All screen-detected cancers and 78% (93/120) of the interval cancers with an AI score of 10 were correctly located by the AI system. The AI markings matched in both views for 79% (100/126) of the screen-detected cancers and 22% (26/120) of the interval cancers. For interval cancers with an AI score of 10, 11% (13/120) were correctly located and classified as false negative, 10% (12/120) as minimal sign significant, 26% (31/120) as minimal sign non-specific, and 31% (37/120) as true negative. CONCLUSION: AI markings corresponded to cancer location for all screen-detected cancers and 78% of the interval cancers with high AI score, indicating a potential for reducing the number of interval cancers. However, it is uncertain whether interval cancers with subtle findings in only one view are actionable for recall in a true screening setting. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: In this study, AI markings corresponded to the location of the cancer in a high percentage of cases, indicating that the AI system accurately identifies the cancer location in mammograms with a high AI score. KEY POINTS: * All screen-detected and 78% of the interval cancers with high AI risk score (AI score of 10) had AI markings in one or two views corresponding to the location of the cancer on diagnostic images. * Among all 120 interval cancers with an AI score of 10, 21% (25/120) were classified as a false negative or minimal sign significant and had AI markings matching the cancer location, suggesting they may be visible on prior screening. * Most of the correctly located interval cancers matched only in one view, and the majority were classified as either true negative or minimal sign non-specific, indicating low potential for being detected earlier in a real screening setting.', metadata={'PMID': '38396248', 'TI': 'How do AI markings on screening mammograms correspond to cancer location?

One promising area for the use of AI is in the field of acute kidney injury (AKI). The use of AI is primarily focused on the prediction of AKI, but further approaches are also being used to classify existing AKI into different phenotypes. Different AI models are used for prediction. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values (AUROC) achieved with these models vary and are influenced by several factors, such as the prediction time and the definition of AKI. Most models have an AUROC between 0.650 and 0.900, with lower values for predictions further into the future and when applying Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) instead of KDIGO criteria. Classification into phenotypes already makes it possible to categorize patients into groups with different risks of mortality or requirement of renal replacement therapy (RRT), but the etiologies or therapeutic consequences derived from this are still lacking. However, all the models suffer from AI-specific shortcomings. The use of large databases does not make it possible to promptly include recent changes in therapy and the implementation of new biomarkers in a relevant proportion. For this reason, serum creatinine and urinary output, with their known limitations, dominate current AI models for prediction impairing the performance of the current models. On the other hand, the increasingly complex models no longer allow physicians to understand the basis on which the warning of a threatening AKI is calculated and subsequent initiation of therapy should take place. The successful use of AIs in routine clinical practice will be highly determined by the trust of the physicians in the systems and overcoming the aforementioned weaknesses.

Molecular fingerprints represent a widely employed class of descriptors; however, their generation process is time-consuming for large databases and is susceptible to bias. Therefore, descriptors able to accurately detect predefined structural fragments and devoid of lengthy generation procedures would be highly desirable. To meet additional needs, such descriptors should also be interpretable by medicinal chemists, and suitable for indexing databases with trillions of compounds.

DK represent an exhaustive collection of curated SMARTS strings, defining chemical features at different levels of complexity, from specific functional groups and structural patterns to simpler pharmacophoric points, corresponding to a network of hierarchically interconnected substructures. Because of their extended and hierarchical structure, DK can be used, with good performance, in different kinds of applications. In particular, we demonstrate how they are very well suited for effective mapping of chemical space, as well as substructure search and virtual screening. Notably, the incorporation of DK yields highly performing machine learning models for the prediction of both compounds' activity and metabolic reaction occurrence.

This classification largely depends on the assessment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), estrogen receptor (ER), and progesterone receptor (PR) status. However, variability in interpretation among pathologists pose challenges to the accuracy of this classification. This study evaluates the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in enhancing the consistency of these evaluations. METHODS: AI-powered HER2 and ER/PR analyzers, consisting of cell and tissue models, were developed using 1,259 HER2, 744 ER, and 466 PR-stained immunohistochemistry (IHC) whole-slide images of breast cancer. External validation cohort comprising HER2, ER, and PR IHCs of 201 breast cancer cases were analyzed with these AI-powered analyzers. Three board-certified pathologists independently assessed these cases without AI annotation. Then, cases with differing interpretations between pathologists and the AI analyzer were revisited with AI assistance, focusing on evaluating the influence of AI assistance on the concordance among pathologists during the revised evaluation compared to the initial assessment. RESULTS: Reevaluation was required in 61 (30.3%), 42 (20.9%), and 80 (39.8%) of HER2, in 15 (7.5%), 17 (8.5%), and 11 (5.5%) of ER, and in 26 (12.9%), 24 (11.9%), and 28 (13.9%) of PR evaluations by the pathologists, respectively. Compared to initial interpretations, the assistance of AI led to a notable increase in the agreement among three pathologists on the status of HER2 (from 49.3 to 74.1%, p < 0.001), ER (from 93.0 to 96.5%, p = 0.096), and PR (from 84.6 to 91.5%, p = 0.006). This improvement was especially evident in cases of HER2 2+ and 1+, where the concordance significantly increased from 46.2 to 68.4% and from 26.5 to 70.7%, respectively.

We propose a method for quantitative haematoxylin and eosin stain assessment to facilitate quality assurance of histopathology staining, enabling truly quantitative quality control and improved standardisation. METHODS: The stain quantification method comprises conventional microscope slides with a stain-responsive biopolymer film affixed to one side, called stain assessment slides. The stain assessment slides were characterised with haematoxylin and eosin, and implemented in one clinical laboratory to quantify variation levels. RESULTS: Stain assessment slide stain uptake increased linearly with duration of haematoxylin and eosin staining (r = 0.99), and demonstrated linearly comparable staining to samples of human liver tissue (r values 0.98-0.99). Laboratory implementation of this technique quantified intra- and inter-instrument variation of staining instruments at one point in time and across a five-day period.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective cross-sectional study was conducted at Shenzhen University General Hospital between September 2022 and June 2023, and focused on mid-trimester fetuses. All ultrasound images of the six standard planes, that enabled the evaluation of nine biometric measurements, were included to compare the performance of CUPID through subjective and objective assessments. RESULTS: There were 642 fetuses with a mean (+/-SD) age of 22 +/- 2.82 weeks at enrollment.

OBJECTIVE: Using machine learning, we localized and characterized esophageal mast cells to decipher their potential role in disease pathology. METHODS: Esophageal biopsy samples (EoE, control) were stained for mast cells by anti-tryptase and imaged using immunofluorescence; high-resolution whole tissue images were digitally assembled. Machine learning software was trained to identify, enumerate, and characterize mast cells, designated Mast Cell-Artificial Intelligence (MC-AI). RESULTS: MC-AI enumerated cell counts with high accuracy. During active EoE, epithelial mast cells increased and lamina propria (LP) mast cells decreased. In controls and EoE remission patients, papillae had the highest mast cell density and negatively correlated with epithelial mast cell density. Mast cell density in the epithelium and papillae correlated with the degree of epithelial eosinophilic inflammation, basal zone hyperplasia, and LP fibrosis. MC-AI detected greater mast cell degranulation in the epithelium, papillae, and LP in EoE patients compared with control individuals. Mast cells were localized further from the basement membrane in active EoE than EoE remission and control individuals but were closer than eosinophils to the basement membrane in active EoE. CONCLUSION: Using MC-AI, we identified a distinct population of homeostatic esophageal papillae mast cells; during active EoE, this population decreases, undergoes degranulation, negatively correlates with epithelial mast cell levels, and significantly correlates with distinct histologic features.

METHODS: PIMs from AUA, CUA, and EAU related to nephrolithiasis were obtained and categorized. The most frequent patient questions related to kidney stones were identified from an internet query and input into GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. PIMs and ChatGPT outputs were assessed for accuracy and readability using previously published indexes. We also assessed changes in ChatGPT outputs when a reading level was specified (grade 6). RESULTS: Readability scores were better for PIMs from the CUA (Grade level 10 - 12), AUA (8 - 10), or EAU (9 -11) compared to the chatbot. GPT-3.5 had the worst readability scores at Grade 13-14 and GPT-4 was likewise less readable than urologic organization PIMs with scores of 11-13. While organizational PIMs were deemed to be accurate, the chatbot had high accuracy with minor details omitted. GPT-4 was more accurate in general stone information, dietary and medical management of kidney stones topics in comparison to GPT-3.5, while both models had the same accuracy in the surgical management of nephrolithiasis topics. CONCLUSIONS: Current PIMs from major urologic organizations for kidney stones remain more readable than publicly available GPT outputs, but they are still higher than the reading ability of the general population. Of the available PIMs for kidney stones, those from the AUA are the most readable.

We compared NAIF's performance to two existing risk score calculators, aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) and fibrosis-4 (Fib4). METHODS: To set up the algorithm for diagnosing severe liver fibrosis (defined as Fibroscan(R) values E >/= 9.7 KPa), we used 19 blood biochemistry parameters and two demographic parameters in a group of 5,962 individuals from the NHANES population (2017-2020 pre-pandemic, public database). We then assessed the algorithm's performance by comparing its accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score values to those of APRI and Fib4 scoring systems. RESULTS: In a kept-out sub dataset of the NHANES population, NAIF achieved a predictive precision of 72 %, a sensitivity of 61 %, and a specificity of 77 % in correctly identifying adults (aged 18-79 years) with severe liver fibrosis. Additionally, NAIF performed well when tested with two external datasets of Italian patients with a Fibroscan(R) score E >/= 9.7 kPa, and with an external dataset of patients with diagnosis of severe liver fibrosis through biopsy. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study suggest that NAIF, using routinely available parameters, outperforms in sensitivity existing scoring methods (Fib4 and APRI) in diagnosing severe liver fibrosis, even when tested with external validation datasets.

       " Document(page_content='The integration of digitalization and Artificial Intelligence (AI) has marked the onset of a new era of efficient sheep farming in multiple aspects ranging from the general well-being of sheep to advanced web-based management applications. The resultant improvement in sheep health and consequently better farming yield has already started to benefit both farmers and veterinarians. The predictive analytical models embedded with machine learning (giving sense to machines) has helped better decision-making and has enabled farmers to derive most out of their farms. This is evident in the ability of farmers to remotely monitor livestock health by wearable devices that keep track of animal vital signs and behaviour. Additionally, veterinarians now employ advanced AI-based diagnostics for efficient parasite detection and control. Overall, digitalization and AI have completely transformed traditional farming practices in livestock animals.

To fill this gap, this review aims to provide available digital and AI-based systems designed to aid precision farming of sheep, offering an up-to-date understanding on the subject. Various contemporary techniques, such as sky shepherding, virtual fencing, advanced parasite detection, automated counting and behaviour tracking, anomaly detection, precision nutrition, breeding support, and several mobile-based management applications are currently being utilized in sheep farms and appear to be promising.

       " Document(page_content=\"BACKGROUND: Patients and families on Intensive Care Units (ICU) benefit from ICU diaries, enhancing their coping and understanding of their experiences. Staff shortages and a limited amount of time severely restrict the application of ICU diaries. To counteract this limitation, generating diary entries from medical and nursing records using an artificial intelligence (AI) might be a solution. DESIGN AND PURPOSE: Protocol for a hypothetical multi-center, mixed method study to identify the usability and impact of AI-generated ICU diaries, compared with hand-written diaries. METHOD: A hand-written ICU diary will be written for patients with expected length of stay >/= 72 h by trained nursing staff and families. Additionally at discharge, the medical and nursing records are analyzed by an AI software, transformed into understandable, empathic diary entries, and printed as diary. Based on an appointment with patients within 3 months, diaries are read in randomized order by trained clinicians with the patients and families. Patients and families will be interviewed about their experiences of reading both diaries. In addition, usability of diaries will be evaluated by a questionnaire. EXPECTED FINDINGS AND RESULTS: Patients and families describe the similarities and differences of language and the content of the different diaries. In addition, concerns can be expressed about the generation and data processing by AI. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Professional nursing involves empathic communication, patient-centered care, and evidence-based interventions. Diaries, beneficial for ICU patients and families, could potentially be generated by Artificial Intelligence, raising ethical and professional considerations about AI's role in complementing or substituting nurses in diary writing.

       " Document(page_content='INTRODUCTION: Schistosomiasis is a significant public health concern, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. Conventional microscopy is the standard diagnostic method in resource-limited settings, but with limitations, such as the need for expert microscopists. An automated digital microscope with artificial intelligence (Schistoscope), offers a potential solution. This field study aimed to validate the diagnostic performance of the Schistoscope for detecting and quantifying Schistosoma haematobium eggs in urine compared to conventional microscopy and to a composite reference standard (CRS) consisting of real-time PCR and the up-converting particle (UCP) lateral flow (LF) test for the detection of schistosome circulating anodic antigen (CAA). METHODS: Based on a non-inferiority concept, the Schistoscope was evaluated in two parts: study A, consisting of 339 freshly collected urine samples and study B, consisting of 798 fresh urine samples that were also banked as slides for analysis with the Schistoscope. In both studies, the Schistoscope, conventional microscopy, real-time PCR and UCP-LF CAA were performed and samples with all the diagnostic test results were included in the analysis. All diagnostic procedures were performed in a laboratory located in a rural area of Gabon, endemic for S. haematobium. RESULTS: In study A and B, the Schistoscope demonstrated a sensitivity of 83.1% and 96.3% compared to conventional microscopy, and 62.9% and 78.0% compared to the CRS. The sensitivity of conventional microscopy in study A and B compared to the CRS was 61.9% and 75.2%, respectively, comparable to the Schistoscope. The specificity of the Schistoscope in study A (78.8%) was significantly lower than that of conventional microscopy (96.4%) based on the CRS but comparable in study B (90.9% and 98.0%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Overall, the performance of the Schistoscope was non-inferior to conventional microscopy with a comparable sensitivity, although the specificity varied. The Schistoscope shows promising diagnostic accuracy, particularly for samples with moderate to higher infection intensities as well as for banked sample slides, highlighting the potential for retrospective analysis in resource-limited settings.

An augmented dataset with conjunctiva images along candidates' demographic and anthropometric features under supervised learning is considered with a specific emphasis on cost-sensitive classification. METHODS: The opted decision rule classifiers use the text features, additionally the image feature 'a* value of CIELAB color space' extracted from the conjunctiva digital images as input attributes. The pre-processing consists of amalgamating text and image features on a uniform scale, normalizing. Then the 10-fold cross-validation enables the classification of samples into two categories: the presence or absence of the anemia. This study utilizes the Cost Ratio (rho) extracted from the cost matrix to meticulously monitor the Total Cost in four different cost ratio methodologies namely Uniform (U), Uniform Inverted (UI), Non-Uniform (NU), and Non-Uniform Inverted (NUI). RESULTS: It has been established that the PART classifier stands out as the top performer in this binary classification task, yielding the lowest mean total cost of 629.9 compared to other selected classifiers. Moreover, it demonstrates a comparatively lower standard deviation 335.9, and lower total cost across all four different cost ratio methodologies. The ranking of algorithm performance goes as follows: PART, JRIP, DecisionTable, and OneR. CONCLUSION: The significance of adopting a cost-sensitive learning approach is emphasized showing the PART classifier's consistent performance within the proposed framework for learning the anemia dataset. This emphasis on cost-sensitive learning not only enhances the recommendations in diagnosis but also holds the potential for substantial cost savings and makes it a noteworthy focal point in the advancement of AI-driven health care.\", metadata={'PMID': '38393866', 'TI': 'Examining different cost ratio frameworks for decision rule machine learning algorithms in diagnostic application.', 'FAU': 'Kasiviswanathan, Sivachandar Vijayan, Thulasi Bai', 'AU': 'Kasiviswanathan S Vijayan TB', 'DP': Timestamp('2024-02-07 00:00:00'), 'MH': 'None', 'OT': 'Cost matrix DecisionTable JRip OneR PART cost ratio cost sensitive classifier decision rule classifier', 'PL': 'Netherlands', 'JT': 'Technology and health care : official journal of the European Society for Engineering and Medicine', 'PMC': 'None', 'EDAT': NaT, 'MHDA': NaT, 'STAT': 'Publisher'}),\n",

These models typically utilize electronic medical records and patient registries. This study aims to broaden the application of these tools by utilizing de-identified public health datasets for notifiable sexually transmitted infections (STIs) from a southern U.S. County known for high HIV incidence rates. The goal is to assess the feasibility and accuracy of ML in predicting HIV incidence, which could potentially inform and enhance public health interventions. METHODS: We analyzed two de-identified public health datasets, spanning January 2010 to December 2021, focusing on notifiable STIs. Our process involved data processing and feature extraction, including sociodemographic factors, STI cases, and social vulnerability index (SVI) metrics. Various ML algorithms were trained and evaluated for predicting HIV incidence, using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. RESULTS: The study included 85,224 individuals, with 2,027 (2.37%) newly diagnosed with HIV during the study period. The ML models demonstrated high performance in predicting HIV incidence among males and females. Influential predictive features for males included age at STI diagnosis, previous STI information, provider type, and SVI. For females, they included age, ethnicity, previous STIs information, overall SVI, and race. CONCLUSIONS: The high accuracy of our ML models in predicting HIV incidence highlights the potential of using public health datasets for public health interventions such as tailored HIV testing and prevention.

Therefore, the primary objectives of this investigation involved examining potential differences and resemblances in alignment and structure between left and right non-osteoarthritic (native) knees in various planes (coronal, sagittal, and axial) using three-dimensional single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) images. METHODS: A total of 282 native knees from 141 patients were retrospectively gathered from the hospital's records. Patients, aged between 16 and 45, who underwent Tc99m-methyl diphosphonate SPECT/CT scans for both knees, adhering to the Imperial Knee Protocol, were included. A statistical analysis was conducted, including 23 knee morphometric parameters, comparing left and right knees, and classifying them based on functional knee phenotypes across the coronal, sagittal, and axial planes. RESULTS: Regarding the functional coronal knee phenotype, 26% of patients (n = 37) exhibited identical phenotypes in both knees (p < 0.001). Significant correlated similarities between the left and right knees were observed in the coronal plane (Pearson's r = 0.76, 0.68, 0.76, 0.76, p < 0.001) and in several morphometric measures in the sagittal plane (Pearson's r = 0.92, 0.72, 0.64, p < 0.001). Moderately correlated similarities were noted in the axial plane (Pearson's r = 0.43, 0.44, 0.43, p < 0.001).

       " Document(page_content='OBJECTIVE: Although lung cancer screening trials have showed the efficacy of computed tomography to decrease mortality compared with chest radiography, the two are widely taken as different kinds of clinical practices. Artificial intelligence can improve outcomes by detecting lung tumors in chest radiographs. Currently, artificial intelligence is used as an aid for physicians to interpret radiograms, but with the future evolution of artificial intelligence, it may become a modality that replaces physicians. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the current situation of lung cancer diagnosis by artificial intelligence. METHODS: In total, we recruited 174 consecutive patients with malignant pulmonary tumors who underwent surgery after chest radiography that was checked by artificial intelligence before surgery. Artificial intelligence diagnoses were performed using the medical image analysis software EIRL X-ray Lung Nodule version 1.12, (LPIXEL Inc., Tokyo, Japan). RESULTS: The artificial intelligence determined pulmonary tumors in 90 cases (51.7% for all patients and 57.7% excluding 18 patients with adenocarcinoma in situ). There was no significant difference in the detection rate by the artificial intelligence among histological types. All eighteen cases of adenocarcinoma in situ were not detected by either the artificial intelligence or the physicians. In a univariate analysis, the artificial intelligence could detect cases with larger histopathological tumor size (p < 0.0001), larger histopathological invasion size (p < 0.0001), and higher maximum standardized uptake values of positron emission tomography-computed tomography (p < 0.0001). In a multivariate analysis, detection by AI was significantly higher in cases with a large histopathological invasive size (p = 0.006). In 156 cases excluding adenocarcinoma in situ, we examined the rate of artificial intelligence detection based on the tumor site. Tumors in the lower lung field area were less frequently detected (p = 0.019) and tumors in the middle lung field area were more frequently detected (p = 0.014) compared with tumors in the upper lung field area. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that using artificial intelligence, the diagnosis of tumor-associated findings and the diagnosis of areas that overlap with anatomical structures is not satisfactory. While the current standing of artificial intelligence diagnostics is to assist physicians in making diagnoses, there is the possibility that artificial intelligence can substitute for humans in the future.

The literature provides the following rivalling explanations: (i) the bi-factor model represents or closely approximates the true underlying data-generating mechanism; (ii) fit indices are biased against the higher-order g factor model in favor of the bi-factor model; (iii) a network structure underlies the data. We used a Monte Carlo simulation to investigate the validity and plausibility of each of these explanations, while controlling for their rivals. To this end, we generated 1000 sample data sets according to three competing models-a bi-factor model, a (nested) higher-order factor model, and a (non-nested) network model-with 3000 data sets in total.

Conformers have the same molecular and structural formulas but different orientations of the atoms in the three-dimensional space. Moving from one conformer to another is possible without breaking covalent bonds. The interconversion is usually feasible through the thermal energy available in ordinary conditions. The behavior of most biopolymers, such as enzymes, antibodies, RNA, and DNA, is understandable if we consider that each exists as an ensemble of conformers. Each conformational collection confers multi-functionality and adaptability to the single biopolymers. The conformational distribution of any biopolymer has the features of a fuzzy set. Hence, every compound that exists as an ensemble of conformers allows the molecular implementation of a fuzzy set. Since proteins, DNA, and RNA work as fuzzy sets, it is fair to say that life\\'s logic is fuzzy.

Neurological processes have logical signal-processing and biophysical aspects, and both affect the brain\\'s structure, functioning and adaptation. Mathematical approaches based on both information and graph theory have been extensively used in an attempt to approximate its biological functioning, along with Artificial Intelligence frameworks inspired by its logical functioning. In this article, an approach to model some aspects of the brain learning and signal processing is presented, mimicking the metastability and backpropagation found in the real brain while also accounting for neuroplasticity. Several simulations are carried out with this model to demonstrate how dynamic neuroplasticity, neural inhibition and neuron migration can reshape the brain\\'s logical connectivity to synchronise signal processing and obtain certain target latencies. This work showcases the importance of dynamic logical and biophysical remodelling in brain plasticity.

Pigeon flock behavior garners significant attention as a subject of study. Collective homing flight is a commonly observed behavioral pattern in pigeon flocks. The study analyzes GPS data during the homing process and utilizes acceleration information, which better reflects the flock's movement tendencies during turns, to describe the leadership relationships within the group. By examining the evolution of acceleration during turning, the study unveils a dynamic leadership mechanism before and after turns, employing a more intricate dynamic model to depict the flock's motion. Specifically, during stable flight, pigeon flocks tend to rely on fixed leaders to guide homing flight, whereas during turns, individuals positioned in the direction of the flock's turn experience a notable increase in their leadership status. These findings suggest the existence of a dynamic leadership mechanism within pigeon flocks, enabling adaptability and stability under diverse flight conditions.

Trajectory planning of prosthesis joints plays an important role in the intelligent prosthetic control system, which directly determines the performance and helps improve comfort when wearing the prosthesis.

We present the architecture and adaptive assessment engine of PsycAssist and the two currently available tests: Adap-ToL, an adaptive version of the Tower of London-like test to assess planning skills, and MatriKS, a Raven-like test to evaluate fluid intelligence. Finally, we describe the results of an investigation of the usability of Adap-ToL and MatriKS: the evaluators perceived these tools as appropriate and well-suited for their intended purposes, and the test-takers perceived the assessment as a positive experience. To sum up, PsycAssist represents an innovative and promising tool to tailor evaluation and training to the specific characteristics of the individual, useful for clinical practice.', metadata={'PMID': '38391697', 'TI': 'PsycAssist: A Web-Based Artificial Intelligence System Designed for Adaptive Neuropsychological Assessment and Training.', 'FAU': 'de Chiusole, Debora Spinoso, Matilde Anselmi, Pasquale Bacherini, Alice Balboni, Giulia Mazzoni, Noemi Brancaccio, Andrea Epifania, Ottavia M Orsoni, Matteo Giovagnoli, Sara Garofalo, Sara Benassi, Mariagrazia Robusto, Egidio Stefanutti, Luca Pierluigi, Irene', 'AU': 'de Chiusole D Spinoso M Anselmi P Bacherini A Balboni G Mazzoni N Brancaccio A Epifania OM Orsoni M Giovagnoli S Garofalo S Benassi M Robusto E Stefanutti L Pierluigi I', 'DP': Timestamp('2024-01-24 00:00:00'), 'MH': 'None', 'OT': 'PsycAssist adaptive assessment fluid intelligence knowledge space theory planning skills', 'PL': 'Switzerland', 'JT': 'Brain sciences', 'PMC': 'PMC10886469', 'EDAT': NaT, 'MHDA': NaT, 'STAT': 'PubMed-not-MEDLINE'}),\n",

High-cellular-resolution full-field optical coherence tomography (CRFF-OCT) is emerging in pigmentary disorder assessment, but its applicability in vitiligo repigmentation after tissue grafting remains unexplored. To investigate the feasibility of CRFF-OCT for evaluating vitiligo lesions following tissue grafting, our investigation involved ten vitiligo patients who underwent suction blister epidermal grafting and laser ablation at a tertiary center between 2021 and 2022. Over a six-month period, clinical features, dermoscopy, and photography data were recorded. Utilizing CRFF-OCT along with artificial intelligence (AI) applications, repigmentation features were captured and analyzed. The CRFF-OCT analysis revealed a distinct dark band in vitiligo lesion skin, indicating melanin loss. Grafted areas exhibited melanocytes with dendrites around the epidermal-dermal junction and hair follicles. CRFF-OCT demonstrated its efficacy in the early detection of melanocyte recovery and accurate melanin quantification.

In remote or military medicine scenarios, triage is essential for identifying how to use limited resources or prioritize evacuation for the most serious cases. Ultrasound imaging, while portable and often available near the point of injury, can only be used for triage if images are properly acquired, interpreted, and objectively triage scored. Here, we detail how AI segmentation models can be used for improving image interpretation and objective triage evaluation for a medical application focused on foreign bodies embedded in tissues at variable distances from critical neurovascular features. Ultrasound images previously collected in a tissue phantom with or without neurovascular features were labeled with ground truth masks. These image sets were used to train two different segmentation AI frameworks: YOLOv7 and U-Net segmentation models. Overall, both approaches were successful in identifying shrapnel in the image set, with U-Net outperforming YOLOv7 for single-class segmentation. Both segmentation models were also evaluated with a more complex image set containing shrapnel, artery, vein, and nerve features. YOLOv7 obtained higher precision scores across multiple classes whereas U-Net achieved higher recall scores. Using each AI model, a triage distance metric was adapted to measure the proximity of shrapnel to the nearest neurovascular feature, with U-Net more closely mirroring the triage distances measured from ground truth labels.

Knowing the kinesthetic markers of normal gait is essential for the diagnosis of certain pathologies or the generation of intelligent ortho-prostheses for the treatment or prevention of gait disorders. The aim of the present study was to identify the key features of normal human gait using inertial unit (IMU) recordings in a walking test. METHODS: Gait analysis was conducted on 32 healthy participants (age range 19-29 years) at speeds of 2 km/h and 4 km/h using a treadmill. Dynamic data were obtained using a microcontroller (Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense Rev2) with IMU sensors (BMI270). The collected data were processed and analyzed using a custom script (MATLAB 2022b), including the labeling of the four relevant gait phases and events (Stance, Toe-Off, Swing, and Heel Strike), computation of statistical features (64 features), and application of machine learning techniques for classification (8 classifiers). RESULTS: Spider plot analysis revealed significant differences in the four events created by the most relevant statistical features. Among the different classifiers tested, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model using a Cubic kernel achieved an accuracy rate of 92.4% when differentiating between gait events using the computed statistical features. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies the optimal features of acceleration and gyroscope data during normal gait. The findings suggest potential applications for injury prevention and performance optimization in individuals engaged in activities involving normal gait. The creation of spider plots is proposed to obtain a personalised fingerprint of each patient's gait fingerprint that could be used as a diagnostic tool.

The performance capacity of LSTM-MPA was evaluated with other artificial intelligence models. The results indicate that the R(2) and RMSE values for the proposed LSTM-MPA model were as follows: MLPNN (R(2) = 0.896, RMSE = 3.745), BRNN (R(2) = 0.931, RMSE = 2.785), GFFNN (R(2) = 0.926, RMSE = 2.926), SVR-L (R(2) = 0.921, RMSE = 3.017), SVR-P (R(2) = 0.920, RMSE = 3.291), SVR-S (R(2) = 0.934, RMSE = 2.823), SVR-RBF (R(2) = 0.916, RMSE = 3.114), DT (R(2) = 0.934, RMSE = 2.711), RF (R(2) = 0.938, RMSE = 2.892), LSTM (R(2) = 0.9725, RMSE = 1.7816), LSTM-MPA (R(2) = 0.9940, RMSE = 0.8332), and LSTM-PSO (R(2) = 0.9804, RMSE = 1.5221). Therefore, the proposed LSTM-MPA model can be employed as a reliable and accurate model for predicting CSFAG. Noteworthy, the results demonstrated the significance and influence of fly ash and sodium silicate solution chemical compositions on the compressive strength of FAGC.

Its early identification and prognosis, which have become a requirement of cancer research, are essential for clinical treatment. Patients have already benefited greatly from the use of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) algorithms in the field of healthcare. AI simulates and combines data, pre-programmed rules, and knowledge to produce predictions. Data are used to improve efficiency across several pursuits and tasks through the art of ML. DL is a larger family of ML methods based on representational learning and simulated neural networks. Support vector machines, convulsion neural networks, and artificial neural networks, among others, have been widely used in cancer research to construct prediction models that enable precise and effective decision-making. Although using these innovative methods can enhance our comprehension of how cancer progresses, further validation is required before these techniques can be used in routine clinical practice. We cover contemporary methods used in the modelling of cancer development in this article. The presented prediction models are built using a variety of guided ML approaches, as well as numerous input attributes and data collections. Early identification and cost-effective detection of cancer's progression are equally necessary for successful treatment of the disease. Smart material-based detection techniques can give end consumers a portable, affordable instrument to easily detect and monitor their health issues without the need for specialized knowledge. Owing to their cost-effectiveness, excellent sensitivity, multimodal detection capacity, and miniaturization aptitude, two-dimensional (2D) materials have a lot of prospects for clinical examination of various compounds as well as cancer biomarkers.

METHODS: We randomly selected 20 cases of corneal diseases including corneal infections, dystrophies, and degenerations from a publicly accessible online database from the University of Iowa. We then input the text of each case description into ChatGPT-4.0 and ChatGPT-3.5 and asked for a provisional diagnosis. We finally evaluated the responses based on the correct diagnoses, compared them with the diagnoses made by 3 corneal specialists (human experts), and evaluated interobserver agreements. RESULTS: The provisional diagnosis accuracy based on ChatGPT-4.0 was 85% (17 correct of 20 cases), whereas the accuracy of ChatGPT-3.5 was 60% (12 correct cases of 20).

       " Document(page_content=\"AIM: To examine the impact of six areas of work-life, emotional intelligence and psychological capital on compassion fatigue and compassion satisfaction among Canadian Registered Nurses and licensed practical nurses. DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey study. METHODS: A convenience sample of 296 Registered Nurses and 110 licensed practical nurses answered a self-administered questionnaire measuring areas of work-life, psychological capital, emotional intelligence, compassion satisfaction and compassion fatigue in September 2019. The association between variables were analysed with descriptive and correlational analyses, while the hypothesized models were tested using multiple regression analyses. RESULTS: This study identified several areas of work-life and intrapersonal resources that impacted compassion satisfaction and compassion fatigue. Among Registered Nurses, compassion satisfaction was predicted by psychological capital, rewards, values and workload. Compassion fatigue was predicted by psychological capital, workload, control and community. Among licensed practical nurses, compassion satisfaction was predicted by psychological capital and emotional intelligence. Compassion fatigue was predicted by workload and psychological capital. Study results also revealed significant differences in Registered Nurses' and licensed practical nurses' perceptions of workload, rewards and fairness at work, and both compassion satisfaction and compassion fatigue. Registered Nurses perceived their workload to be more manageable and perceived greater rewards and greater fairness at work than licensed practical nurses. Compassion fatigue was higher for Registered Nurses than licensed practical nurses, while compassion satisfaction was higher for licensed practical nurses than Registered Nurses. Future studies should investigate the nature and span of these differences to suggest relevant strategies to mitigate compassion fatigue and promote compassion satisfaction for each of these nursing roles. CONCLUSION: The results of this study underscore the need to create nursing work environments that foster a manageable workload and positive social relationships, where nurses have professional autonomy, decision-making capacities and access to adequate resources to do their job effectively. The nursing work environment should also provide recognition of nurses' contributions and an alignment between personal and organizational values. Investments in the development and improvement of nurses' psychological capital and emotional intelligence should be prioritized since they are malleable and impactful intrapersonal resources on compassion satisfaction and compassion fatigue.

However, historically,  approximately 75% of ILR alerts are false positives, requiring significant time and effort for adjudication. The LINQII and LUX-Dx are remotely reprogrammable ILRs with dual-stage algorithms using artificial intelligence to reduce false positives, but their utility in routine clinical practice has not been studied. METHODS AND RESULTS: We identified patients with the LINQII and LUX-Dx who were monitored by the Veterans Affairs National Cardiac Device Surveillance Program between March and June 2022. ILR programming was customized on the basis of implant indication. All alerts and every 90-day scheduled transmissions were manually reviewed. ILRs were remotely reprogrammed, as appropriate, after false-positive alerts or 2 consecutive same-type alerts, unless there was ongoing clinical need for that alert. Outcomes were total number of transmissions and false positives. We performed medical record review to determine if patients experienced any adverse clinical events, including hospitalization and mortality. Among 117 LINQII patients, there were 239 total alerts, 43 (18.0%) of which were false positives. Among 105 LUX-Dx patients, there were 300 total alerts, 115 (38.3%) of which were false positives. LINQIIs were reprogrammed 22 times, resulting in a decrease in median alerts/day from 0.13 to 0.03. LUX-Dx ILRs were reprogrammed 52 times, resulting in a decrease from 0.15 to 0.01 median alerts/day. There were no adverse clinical events that could have been identified by superior or earlier arrhythmia detection.

This study sought to evaluate the prognostic value of several artificial intelligence-augmented ECG (AI-ECG) algorithms in patients with TC. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study examined consecutive patients in the prospective and observational Mayo Clinic Takotsubo syndrome registry. Several previously validated AI-ECG algorithms were used for the estimation of ECG- age, probability of low ejection fraction, and probability of atrial fibrillation. Multivariable models were constructed to evaluate the association of AI-ECG and other clinical characteristics with major adverse cardiac events, defined as cardiovascular death, recurrence of TC, nonfatal myocardial infarction, hospitalization for congestive heart failure, and stroke. In the final analysis, 305 patients with TC were studied over a median follow-up of 4.8 years. Patients with future major adverse cardiac events were more likely to be older, have a history of hypertension, congestive heart failure, worse renal function, as well as high-risk AI-ECG findings compared with those without. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards analysis indicated that the presence of 2 or 3 high-risk findings detected by AI-ECG remained a significant predictor of major adverse cardiac events in patients with TC after adjustment by conventional risk factors (hazard ratio, 4.419 [95% CI, 1.833-10.66], P=0.001).

       " Document(page_content='OBJECTIVE: Malingering of neuropsychological damage is common among traumatic brain injury patients pursuing disability compensation in forensic contexts. There is an urgent need to explore differences in neuropsychological assessment outcomes with different levels of cooperation. METHODS: A total of 420 participants with severe traumatic brain injury were classified into malingering group, partial cooperation group, and complete cooperation group according to the Binomial forced-choice digit memory test. The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, event-related potential component, and Symptom Checklist 90 were applied subsequently to assess the psychological status of participants. RESULTS: Participants in the malingering group presented lower scores in the binomial forced-choice digit memory test and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, lower P3 amplitude, and simultaneously higher scores in the Symptom Checklist 90 than the other two groups. The actual intelligence quotient of participants with malingering tendencies ranged mostly between normal and marginal damage, and they often reported elevated whole scale scores in the Symptom Checklist 90. The Cooperation Index (defined as the ratio of positive symptom distress index to global severity index, CI) was proposed and validated to function as an embedded validity indicator of the Symptom Checklist 90, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.938. When valued at 1.28, CI has the highest classification ability in differentiating malingering from non-malingering. Combined with the CI and P3 amplitude, the area under the ROC curve for malingering diagnosis further reached 0.952. CONCLUSION: Any non-optimal effort in a forensic context will lead to unexpected deviation in psychology evaluation results.

Through a human-centered design process, we developed a tool that allows users to effectively navigate through and explore complex hierarchical concepts in three kinds of traversal techniques: top-down, middle-out, and bottom-up. Our concept hierarchies offer an overview over a given domain, with increasing level of detail toward the bottom of the hierarchy which is consisting of entities. In the legal use case we considered, the concepts were adapted from section headings in a legal textbook, whereas references to law or legal cases inside the textbook became entities. The design of this tool is refined following various steps such as gathering user needs, pain points of an existing visualization, prototyping, testing, and refining. The resulting interface offers users several key features such as dynamic search and filter, explorable concept nodes, and a preview of leaf nodes at every stage. A high-fidelity prototype was created to test our theory and design. To test our concept, we used the System Usability Scale as a way to measure the prototype's usability, a task-based survey to asses the tool's ability in assisting users in gathering information and interacting with the prototype, and finally mouse tracking to understand user interaction patterns. Along with this, we gathered audio and video footage of users when participating in the study. This footage also helped us in getting feedback when the survey responses required further information. The data collected provided valuable insights to set the directions for extending this study. As a result, we have accounted for varying hierarchy depths, longer text spans than only one to two words in the elements of the hierarchy, searchability, and exploration of the hierarchies.

The findings demonstrated that:1)SR-PCI-CT imaging effectively depicted the morphological attributes of different types of callus of fracture healing. The grayscale values of different types of callus were significantly different(P < 0.01).2)In comparison to the SF group, the DF group exhibited a significant reduction in the total amount of callus during the same period (P < 0.01). Additionally, the peak of cartilage callus in the hypertrophic phase was delayed.3)Histology provides the basis for training algorithms for deep learning image segmentation models. The deep-learning image segmentation models achieved accuracies of 0.69, 0.81 and 0.733 for reserve/proliferative cartilage, hypertrophic cartilage and mineralized cartilage, respectively, in the test set. The corresponding Dice values were 0.72, 0.83 and 0.76, respectively. In summary, SR-PCI-CT images are close to the histological level, and a variety of cartilage can be identified on synchrotron radiation CT images compared with histological examination, while artificial intelligence image segmentation model can realize automatic analysis and data generation through deep learning, and further determine the objectivity and accuracy of SR-PCI-CT in identifying various cartilage tissues.

       " Document(page_content='Background Acid-fast bacilli Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium leprae are the causative organisms behind two major diseases of developing nations, tuberculosis and leprosy, respectively. To efficiently tackle these diseases in developing nations, drugs must be augmented with improved detection modalities. This necessitates the development of enhanced tools that can aid the current detection modalities being used in high-incidence areas. A no-code artificial intelligence model based on image classification is one such tool that can be used in the identification of acid-fast bacilli. This study utilizes three such no-code artificial intelligence models that originate from three different platforms but share identical training, testing, and subsequent evaluation. Thereafter, the study is directed at comparing the three models created and identifying the one that can function as a promising support system for the detection of acid-fast bacilli. Methods To begin with, a total of 1000 images per class, i.e., positive and negative for each disease, were captured from the diagnosed slides of tuberculosis and leprosy, taken from the Department of Pathology. Subsequently, these slides were reviewed again by a pathologist to demarcate them as positive or negative for acid-fast bacilli. Once the required number of images was captured, 600 images of each class were selected as the training set, 300 images as the testing set, and the remaining 100 images as the evaluation set. Data augmentation was then performed using techniques such as rotating, mirroring, cropping, and position shifting. These designated data sets were then used to train the image classification software available on the following three platforms: Lobe (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington, United States), Create ML (Apple Inc., Cupertino, California, United States), Python-based open-source software (PerceptiLabs, Stockholm, Sweden). The final evaluation was based on different parameters such as sensitivity, specificity, ease of use, learning curve, technological resources required, and feasibility of implementation. All parameters put together served the purpose of comparison to identify the most promising model. Results Out of the three models tested, the one built using Lobe is the most promising in terms of the evaluation parameters considered. For tuberculosis, the sensitivity and specificity values obtained were 96% each, while for leprosy, they were 100% and 96%, respectively. Also, the model built using Lobe had a near-negligible learning curve, in addition to being the most cost-effective and feasible model to implement. Furthermore, it had a unique real-time training feature, which constantly improved the model throughout the testing period, till the final sensitivity and specificity values were achieved. Conclusions In clinical situations where a high number of cases are encountered each day, a no-code artificial intelligence model built using Lobe would get exposed to a huge database, getting trained in real time. Subsequently, such a model would reach considerable levels of sensitivity and specificity and in turn, act as a promising support system for the detection of acid-fast bacilli.', metadata={'PMID': '38389642', 'TI': 'Performance Evaluation of No-Code Artificial Intelligence Models for the Detection of Acid-Fast Bacilli: A Comparative Analysis of Three Models.', 'FAU': 'Arya, Yash Konduru, Anil R', 'AU': 'Arya Y Konduru AR', 'DP': NaT, 'MH': 'None', 'OT': 'acid-fast bacilli convolutional neural network mycobacterium leprae mycobacterium tuberculosis no-code artificial intelligence real-time training', 'PL': 'United States', 'JT': 'Cureus', 'PMC': 'PMC10882636', 'EDAT': NaT, 'MHDA': NaT, 'STAT': 'PubMed-not-MEDLINE'}),\n",

Over the last two decades, the advent of AI into numerous aspects of pathology has opened transformative possibilities in how we practise laboratory medicine. Objectives of this study were to explore how AI could impact the clinical practices of professionals working in Clinical Chemistry laboratories, while also identifying effective strategies in medical education to facilitate the required changes. METHODS: From March to August 2022, an exploratory qualitative study was conducted at the Section of Clinical Chemistry, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Aga Khan University, Karachi, Pakistan, in collaboration with Keele University, Newcastle, United Kingdom. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to collect information from diverse group of professionals working in Clinical Chemistry laboratories. All interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. They were asked what changes AI would involve in the laboratory, what resources would be necessary, and how medical education would assist them in adapting to the change. A content analysis was conducted, resulting in the development of codes and themes based on the analyzed data. RESULTS: The interviews were analysed to identify three primary themes: perspectives and considerations for AI adoption, educational and curriculum adjustments, and implementation techniques. Although the use of diagnostic algorithms is currently limited in Pakistani Clinical Chemistry laboratories, the application of AI is expanding. All thirteen participants stated their reasons for being hesitant to use AI. Participants stressed the importance of critical aspects for effective AI deployment, the need of a collaborative integrative approach, and the need for constant horizon scanning to keep up with AI developments.

Therefore, we evaluated an AI-based clinical trial matching system (CTMS) that extracts medical data from the electronic health record system and matches them to clinical trials automatically. METHODS: This study included 1,053 consecutive inpatients primarily diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma who were referred to the liver tumor center of an academic medical center in China between January and December 2019. The eligibility criteria extracted from two clinical trials, patient attributes, and gold standard were decided manually. We evaluated the performance of the CTMS against the established gold standard by measuring the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and run time required. RESULTS: The manual reviewers demonstrated acceptable interrater reliability (Cohen's kappa 0.65-0.88).

METHODS: A study was conducted to analyze 90 SBCE cases in which a small bowel examination was completed. Two experienced endoscopists alternately performed two types of readings. They used the AI algorithm to remove poorly visualized images for the frame reduction reading (AI user group) and conducted whole frame reading without AI (AI non-user group) for the same patient.

Since trainees and supervisors both contribute to entrustment decisions, we examined the cognitive and affective factors that underly their negotiation of trust, and whether trainee demographic characteristics may bias them. Using a document analysis approach, we adapted large language models (LLMs) to examine feedback dialogs (N = 24,187, each with an associated entrustment rating) between medical student trainees and their clinical supervisors. We compared how trainees and supervisors differentially documented feedback dialogs about similar tasks by identifying qualitative themes and quantitatively assessing their correlation with entrustment ratings. Supervisors' themes predominantly reflected skills related to patient presentations, while trainees' themes were broader-including clinical performance and personal qualities. To examine affect, we trained an LLM to measure feedback sentiment. On average, trainees used more negative language (5.3% lower probability of positive sentiment, p < 0.05) compared to supervisors, while documenting higher entrustment ratings (+ 0.08 on a 1-4 scale, p < 0.05). We also found biases tied to demographic characteristics: trainees' documentation reflected more positive sentiment in the case of male trainees (+ 1.3%, p < 0.05) and of trainees underrepresented in medicine (UIM) (+ 1.3%, p < 0.05). Entrustment ratings did not appear to reflect these biases, neither when documented by trainee nor supervisor.

       " Document(page_content=\"OBJECTIVE: This study analyzes the potential cost-effectiveness of integrating an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted system into the differentiation of incidental renal lesions as benign or malignant on MR images during follow-up. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For estimation of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and lifetime costs, a decision model was created, including the MRI strategy and MRI + AI strategy. Model input parameters were derived from recent literature. Willingness to pay (WTP) was set to $100,000/QALY. Costs of $0 for the AI were assumed in the base-case scenario. Model uncertainty and costs of the AI system were assessed using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: Average total costs were at $8054 for the MRI strategy and $7939 for additional use of an AI-based algorithm. The model yielded a cumulative effectiveness of 8.76 QALYs for the MRI strategy and of 8.77 for the MRI + AI strategy. The economically dominant strategy was MRI + AI. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed high robustness of the model with the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), which represents the incremental cost associated with one additional QALY gained, remaining below the WTP for variation of the input parameters. If increasing costs for the algorithm, the ICER of $0/QALY was exceeded at $115, and the defined WTP was exceeded at $667 for the use of the AI. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis, rooted in assumptions, suggests that the additional use of an AI-based algorithm may be a potentially cost-effective alternative in the differentiation of incidental renal lesions using MRI and needs to be confirmed in the future.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 22,621 mammograms of 8825 women within a 10-year biennial two-reader screening program. The statistical analysis focused on 5136 mammograms from 4282 women due to data retrieval issues, among whom 105 were diagnosed with breast cancer. The AI software assigned scores from 1 to 100. Histopathology results determined the ground truth, and Youden's index was used to establish a threshold. Tumor characteristics were analyzed with ANOVA and chi-squared test, and different workflow scenarios were evaluated using bootstrapping. RESULTS: The AI software achieved an AUC of 89.6% (86.1-93.2%, 95% CI). The optimal threshold was 30.44, yielding 72.38% sensitivity and 92.86% specificity. Initially, AI identified 57 screening-detected cancers (83.82%), 15 interval cancers (51.72%), and 4 missed cancers (50%). AI as a second reader could have led to earlier diagnosis in 24 patients (average 29.92 +/- 19.67 months earlier). No significant differences were found in cancer-characteristics groups. A hybrid triage workflow scenario showed a potential 69.5% reduction in workload and a 30.5% increase in accuracy. CONCLUSION: This AI system exhibits high sensitivity and specificity in screening mammograms, effectively identifying interval and missed cancers and identifying 23% of cancers earlier in prior mammograms. Adopting AI as a triage mechanism has the potential to reduce workload by nearly 70%. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: The study proposes a more efficient method for screening programs, both in terms of workload and accuracy. KEY POINTS: * Incorporating AI as a triage tool in screening workflow improves sensitivity (72.38%) and specificity (92.86%), enhancing detection rates for interval and missed cancers. * AI-assisted triaging is effective in differentiating low and high-risk cases, reduces radiologist workload, and potentially enables broader screening coverage. * AI has the potential to facilitate early diagnosis compared to human reading.\", metadata={'PMID': '38388718', 'TI': 'Diagnostic capabilities of artificial intelligence as an additional reader in a breast cancer screening program.', 'FAU': 'Seker, Mustafa Ege Koyluoglu, Yilmaz Onat Ozaydin, Ayse Nilufer Gurdal, Sibel Ozkan Ozcinar, Beyza Cabioglu, Neslihan Ozmen, Vahit Aribal, Erkin', 'AU': 'Seker ME Koyluoglu YO Ozaydin AN Gurdal SO Ozcinar B Cabioglu N Ozmen V Aribal E', 'DP': Timestamp('2024-02-22 00:00:00'), 'MH': 'None', 'OT': 'Artificial intelligence Breast cancer Mammography Screening', 'PL': 'Germany', 'JT': 'European radiology', 'PMC': 'None', 'EDAT': NaT, 'MHDA': NaT, 'STAT': 'Publisher'}),\n",

Methods: We trained and evaluated deep learning methods using retrospectively included scans of HNC patients referred for radiotherapy between January 2014 and December 2019 (ISRCTN16907234). We used 3 test datasets: an internal set to compare methods, another internal set to compare AI-to-expert variability and expert interobserver variability (IOV), and an external set to compare internal and external AI-to-expert variability. Expert PET GTVs were used as the reference standard. Our benchmark IOV was measured using the PET GTV of 6 experts. The primary outcome was the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). ANOVA was used to compare methods, a paired t test was used to compare AI-to-expert variability and expert IOV, an unpaired t test was used to compare internal and external AI-to-expert variability, and post hoc Bland-Altman analysis was used to evaluate biomarker agreement.

In this crucial period, the promotion of prosocial behaviours and the development of emotional intelligence are understood as key factors influencing adolescents' psychological and personal well-being. The general objective of this study was to find out the relationship between these two variables - prosocial behaviours and emotional intelligence - and their correlation with the maintenance of a healthy lifestyle and another fundamental aspect such as violence among young people in the academic context. A total of 743 secondary school students participated in this research with a descriptive-cross-sectional design.

The results highlighted a convincing link between the display of prosocial behaviours and emotional intelligence with various dimensions of healthy living such as healthy diet or respect for mealtimes. In particular, the research revealed a pronounced correlation between adolescents who showed greater emotional repair and respect and their lower involvement in school violence and substance use. In addition, the likelihood of having a healthy life was found to be linked to variables such as being male, respect, social relationships and emotional repair.

It also has economic consequences for society, with increasing expenses since 2011 (+4.9% on average per year). Investing in preventive actions against the loss of the ability to work should limit these consequences, but it requires targeting people at risk. The development of artificial intelligence opens up prospects in this regard. PURPOSE OF THE RESEARCH: To target, using supervised machine learning methods, those people with a high probability of becoming eligible for the disability pension over the course of the year based on their socio-demographic and medical characteristics (pathologies, work stoppages, drugs taken, and medical procedures). METHOD: Among the beneficiaries of the French public welfare system aged 20-64 in 2017, we compared the socio-demographic and medical characteristics between 2014 and 2016 of those who received a disability pension in 2017 and not before, and those who did not receive a disability pension from 2014 to 2017. The determination of the boundary between these two groups was tested using logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, naive Bayes classifiers, and support vector machines. The models' performance was compared with respect to accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC (area under the curve). Finally, the predictive power of each factor was measured by AUC too. RESULTS: The boosted logistic regression had the best performance for three of the five criteria, but low sensitivity. The best sensitivity was obtained with the support vector machines, with an accuracy close to that of the boosted logistic regression, but a lower precision and specificity. Random forests offered the best discriminatory ability. The naive Bayes classifier had the worst performance. The most predictive factors in becoming eligible for the disability pension were having 30 days or more off sick in 2014, 2015, and 2016 and being aged 55 to 64.

It examines the various applications of AI across diverse aspects of BC pathology, highlighting key findings from multiple studies. Integrating AI into routine pathology practice stands to improve diagnostic accuracy, thereby contributing to reducing avoidable errors. Additionally, AI has excelled in identifying invasive breast tumors and lymph node metastasis through its capacity to process large whole-slide images adeptly. Adaptive sampling techniques and powerful convolutional neural networks mark these achievements. The evaluation of hormonal status, which is imperative for BC treatment choices, has also been enhanced by AI quantitative analysis, aiding interobserver concordance and reliability. Breast cancer grading and mitotic count evaluation also benefit from AI intervention. AI-based frameworks effectively classify breast carcinomas, even for moderately graded cases that traditional methods struggle with. Moreover, AI-assisted mitotic figures quantification surpasses manual counting in precision and sensitivity, fostering improved prognosis. The assessment of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in triple-negative breast cancer using AI yields insights into patient survival prognosis. Furthermore, AI-powered predictions of neoadjuvant chemotherapy response demonstrate potential for streamlining treatment strategies. Addressing limitations, such as preanalytical variables, annotation demands, and differentiation challenges, is pivotal for realizing AI's full potential in BC pathology.

OBJECTIVE.-: To design and validate a deep learning model tailored to predict metastatic SCC in radical lymph node dissection specimens, using whole slide images (WSIs). DESIGN.-: Using the EfficientNetB1 architecture, a model was trained on 6587 WSIs (2413 SCC and 4174 nonneoplastic) from several hospitals, encompassing esophagus, head and neck, lung, and skin specimens. The training exclusively relied on WSI-level labels without annotations. We evaluated the model on a test set consisting of 541 WSIs (41 SCC and 500 nonneoplastic) of radical lymph node dissection specimens. RESULTS.-: The model exhibited high performance, with receiver operating characteristic curve areas under the curve between 0.880 and 0.987 in detecting SCC metastases in lymph nodes. Although true positives and negatives were accurately identified, certain limitations were observed. These included false positives due to germinal centers, dust cell aggregations, and specimen-handling artifacts, as well as false negatives due to poor differentiation.

These factors have not been thoroughly examined before. METHODS: This study conducted a comprehensive re-analysis of the CATIE data using machine learning techniques, in particular Conditional Inference Tree (CTREE) analysis, to investigate associations between neurocognitive functions and moderating factors such as estimated trough dopamine D(2) receptor blockade with risperidone, olanzapine, or ziprasidone, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), and baseline IQ in 573 patients with schizophrenia. RESULTS: The study reveals that IQ, age, and education consistently emerge as significant predictors across all neurocognitive domains. Furthermore, higher severity of PANSS-negative symptoms was associated with lower cognitive performance scores in several domains. CTREE analysis, in combination with a genetic algorithm approach, has been identified as particularly insightful for illustrating complex interactions between variables. Lower neurocognitive function was associated with factors such as age>52 years, IQ<94/95,<12/13 education years, and more pronounced negative symptoms (score<26). CONCLUSIONS: These findings emphasize the multifaceted nature of neurocognitive functioning in patients with schizophrenia, with the PANSS-negative score being an important predictor.

Thanks to it, classification models have been trained in a single center before assessing its performance in other centers images. This setting led to extensively monitor bias reduction while providing accurate insight of both augmentation and normalization methods. AugmentHE provided an 81% increase in color dispersion compared to geometric augmentations only. In addition, every classification model that involved AugmentHE presented a significant increase in the area under receiving operator characteristic curve (AUC) over the widely used RGB shift. More precisely, AugmentHE-based models showed at least 0.14 AUC increase over RGB shift-based models. Regarding normalization, HEnorm appeared to be up to 78x faster than conventional methods. It also provided satisfying results in terms of bias reduction. Altogether, our pipeline composed of AugmentHE and HEnorm improved AUC on biased data by up to 21.7% compared to usual augmentations. Conventional normalization methods coupled with AugmentHE yielded similar results while being much slower. In conclusion, we have validated an open-source tool that can be used in any deep learning-based digital pathology project on H&E whole slide images (WSI) that efficiently reduces stain-induced bias and later on might help increase pathologists' confidence when using AI-based products.\", metadata={'PMID': '38387381', 'TI': 'Bias reduction using combined stain normalization and augmentation for AI-based classification of histological images.', 'FAU': 'Franchet, Camille Schwob, Robin Bataillon, Guillaume Syrykh, Charlotte Pericart, Sarah Frenois, Francois-Xavier Penault-Llorca, Frederique Lacroix-Triki, Magali Arnould, Laurent Lemonnier, Jerome Alliot, Jean-Marc Filleron, Thomas Brousset, Pierre', 'AU': 'Franchet C Schwob R Bataillon G Syrykh C Pericart S Frenois FX Penault-Llorca F Lacroix-Triki M Arnould L Lemonnier J Alliot JM Filleron T Brousset P', 'DP': Timestamp('2024-02-08 00:00:00'), 'MH': 'None', 'OT': 'Bias mitigation Color-induced bias Data augmentation Deep learning Histopathology Normalization', 'PL': 'United States', 'JT': 'Computers in biology and medicine', 'PMC': 'None', 'EDAT': NaT, 'MHDA': NaT, 'STAT': 'Publisher'}),\n",

Some evidence suggests that higher pCRH exposure during gestation is associated with adverse neurodevelopment, particularly in female offspring. In 858 mother-child dyads from the sociodemographically diverse CANDLE cohort (Memphis, TN), we examined: (1) the slope of pCRH rise in mid-late pregnancy and (2) estimated pCRH at delivery as a measure of cumulative prenatal exposure. When children were 4 years-old, mothers reported on problem behaviors using the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and cognitive performance was assessed by trained psychologists using the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales. We fitted linear regression models examining pCRH in relation to behavioral and cognitive performance measures, adjusting for covariates. Using interaction models, we evaluated whether associations differed by fetal sex, breastfeeding, and postnatal neighborhood opportunity. In the full cohort, log-transformed pCRH measures were not associated with outcomes; however, we observed sex differences in some models (interaction p-values</=0.01).

The objective of this study is to create and validate an artificial intelligence (AI) model that can accurately predict early mortality among critical fracture patients. METHODS: A total of 2662 critically ill patients with orthopaedic trauma were included from the MIMIC III database. Early mortality was defined as death within 30 days in this study. The patients were randomly divided into a model training cohort and a model validation cohort. Various algorithms, including logistic regression (LR), extreme gradient boosting machine (eXGBM), decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and neural network (NN), were employed. Evaluation metrics, including discrimination and calibration, were used to develop a comprehensive scoring system ranging from 0 to 60, with higher scores indicating better prediction performance. Furthermore, external validation was carried out using 131 patients. The optimal model was deployed as an internet-based AI tool. RESULTS: Among all models, the eXGBM demonstrated the highest area under the curve (AUC) value (0.974, 95%CI: 0.959-0.983), followed by the RF model (0.951, 95%CI: 0.935-0.967) and the NN model (0.922, 95%CI: 0.905-0.941). Additionally, the eXGBM model outperformed other models in terms of accuracy (0.915), precision (0.906), recall (0.926), F1 score (0.916), Brier score (0.062), log loss (0.210), and discrimination slope (0.767). Based on the scoring system, the eXGBM model achieved the highest score (53), followed by RF (42) and NN (39). The LR, DT, and SVM models obtained scores of 28, 18, and 32, respectively. Decision curve analysis further confirmed the superior clinical net benefits of the eXGBM model. External validation of the model achieved an AUC value of 0.913 (95%CI: 0.878-0.948). Consequently, the model was deployed on the Internet at https://30-daymortalityincriticallyillpatients-fnfsynbpbp6rgineaspuim.streamlit.app/, allowing users to input patient features and obtain predicted risks of early mortality among critical fracture patients. Furthermore, the AI model successfully stratified patients into low or high risk of early mortality based on a predefined threshold and provided recommendations for appropriate therapeutic interventions. CONCLUSION: This study successfully develops and validates an AI model, with the eXGBM algorithm demonstrating the highest predictive performance for early mortality in critical fracture patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases up to December 2022 were searched in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) statement. Risk of analysis was used for all identified articles. Predictive performance values, including sensitivity and specificity, were extracted for quantitative analysis. The meta-analysis was divided between AI prediction models identifying the presence of meniscus tears and the location of meniscus tears. RESULTS: Eleven articles were included in the final review, with a total of 13,467 patients and 57,551 images. Heterogeneity was statistically significantly large for the sensitivity of the tear identification analysis (I(2) = 79%). A higher level of accuracy was observed in identifying the presence of a meniscal tear over locating tears in specific regions of the meniscus (AUC, 0.939 vs 0.905). Pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.87 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80-0.91) and 0.89 (95% CI 0.83-0.93) for meniscus tear identification and 0.88 (95% CI 0.82-0.91) and 0.84 (95% CI 0.81-0.85) for locating the tears. CONCLUSIONS: AI prediction models achieved favorable performance in the diagnosis, but not location, of meniscus tears. Further studies on the clinical utilities of deep learning should include standardized reporting, external validation, and full reports of the predictive performances of these models, with a view to localizing tears more accurately.

Although semantic segmentation models (SSMs) could potentially overcome this limitation, existing facial SSMs distinguish only three to nine facial zones of interest. METHODS: We developed a new supervised SSM, trained on 669 high-resolution clinical-grade facial images; a subset of these images was used in an iterative process between facial aesthetics experts and manual annotators that defined and labeled 33 facial zones of interest. RESULTS: Because some zones overlap, some pixels are included in multiple zones, violating the one-to-one relationship between a given pixel and a specific class (zone) required for SSMs. The full facial zone model was therefore used to create three sub-models, each with completely non-overlapping zones, generating three outputs for each input image that can be treated as standalone models. For each facial zone, the output demonstrating the best Intersection Over Union (IOU) value was selected as the winning prediction.

       " Document(page_content='INTRODUCTION: The use of existing data to provide surveillance intelligence is widely advocated but often presents considerable challenges. Two data sources could be used as proxies for the mortality experienced by the Scottish cattle population: deaths recorded in the mandatory register [Cattle Tracing System (CTS)] and fallen stock collections by the National Fallen Stock Company (NSFCo) with a nationwide voluntary membership. METHODS: Data for the period 2011-2016 were described and compared to establish their strengths and limitations. Similarities and differences in their temporal, seasonal and spatial patterns were examined overall, at postcode area level and for different age groups. Temporal aberration detection algorithms (TADA) were fitted. RESULTS: Broadly, similar patterns were observed in the two datasets; however, there were some notable differences. The observed seasonal, annual and spatial patterns match expectations, given knowledge of Scottish cattle production systems. The registry data provide more comprehensive coverage of all areas of Scotland, while collections data provide a more comprehensive measure of the mortality experienced in 0-1-month-old calves. DISCUSSION: Consequently, estimates of early calf mortality and their impact on the livestock sector made using CTS, or successor registers, will be under-estimates. This may apply to other registry-based systems. Fitted TADA detected points of deviations from expected norms some of which coincided in the two datasets; one with a known external event that caused increased mortality. We have demonstrated that both data sources do have the potential to be utilized to provide measures of mortality in the Scottish cattle population that could inform surveillance activities. While neither is perfect, they are complementary. Each has strengths and weaknesses, so ideally, a system where they are analyzed and interpreted in parallel would optimize the information obtained for surveillance purposes for epidemiologists, risk managers, animal health policy-makers and the wider livestock industry sector.

       " Document(page_content='INTRODUCTION: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a prevalent condition often associated with a decline in patients\\' physical function. Objective self-assessment of physical conditions poses challenges for many advanced KOA patients. To address this, we explored the potential of a computer vision method to facilitate home-based physical function self-assessments. METHODS: We developed and validated a simple at-home artificial intelligence approach to recognize joint stiffness levels and physical function in individuals with advanced KOA. One hundred and four knee osteoarthritis (KOA) patients were enrolled, and we employed the WOMAC score to evaluate their physical function and joint stiffness. Subsequently, patients independently recorded videos of five sit-to-stand tests in a home setting. Leveraging the AlphaPose and VideoPose algorithms, we extracted time-series data from these videos, capturing three-dimensional spatiotemporal information reflecting changes in key joint angles over time. To deepen our study, we conducted a quantitative analysis using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT), resulting in two wavelet coefficients: the approximation coefficients (cA) and the detail coefficients (cD). RESULTS: Our analysis specifically focused on four crucial joint angles: \"the right hip,\" \"right knee,\" \"left hip,\" and \"left knee.\" Qualitative analysis revealed distinctions in the time-series data related to functional limitations and stiffness among patients with varying levels of KOA. In quantitative analysis, we observed variations in the cA among advanced KOA patients with different levels of physical function and joint stiffness. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in the cD between advanced KOA patients, demonstrating different levels of physical function and joint stiffness. It suggests that the primary difference in overall movement patterns lies in the varying degrees of joint stiffness and physical function among advanced KOA patients. DISCUSSION: Our method, designed to be low-cost and user-friendly, effectively captures spatiotemporal information distinctions among advanced KOA patients with varying stiffness levels and functional limitations utilizing smartphones.

       " Document(page_content=\"INTRODUCTION: HIV self-testing (HIVST) is highly sensitive and specific, addresses known barriers to HIV testing (such as stigma), and is recommended by the World Health Organization as a testing option for the delivery of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Nevertheless, HIVST remains underutilized as a diagnostic tool in community-based, differentiated HIV service delivery models, possibly due to concerns about result misinterpretation, which could lead to inadvertent onward transmission of HIV, delays in antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation, and incorrect initiation on PrEP. Ensuring that HIVST results are accurately interpreted for correct clinical decisions will be critical to maximizing HIVST's potential. Early evidence from a few small pilot studies suggests that artificial intelligence (AI) computer vision and machine learning could potentially assist with this task. As part of a broader study that task-shifted HIV testing to a new setting and cadre of healthcare provider (pharmaceutical technologists at private pharmacies) in Kenya, we sought to understand how well AI technology performed at interpreting HIVST results. METHODS: At 20 private pharmacies in Kisumu, Kenya, we offered free blood-based HIVST to clients >/=18 years purchasing products indicative of sexual activity (e.g., condoms). Trained pharmacy providers assisted clients with HIVST (as needed), photographed the completed HIVST, and uploaded the photo to a web-based platform. In real time, each self-test was interpreted independently by the (1) client and (2) pharmacy provider, with the HIVST images subsequently interpreted by (3) an AI algorithm (trained on lab-captured images of HIVST results) and (4) an expert panel of three HIVST readers. Using the expert panel's determination as the ground truth, we calculated the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) for HIVST result interpretation for the AI algorithm as well as for pharmacy clients and providers, for comparison. RESULTS: From March to June 2022, we screened 1,691 pharmacy clients and enrolled 1,500 in the study. All clients completed HIVST. Among 854 clients whose HIVST images were of sufficient quality to be interpretable by the AI algorithm, 63% (540/854) were female, median age was 26 years (interquartile range: 22-31), and 39% (335/855) reported casual sexual partners. The expert panel identified 94.9% (808/854) of HIVST images as HIV-negative, 5.1% (44/854) as HIV-positive, and 0.2% (2/854) as indeterminant. The AI algorithm demonstrated perfect sensitivity (100%), perfect NPV (100%), and 98.8% specificity, and 81.5% PPV (81.5%) due to seven false-positive results. By comparison, pharmacy clients and providers demonstrated lower sensitivity (93.2% and 97.7% respectively) and NPV (99.6% and 99.9% respectively) but perfect specificity (100%) and perfect PPV (100%). CONCLUSIONS: AI computer vision technology shows promise as a tool for providing additional quality assurance of HIV testing, particularly for catching Type II error (false-negative test interpretations) committed by human end-users. We discuss possible use cases for this technology to support differentiated HIV service delivery and identify areas for future research that is needed to assess the potential impacts-both positive and negative-of deploying this technology in real-world HIV service delivery settings.\", metadata={'PMID': '38384878', 'TI': 'Measuring the performance of computer vision artificial intelligence to interpret images of HIV self-testing results.', 'FAU': 'Roche, Stephanie D Ekwunife, Obinna I Mendonca, Rouella Kwach, Benn Omollo, Victor Zhang, Shengruo Ongwen, Patricia Hattery, David Smedinghoff, Sam Morris, Sarah Were, Daniel Rech, Dino Bukusi, Elizabeth A Ortblad, Katrina F', 'AU': 'Roche SD Ekwunife OI Mendonca R Kwach B Omollo V Zhang S Ongwen P Hattery D Smedinghoff S Morris S Were D Rech D Bukusi EA Ortblad KF', 'DP': NaT, 'MH': 'Humans Female Adult Male *HIV Self-Testing Artificial Intelligence *HIV Infections/diagnosis/prevention & control HIV Testing Computers', 'OT': 'HIV prevention HIV self-testing Kenya artificial intelligence differentiated service delivery mHealth pharmacy sub-Saharan Africa', 'PL': 'Switzerland', 'JT': 'Frontiers in public health', 'PMC': 'PMC10880864', 'EDAT': NaT, 'MHDA': NaT, 'STAT': 'MEDLINE'}),\n",

Lung cancer remains a significant global health challenge, contributing substantially to cancer-related mortality. Accurate assessment of Ki-67, a marker reflecting cellular proliferation, is crucial for evaluating tumor aggressiveness and treatment responsiveness, particularly in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis conducted following the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy studies (PRISMA-DTA) guidelines. Two authors independently conducted a literature search until September 23, 2023, in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science. The focus was on identifying radiomics studies that predict Ki-67 expression in lung cancer. We evaluated quality using both Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) and the Radiomics Quality Score (RQS) tools. For statistical analysis in the meta-analysis, we used STATA 14.2 to assess sensitivity, specificity, heterogeneity, and diagnostic values. RESULTS: Ten retrospective studies were pooled in the meta-analysis. The findings demonstrated that the use of computed tomography (CT) scan-based radiomics for predicting Ki-67 expression in lung cancer exhibited encouraging diagnostic performance. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) in training cohorts were 0.78, 0.81, and 0.85, respectively. In validation cohorts, these values were 0.78, 0.70, and 0.81. Quality assessment using QUADAS-2 and RQS indicated generally acceptable study quality. Heterogeneity in training cohorts, attributed to factors like contrast-enhanced CT scans and specific Ki-67 thresholds, was observed. Notably, publication bias was detected in the training cohort, indicating that positive results are more likely to be published than non-significant or negative results. Thus, journals are encouraged to publish negative results as well. CONCLUSION: In summary, CT-based radiomics exhibit promise in predicting Ki-67 expression in lung cancer. While the results suggest potential clinical utility, additional research efforts should concentrate on enhancing diagnostic accuracy.

For the proper diagnosis of blood diseases related to red blood cells, red blood cells must be accurately identified and categorized. Manual analysis is time-consuming and prone to mistakes. Analyzing multi-label samples, which contain clusters of cells, is challenging due to difficulties in separating individual cells, such as touching or overlapping cells. High-performance biomedical imaging and several medical applications are made possible by advanced biosensors. We develop an intelligent neural network model that can automatically identify and categorize red blood cells from microscopic medical images using region-based convolutional neural networks (RCNN) and cutting-edge biosensors. Our model successfully navigates obstacles like touching or overlapping cells and accurately recognizes various blood structures. Additionally, we utilized data augmentation as a pre-processing method on microscopic images to enhance the model's computational efficiency and expand the sample size. To refine the data and eliminate noise from the dataset, we utilized the Radial Gradient Index filtering algorithm for imaging data equalization. We exhibit improved detection accuracy and a reduced model loss rate when using medical imagery datasets to apply our proposed model in comparison to existing ResNet and GoogleNet models. Our model precisely detected red blood cells in a collection of medical images with 99% training accuracy and 91.21% testing accuracy.

Improving AI's sensitivity finds more high-risk patients but may raise medical costs while increasing specificity reduces unnecessary referrals but may weaken detection capability. To evaluate the trade-off between AI model performance and the long-running cost-effectiveness, we conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis in a nationwide diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening program in China, comprising 251,535 participants with diabetes over 30 years. We tested a validated AI model in 1100 different diagnostic performances (presented as sensitivity/specificity pairs) and modeled annual screening scenarios. The status quo was defined as the scenario with the most accurate AI performance. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated for other scenarios against the status quo as cost-effectiveness metrics. Compared to the status quo (sensitivity/specificity: 93.3%/87.7%), six scenarios were cost-saving and seven were cost-effective. To achieve cost-saving or cost-effective, the AI model should reach a minimum sensitivity of 88.2% and specificity of 80.4%. The most cost-effective AI model exhibited higher sensitivity (96.3%) and lower specificity (80.4%) than the status quo.

       " Document(page_content='The search for understanding immunotherapy response has sparked interest in diverse areas of oncology, with artificial intelligence (AI) and radiomics emerging as promising tools, capable of gathering large amounts of information to identify suitable patients for treatment. The application of AI in radiology has grown, driven by the hypothesis that radiology images capture tumor phenotypes and thus could provide valuable insights into immunotherapy response likelihood. However, despite the rapid growth of studies, no algorithms in the field have reached clinical implementation, mainly due to the lack of standardized methods, hampering study comparisons and reproducibility across different datasets. In this review, we performed a comprehensive assessment of published data to identify sources of variability in radiomics study design that hinder the comparison of the different model performance and, therefore, clinical implementation. Subsequently, we conducted a use-case meta-analysis using homogenous studies to assess the overall performance of radiomics in estimating programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression. Our findings indicate that, despite numerous attempts to predict immunotherapy response, only a limited number of studies share comparable methodologies and report sufficient data about cohorts and methods to be suitable for meta-analysis. Nevertheless, although only a few studies meet these criteria, their promising results underscore the importance of ongoing standardization and benchmarking efforts.

Expression profiles from 88 OS cases and 396 normal samples were procured from accessible public databases. Prognostic models were established using univariate COX regression analysis and an array of AI methodologies including the XGB method, RF method, GLM method, SVM method, and LASSO regression analysis. Multivariate COX regression analysis was also employed. Immune cell variations in OS were examined using the CIBERSORT software, and a differential analysis was conducted. Routine blood data from 20,679 normal samples and 437 OS cases were analyzed to validate lymphocyte disparity. Histological assessments of the study's postulates were performed through immunohistochemistry and hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. AI facilitated the identification of differentially expressed genes, which were utilized to construct a prognostic model. This model discerned that the survival rate in the high-risk category was significantly inferior compared to the low-risk cohort (p < 0.05). SERPINE2 was found to be positively associated with memory B cells, while CPT1B correlated positively with CD8 T cells. Immunohistochemical assessments indicated that SERPINE2 was more prominently expressed in OS tissues relative to adjacent non-tumorous tissues. Conversely, CPT1B expression was elevated in the adjacent non-tumorous tissues compared to OS tissues. Lymphocyte counts from routine blood evaluations exhibited marked differences between normal and OS groups (p < 0.001).

Therefore, it is necessary to actively control the tokamak based on the observed plasma state, to manoeuvre high-pressure plasma while avoiding tearing instability, the leading cause of disruptions. This presents an obstacle-avoidance problem for which artificial intelligence based on reinforcement learning has recently shown remarkable performance(1-4). However, the obstacle here, the tearing instability, is difficult to forecast and is highly prone to terminating plasma operations, especially in the ITER baseline scenario. Previously, we developed a multimodal dynamic model that estimates the likelihood of future tearing instability based on signals from multiple diagnostics and actuators(5). Here we harness this dynamic model as a training environment for reinforcement-learning artificial intelligence, facilitating automated instability prevention. We demonstrate artificial intelligence control to lower the possibility of disruptive tearing instabilities in DIII-D(6), the largest magnetic fusion facility in the United States. The controller maintained the tearing likelihood under a given threshold, even under relatively unfavourable conditions of low safety factor and low torque. In particular, it allowed the plasma to actively track the stable path within the time-varying operational space while maintaining H-mode performance, which was challenging with traditional preprogrammed control.

It increases realism and medical progress and avoids isolated systems and the difficulty of data exchange, analysis, and interpretation. Third, criteria for diagnosis are often heterogeneous and changeable. It includes symptoms, patient history, demographic, treatment, genetics, biochemistry, and imaging. Symptoms represent a high-impact indicator for early detection. It is important that we deal with these symptoms differently, which have a great relationship with semantics, vary widely, and have linguistic information. This negatively affects early diagnosis decision-making. Depending on the circumstances, the diagnosis is made solo on imaging and some medical tests.

Although implementation science has contributed much toward bridging this gap, the evidence-to-practice chasm remains a challenge. There are some key aspects of implementation science in which advances are needed, including speed and assessing causality and mechanisms. The increasing availability of artificial intelligence applications offers opportunities to help address specific issues faced by the field of implementation science and expand its methods. MAIN TEXT: This paper discusses the many ways artificial intelligence can address key challenges in applying implementation science methods while also considering potential pitfalls to the use of artificial intelligence. We answer the questions of \"why\" the field of implementation science should consider artificial intelligence, for \"what\" (the purpose and methods), and the \"what\" (consequences and challenges). We describe specific ways artificial intelligence can address implementation science challenges related to (1) speed, (2) sustainability, (3) equity, (4) generalizability, (5) assessing context and context-outcome relationships, and (6) assessing causality and mechanisms. Examples are provided from global health systems, public health, and precision health that illustrate both potential advantages and hazards of integrating artificial intelligence applications into implementation science methods. We conclude by providing recommendations and resources for implementation researchers and practitioners to leverage artificial intelligence in their work responsibly. CONCLUSIONS: Artificial intelligence holds promise to advance implementation science methods (\"why\") and accelerate its goals of closing the evidence-to-practice gap (\"purpose\"). However, evaluation of artificial intelligence\\'s potential unintended consequences must be considered and proactively monitored.

OBJECTIVE: To characterize the spatial interplay and prognostic role of different immune cell subpopulations in bladder cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2463 urothelial bladder carcinomas were immunostained with 21 antibodies using BLEACH&STAIN multiplex fluorescence immunohistochemistry in a tissue microarray format and analyzed using a framework of neuronal networks for an image analysis. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Spatial immune parameters were compared with histopathological parameters and overall survival data. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The identification of > 300 different immune cell subpopulations and the characterization of their spatial relationship resulted in numerous spatial interaction patterns. Thirty-nine immune parameters showed prognostic significance in univariate analyses, of which 16 were independent from pT, pN, and histological grade in muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Among all these parameters, the strongest association with prolonged overall survival was identified for intraepithelial CD8(+) cytotoxic T cells (time-dependent area under receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]: 0.70), while stromal CD8(+) T cells were less relevant (AUC: 0.65). A favorable prognosis of inflamed cancers with high levels of \"exhaustion markers\" suggests that TIM3, PD-L1, PD-1, and CTLA-4 on immune cells do not hinder antitumoral immune response in tumors rich of tumor infiltrating immune cells. CONCLUSIONS: The density of intraepithelial CD8(+) T cells was the strongest prognostic feature in muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Given that tumor cell killing by CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes through direct cell-to-cell-contacts represents the \"terminal end route\" of antitumor immunity, the quantity of \"tumor cell adjacent CD8(+) T cells\" may constitute a surrogate for the efficiency of cancer recognition by the immune system that can be measured straightaway in routine pathology as the CD8 labeling index.

Artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots based on large language models can structure free-text EMR data. We compare data extraction quality between ChatGPT-4 and human data collectors. METHODS: To train AI models to grade pediatric appendicitis preoperatively, several data collectors extracted detailed preoperative and operative data from 2100 children operated for acute appendicitis. Collectors were trained for the task based on satisfactory Kappa scores. ChatGPT-4 was prompted to structure free text from 103 random anonymized ultrasound and operative records in the dataset using the set variables and coding options, and to estimate appendicitis severity grade from the operative report. A pediatric surgeon then adjudicated all data, identifying errors in each method. RESULTS: Within the 44 ultrasound (42.7%) and 32 operative reports (31.1%) discordant in at least one field, 98% of the errors were found in the manual data extraction.

Given a detailed, user-defined knowledge schema and an input text, SPIRES recursively performs prompt interrogation against an LLM to obtain a set of responses matching the provided schema. SPIRES uses existing ontologies and vocabularies to provide identifiers for matched elements. We present examples of applying SPIRES in different domains, including extraction of food recipes, multi-species cellular signaling pathways, disease treatments, multi-step drug mechanisms, and chemical to disease relationships.

Although marijuana use has been associated with poorer cognitive performance, particularly in adolescents, its influence on the glymphatic system remains unexplored. This study evaluated the influence of the age of first marijuana use and the total number of lifetime uses on the glymphatic system, measured using the index of diffusion tensor imaging along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS). Furthermore, we explored the correlation between glymphatic clearance and cognitive performance among marijuana users.MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, 125 individuals who reported using marijuana at least once in their lifetime (43 men; mean age, 28.60 +/- 3.84 years) and 125 individuals with zero lifetime cannabis use (nonusers; 44 men; mean age, 28.82 +/- 3.56 years) were assessed. ALPS indices of all study participants were calculated using 3T diffusion MRI data (b = 1,000 s/mm2).RESULTS: After adjusting for age, sex, education years, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, alcohol use, tobacco use, and intracranial volume, our analysis using a univariate general linear model revealed no significant difference in the ALPS index among nonusers and marijuana users with different ages of first use or various frequencies of lifetime usage. However, in marijuana users, multiple linear regression analyses showed associations between a lower ALPS index and earlier age of first marijuana use (standardized beta, -0.20; P = 0.041), lower accuracy in the working memory 0-back task (standardized beta, 0.20; P = 0.042), and fewer correct responses in the fluid intelligence test (standardized beta, 0.19; P = 0.045).CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the potential use of DTI-ALPS as a noninvasive indirect indicator of the glymphatic clearance in young adults. Our findings show novel adverse effects of younger age at first use of marijuana on glymphatic system function, which is associated with impaired working memory and fluid intelligence.

METHODS: We extracted data on alerts generated from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2020, at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. We developed machine learning models to predict user responses to alerts. We applied XAI techniques to generate global explanations and local explanations. We evaluated the generated suggestions by comparing with alert's historical change logs and stakeholder interviews. Suggestions that either matched (or partially matched) changes already made to the alert or were considered clinically correct were classified as helpful. RESULTS: The final dataset included 2 991 823 firings with 2689 features. Among the 5 machine learning models, the LightGBM model achieved the highest Area under the ROC Curve: 0.919 [0.918, 0.920]. We identified 96 helpful suggestions. A total of 278 807 firings (9.3%) could have been eliminated. Some of the suggestions also revealed workflow and education issues. CONCLUSION: We developed a data-driven process to generate suggestions for improving alert criteria using XAI techniques. Our approach could identify improvements regarding clinical decision support (CDS) that might be overlooked or delayed in manual reviews. It also unveils a secondary purpose for the XAI: to improve quality by discovering scenarios where CDS alerts are not accepted due to workflow, education, or staffing issues.\", metadata={'PMID': '38383050', 'TI': 'Leveraging explainable artificial intelligence to optimize clinical decision support.', 'FAU': 'Liu, Siru McCoy, Allison B Peterson, Josh F Lasko, Thomas A Sittig, Dean F Nelson, Scott D Andrews, Jennifer Patterson, Lorraine Cobb, Cheryl M Mulherin, David Morton, Colleen T Wright, Adam', 'AU': 'Liu S McCoy AB Peterson JF Lasko TA Sittig DF Nelson SD Andrews J Patterson L Cobb CM Mulherin D Morton CT Wright A', 'DP': Timestamp('2024-02-22 00:00:00'), 'MH': 'None', 'OT': 'clinical decision support electronic health record explainable artificial intelligence', 'PL': 'England', 'JT': 'Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA', 'PMC': 'None', 'EDAT': NaT, 'MHDA': NaT, 'STAT': 'Publisher'}),\n",

Herein, we focus on optimizing the photocatalytic degradation of 2,6-DCP using artificial intelligence modeling, aiming at minimizing initial capital outlay and ongoing operational expenses. Hence, Fe/Zn@biochar, a novel material, was synthesized, characterized, and applied to harness the dual capabilities of 2,6-DCP adsorption and degradation. Fe/Zn@biochar exhibited an adsorption energy of -21.858 kJ/mol, effectively capturing the 2,6-DCP molecules. This catalyst accumulated photo-excited electrons, which, upon interaction with adsorbed oxygen and/or dissolved oxygen generated (*)O(2)(-). The (*)OH radicals could also be produced from h(+) in the Fe/Zn@biochar valence band, cleaving the C-Cl bonds to Cl(-) ions, dechlorinated byproducts, and phenols. An artificial neural network (ANN) model, with a 4-10-1 topology, \"trainlm\" training function, and feed-forward back-propagation algorithm, was developed to predict the 2,6-DCP removal efficiency. The ANN prediction accuracy was expressed as R(2) = 0.967 and mean squared error = 5.56e-22. The ANN-based optimized condition depicted that over 90% of 2,6-DCP could be eliminated under C(0) = 130 mg/L, pH = 2.74, and catalyst dosage = 168 mg/L within  approximately 4 h. This optimum condition corresponded to a total cost of $7.70/m(3), which was cheaper than the price estimated from the unoptimized photocatalytic system by 16%.

Since high-fidelity ab initio modeling techniques for computing the structure and properties can be prohibitively expensive, this motivates the development of machine-learning (ML) models that make these predictions more efficiently. Training graph neural networks over large atomistic databases introduces unique computational challenges, such as the need to process millions of small graphs with variable size and support communication patterns that are distinct from learning over large graphs, such as social networks. We demonstrate a novel hardware-software codesign approach to scale up the training of atomistic graph neural networks (GNN) for structure and property prediction. First, to eliminate redundant computation and memory associated with alternative padding techniques and to improve throughput via minimizing communication, we formulate the effective coalescing of the batches of variable-size atomistic graphs as the bin packing problem and introduce a hardware-agnostic algorithm to pack these batches. In addition, we propose hardware-specific optimizations, including a planner and vectorization for the gather-scatter operations targeted for Graphcore's Intelligence Processing Unit (IPU), as well as model-specific optimizations such as merged communication collectives and optimized softplus. Putting these all together, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed codesign approach by providing an implementation of a well-established atomistic GNN on the Graphcore IPUs. We evaluate the training performance on multiple atomistic graph databases with varying degrees of graph counts, sizes, and sparsity. We demonstrate that such a codesign approach can reduce the training time of atomistic GNNs and can improve their performance by up to 1.5x compared to the baseline implementation of the model on the IPUs. Additionally, we compare our IPU implementation with a Nvidia GPU-based implementation and show that our atomistic GNN implementation on the IPUs can run 1.8x faster on average compared to the execution time on the GPUs.\", metadata={'PMID': '38382011', 'TI': 'Acceleration of Graph Neural Network-Based Prediction Models in Chemistry via Co-Design Optimization on Intelligence Processing Units.', 'FAU': 'Helal, Hatem Firoz, Jesun Bilbrey, Jenna A Sprueill, Henry Herman, Kristina M Krell, Mario Michael Murray, Tom Roldan, Manuel Lopez Kraus, Mike Li, Ang Das, Payel Xantheas, Sotiris S Choudhury, Sutanay', 'AU': 'Helal H Firoz J Bilbrey JA Sprueill H Herman KM Krell MM Murray T Roldan ML Kraus M Li A Das P Xantheas SS Choudhury S', 'DP': Timestamp('2024-02-21 00:00:00'), 'MH': 'None', 'OT': 'None', 'PL': 'United States', 'JT': 'Journal of chemical information and modeling', 'PMC': 'None', 'EDAT': NaT, 'MHDA': NaT, 'STAT': 'Publisher'}),\n",

By investigating previously imprecise symptoms of pain, we sought to clarify distinct pain symptoms indicative of endometriosis, using an artificial intelligence-based approach. We used data from 473 women undergoing laparoscopy or laparotomy for a variety of surgical indications. Multiple anatomical pain locations were clustered based on the associations across samples to increase the power in the probability calculations. A Bayesian network was developed using pain-related features, subfertility, and diagnoses. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed by querying the network for the relative risk of a postoperative diagnosis, given the presence of different symptoms. Performance and sensitivity analyses demonstrated the advantages of Bayesian network analysis over traditional statistical techniques. Clustering grouped the 155 anatomical sites of pain into 15 pain locations. After pruning, the final Bayesian network included 18 nodes.

By using artificial intelligence (AI) to detect airway structures, the start and end points can be freely selected, thus eliminating the inconsistencies. Further deconstructing the process and establishing time-sequence analysis may aid in gaining further understanding of the TI process. METHODS: We developed a time-sequencing system for analyzing TI performed using a #3 Macintosh VLS. This system was established and validated on 30 easy TIs performed by specialists and validated using TI videos performed by a postgraduate-year (PGY) physician. Thirty easy intubation videos were selected from a cohort approved by our institutional review board (B-ER-107-088), and 6 targets were labeled: the lip, epiglottis, laryngopharynx, glottic opening, tube tip, and a black line on the endotracheal tube. We used 887 captured images to develop an AI model trained using You Only Look Once, Version 3 (YOLOv3). Seven cut points were selected for phase division. Seven experts selected the cut points. The expert cut points were used to validate the AI-identified cut points and time-sequence data. After the removal of the tube tip and laryngopharynx images, the durations between 5 identical cut points and sequentially identified the durations of 4 intubation phases, as well as TIT. RESULTS: The average and total losses approached 0 within 150 cycles of model training for target identification. The identification rate for all cut points was 92.4% (194 of 210), which increased to 99.4% (179 of 180) after the removal of the tube tip target. The 4 phase durations and TIT calculated by the AI model and those from the expert exhibited strong Pearson correlation (phase I, r = 0.914; phase II, r = 0.868; phase III, r = 0.964; and phase IV, r = 0.949; TIT, r = 0.99; all P < .001).

More accurate and automated developmental assessments are essential due to the lack of trained health care providers and imprecise parental reporting. In various areas of development, gross motor development in toddlers is known to be predictive of subsequent childhood developments. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to develop a model to assess gross motor behavior and integrate the results to determine the overall gross motor status of toddlers. This study also aimed to identify behaviors that are important in the assessment of overall gross motor skills and detect critical moments and important body parts for the assessment of each behavior. METHODS: We used behavioral videos of toddlers aged 18-35 months. To assess gross motor development, we selected 4 behaviors (climb up the stairs, go down the stairs, throw the ball, and stand on 1 foot) that have been validated with the Korean Developmental Screening Test for Infants and Children. In the child behavior videos, we estimated each child\\'s position as a bounding box and extracted human keypoints within the box. In the first stage, the videos with the extracted human keypoints of each behavior were evaluated separately using a graph convolutional networks (GCN)-based algorithm. The probability values obtained for each label in the first-stage model were used as input for the second-stage model, the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm, to predict the overall gross motor status. For interpretability, we used gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) to identify important moments and relevant body parts during the movements. The Shapley additive explanations method was used for the assessment of variable importance, to determine the movements that contributed the most to the overall developmental assessment. RESULTS: Behavioral videos of 4 gross motor skills were collected from 147 children, resulting in a total of 2395 videos.

       " Document(page_content=\"BACKGROUND: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing with their ability to generate human-like text through extensive training on large data sets. These models, including Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT)-3.5 (OpenAI), GPT-4 (OpenAI), and Bard (Google LLC), find applications beyond natural language processing, attracting interest from academia and industry. Students are actively leveraging LLMs to enhance learning experiences and prepare for high-stakes exams, such as the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) in India. OBJECTIVE: This comparative analysis aims to evaluate the performance of GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Bard in answering NEET-2023 questions. METHODS: In this paper, we evaluated the performance of the 3 mainstream LLMs, namely GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Google Bard, in answering questions related to the NEET-2023 exam. The questions of the NEET were provided to these artificial intelligence models, and the responses were recorded and compared against the correct answers from the official answer key. Consensus was used to evaluate the performance of all 3 models. RESULTS: It was evident that GPT-4 passed the entrance test with flying colors (300/700, 42.9%), showcasing exceptional performance. On the other hand, GPT-3.5 managed to meet the qualifying criteria, but with a substantially lower score (145/700, 20.7%). However, Bard (115/700, 16.4%) failed to meet the qualifying criteria and did not pass the test. GPT-4 demonstrated consistent superiority over Bard and GPT-3.5 in all 3 subjects. Specifically, GPT-4 achieved accuracy rates of 73% (29/40) in physics, 44% (16/36) in chemistry, and 51% (50/99) in biology. Conversely, GPT-3.5 attained an accuracy rate of 45% (18/40) in physics, 33% (13/26) in chemistry, and 34% (34/99) in biology. The accuracy consensus metric showed that the matching responses between GPT-4 and Bard, as well as GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, had higher incidences of being correct, at 0.56 and 0.57, respectively, compared to the matching responses between Bard and GPT-3.5, which stood at 0.42. When all 3 models were considered together, their matching responses reached the highest accuracy consensus of 0.59. CONCLUSIONS: The study's findings provide valuable insights into the performance of GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Bard in answering NEET-2023 questions. GPT-4 emerged as the most accurate model, highlighting its potential for educational applications. Cross-checking responses across models may result in confusion as the compared models (as duos or a trio) tend to agree on only a little over half of the correct responses. Using GPT-4 as one of the compared models will result in higher accuracy consensus. The results underscore the suitability of LLMs for high-stakes exams and their positive impact on education. Additionally, the study establishes a benchmark for evaluating and enhancing LLMs' performance in educational tasks, promoting responsible and informed use of these models in diverse learning environments.\", metadata={'PMID': '38381486', 'TI': 'Evaluating Large Language Models for the National Premedical Exam in India: Comparative Analysis of GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Bard.', 'FAU': 'Farhat, Faiza Chaudhry, Beenish Moalla Nadeem, Mohammad Sohail, Shahab Saquib Madsen, Dag Oivind', 'AU': 'Farhat F Chaudhry BM Nadeem M Sohail SS Madsen DO', 'DP': Timestamp('2024-02-21 00:00:00'), 'MH': 'Humans *Artificial Intelligence Educational Status *Benchmarking Confusion India', 'OT': 'AI model Bard ChatGPT GPT-4 Generative Pre-trained Transformers accuracy artificial intelligence educational task large language models medical education, medical exam natural language processing performance premedical exams suitability', 'PL': 'Canada', 'JT': 'JMIR medical education', 'PMC': 'None', 'EDAT': NaT, 'MHDA': NaT, 'STAT': 'MEDLINE'}),\n",

The association between retinal OCT biomarkers and cognitive performance has been demonstrated in several studies, and their importance in cognitive assessment is increasingly being recognized. Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) with an exponential number of applications in the medical field, particularly its deep learning (DL) subset, which is widely used for the analysis of medical images. These techniques efficiently deal with novel biomarkers when their outcome for the applications of interest is unclear, e.g., for diagnosis, prognosis prediction, disease staging, or any other relevance to clinical practice. However, using AI-based tools for medical purposes must be approached with caution, despite the many efforts to address the black-box nature of such approaches, especially due to the general underperformance in datasets other than those used for their development. Retinal OCT biomarkers are promising as potential indicators for decline in cognitive function. The underlying mechanisms are currently being explored to gain deeper insights into this relationship linking retinal health and cognitive function. Insights from neurovascular coupling and retinal microvascular changes play an important role.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop and evaluate an ML system\\'s utility for cardiopulmonary auscultation. METHODS: First, we developed an ML system for cardiopulmonary auscultation, using cardiopulmonary sound files from our previous study. The technique involved pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification through several neural network layers. After integration, the output class was categorized as \"normal,\" \"abnormal,\" or \"undetermined.\" Second, we evaluated the ML system with 24 junior residents in an open-label randomized controlled trial at a university hospital. Participants were randomly assigned to the ML system group (intervention) or conventional auscultation group (control). During training, participants listened to four cardiac and four pulmonary sounds, all of which were correctly classified. Then, participants classified a series of 16 simultaneous cardiopulmonary sounds. The control group auscultated the sounds using noise-cancelling headphones, while the intervention group did so by watching recommendations from the ML system. RESULTS: The total scores for correctly identified normal or abnormal cardiopulmonary sounds in the intervention group were significantly higher than those in the control group (366/384 [95.3%] vs. 343/384 [89.3%], P = 0.003).

Quantum mechanics (QM)-based crystal structure predictions (CSPs) have somewhat alleviated the dilemma that experimental crystal structure investigations struggle to conduct complete polymorphism studies, but the high computing cost poses a challenge to its widespread application. The present study aims to construct DeepCSP, a feasible pure machine learning framework for minute-scale rapid organic CSP. Initially, based on 177,746 data entries from the Cambridge Crystal Structure Database, a generative adversarial network was built to conditionally generate trial crystal structures under selected feature constraints for the given molecule. Simultaneously, a graph convolutional attention network was used to predict the density of stable crystal structures for the input molecule. Subsequently, the distances between the predicted density and the definition-based calculated density would be considered to be the crystal structure screening and ranking basis, and finally, the density-based crystal structure ranking would be output. Two such distinct algorithms, performing the generation and ranking functionalities, respectively, collectively constitute the DeepCSP, which has demonstrated compelling performance in marketed drug validations, achieving an accuracy rate exceeding 80% and a hit rate surpassing 85%.

The visual arts can increase emotional intelligence and critical thinking skills. This study, conducted at Georgetown University School of Medicine (GUSoM) and the National Gallery of Art (NGA) in Washington, DC, was designed to measure the effect of a visual arts elective course on medical students' self-perception of their communication skills. METHODS: This 6-week course involved lessons at the NGA and GUSoM for16 second-year medical students. The intervention students were age and gender-matched to14 second-year medical student control participants who took different elective courses. Prior to and following the intervention, the participants completed the Communication Skills Attitude Scale (CSAS). Statistical analysis was performed with either the 2-sided t-test or 2-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in the presurvey scores between the groups. However, there were 6 CSAS questions in the postsurveys that had statistically significant differences between the 2 groups. Within each group, there were also numerous statistically significant differences between their presurvey and postsurvey responses, with positive changes occurring in the intervention group (IG) and primarily negative changes occurring in the control group (CG). The NGA course improved the self-perception of communication skills, with students reporting stronger views on the importance of communication skills in teamwork and patient rapport. The CG, on the other hand, did not have as many improved perceptions of communication skills and had stronger opinions regarding not needing the ability to communicate well to be a good physician.

       " Document(page_content='PURPOSE: In recent years, the continuous advancement of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has led to the widespread integration of deep neural networks as a mainstream approach in clinical diagnostic support. Particularly, the utilization of CNN-based medical image segmentation has delivered favorable outcomes for aiding clinical diagnosis. Within this realm, network architectures based on the U-shaped structure and incorporating skip connections, along with their diverse derivatives, have gained extensive utilization across various medical image segmentation tasks. Nonetheless, two primary challenges persist. First, certain organs or tissues present considerable complexity, substantial morphological variations, and size discrepancies, posing significant challenges for achieving highly accurate segmentation. Second, the predominant focus of current deep neural networks on single-resolution feature extraction limits the effective extraction of feature information from complex medical images, thereby contributing to information loss via continuous pooling operations and contextual information interaction constraints within the U-shaped structure. APPROACH: We proposed a five-layer pyramid segmentation network (PS5-Net), a multiscale segmentation network with diverse resolutions that is founded on the U-Net architecture. Initially, this network effectively leverages the distinct features of images at varying resolutions across different dimensions, departing from prior single-resolution feature extraction methods to adapt to intricate and variable segmentation scenarios. Subsequently, to comprehensively integrate feature information from diverse resolutions, a kernel selection module is proposed to assign weights to features across different dimensions, enhancing the fusion of feature information from various resolutions. Within the feature extraction network denoted as PS-UNet, we preserve the classical structure of the traditional U-Net while enhancing it through the incorporation of dilated convolutions. RESULTS: PS5-Net attains a Dice score of 0.9613 for liver segmentation on the CHLISC dataset and 0.8587 on the ISIC2018 dataset for skin lesion segmentation. Comparative analysis with diverse medical image segmentation methodologies in recent years reveals that PS5-Net has achieved the highest scores and substantial advancements. CONCLUSIONS: PS5-Net effectively harnesses the rich semantic information available at different resolutions, facilitating a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the input medical images. By capitalizing on global contextual connections, the network adeptly captures the intricate interplay of features and dependencies across the entire image, resulting in more accurate and robust segmentation outcomes. The experimental validation of PS5-Net underscores its superior performance in medical image segmentation tasks, offering promising prospects for enhancing diagnostic and analytical processes within clinical settings. These results highlight the potential of PS5-Net to significantly contribute to the advancement of medical imaging technologies and ultimately improve patient care through more precise and reliable image analysis.', metadata={'PMID': '38379775', 'TI': 'PS5-Net: a medical image segmentation network with multiscale resolution.', 'FAU': 'Li, Fuchen Liu, Yong Qi, JianBo Du, Yansong Wang, QingYue Ma, WenBo Xu, XianChong Zhang, ZhongQi', 'AU': 'Li F Liu Y Qi J Du Y Wang Q Ma W Xu X Zhang Z', 'DP': NaT, 'MH': 'None', 'OT': 'artificial intelligence convolutional neural network deep learning multiscale feature fusion semantic segmentation', 'PL': 'United States', 'JT': 'Journal of medical imaging (Bellingham, Wash.)', 'PMC': 'PMC10876014', 'EDAT': NaT, 'MHDA': NaT, 'STAT': 'PubMed-not-MEDLINE'}),\n",

AI-enabled ECG (AI-ECG) acquired during normal sinus rhythm has been shown to identify individuals with AF by noting high-risk ECG features invisible to the human eye. We sought to characterize the value of AI-ECG in predicting AF development following PFO closure and investigate key clinical and procedural characteristics possibly associated with post-procedural AF. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients who underwent PFO closure at our hospital from January 2011 to December 2022. We recorded the probability (%) of AF using the Mayo Clinic AI-ECG dashboard from pre- and post-procedure ECGs. The cut-off point of >/= 11 %, which was found to optimally balance sensitivity and specificity in the original derivation paper (the Youden index) was used to label an AI-ECG \"positive\" for AF. Pre-procedural transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and pre- and post-procedure transcranial doppler (TCD) data was also recorded. RESULTS: Out of 93 patients, 49 (53 %) were male, mean age was 55 +/- 15 years with mean post-procedure follow up of 29 +/- 3 months. Indication for PFO closure in 69 (74 %) patients was for secondary prevention of transient ischemic attack (TIA) and/or stroke. Twenty patients (22 %) developed paroxysmal AF post-procedure, with the majority within the first month post-procedure (15 patients, 75 %). Patients who developed AF were not significantly more likely to have a positive post-procedure AI-ECG than those who did not develop AF (30 % AF vs 27 % no AF, p = 0.8).Based on the PFO-Associated Stroke Causal Likelihood (PASCAL) classification, patients who had PFO closure for secondary prevention of TIA and/or stroke in the \"possible\" group were significantly more likely to develop AF than patients in \"probable\" and \"unlikely\" groups (p = 0.034). AF-developing patients were more likely to have post-procedure implantable loop recorder (ILR) (55 % vs 9.6 %, p < 0.001), and longer duration of ILR monitoring (121 vs 92.5 weeks, p = 0.035). There were no significant differences in TCD and TEE characteristics, device type, or device size between those who developed AF vs those who did not. CONCLUSIONS: In this small, retrospective study, AI-ECG did not accurately distinguish patients who developed AF post-PFO closure from those who did not.

We automatically classified PLCs on routine-stained biopsies using a weakly supervised learning method. METHOD: We selected 166 PLC biopsies divided into training, internal and external validation sets: 90, 29 and 47 samples, respectively. Two liver pathologists reviewed each whole-slide hematein eosin saffron (HES)-stained image (WSI). After annotating the tumour/non-tumour areas, tiles of 256x256 pixels were extracted from the WSIs and used to train a ResNet18 neural network. The tumour/non-tumour annotations served as labels during training, and the network's last convolutional layer was used to extract new tumour tile features. Without knowledge of the precise labels of the malignancies, we then applied an unsupervised clustering algorithm. RESULTS: Pathological review classified the training and validation sets into hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC, 33/90, 11/29 and 26/47), intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA, 28/90, 9/29 and 15/47), and cHCC-CCA (29/90, 9/29 and 6/47). In the two-cluster model, Clusters 0 and 1 contained mainly HCC and iCCA histological features. The diagnostic agreement between the pathological diagnosis and the two-cluster model predictions (major contingent) in the internal and external validation sets was 100% (11/11) and 96% (25/26) for HCC and 78% (7/9) and 87% (13/15) for iCCA, respectively. For cHCC-CCA, we observed a highly variable proportion of tiles from each cluster (cluster 0: 5-97%; cluster 1: 2-94%). CONCLUSION: Our method applied to PLC HES biopsy could identify specific morphological features of HCC and iCCA.

However, most of these schemes do not consider the introduction of sparsity into the motion control of redundant manipulators, resulting in excessive joint movements, which not only consume extra energy but also increase the risk of unexpected collisions in complex environments.

METHODS: N = 164 treatment seeking patients with pSUD were sampled at treatment initiation. We examined associations between cognitive impairment according to Montreal Cognitive Assessment((R)) (MoCA((R))), Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI), and Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Function - Adult version (BRIEF-A) administered at treatment initiation and psychological distress defined by the Symptom Check List-90-Revised (SCL-90-R) at treatment initiation, one and five years later. We ran hierarchical logistic regressions to assess the predictive ability of the respective cognitive instruments administered at treatment initiation on psychological distress measured one and five years later including psychological distress at treatment initiation and substance intake at the time-points of the measurements as covariates. RESULTS: The main results was that MoCA((R)) and BRIEF-A predicted psychological distress at years one and five, but BRIEF-A lost predictive power when accounting for psychological distress at treatment initiation. WASI predicted psychological distress at year one, but not at year five.

PURPOSE: To assess the effect on time to diagnose cervical spine fractures on CT and diagnostic accuracy of a commercially available AI application. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study (June 2020 - March 2022) with historic controls and prospective evaluation, we evaluated regulatory-cleared AI-software to prioritize cervical spine fractures on CT. All patients underwent non-contrast CT of the cervical spine. The time between CT acquisition and the moment the scan was first opened (DNT) was compared between the retrospective and prospective cohorts. The reference standard for determining diagnostic accuracy was the radiology report created in routine clinical workflow and adjusted by a senior radiologist. Discrepant cases were reviewed and clinical relevance of missed fractures was determined. RESULTS: 2973 (mean age, 55.4 +/- 19.7 [standard deviation]; 1857 men) patients were analyzed by AI, including 2036 retrospective and 938 prospective cases. Overall prevalence of cervical spine fractures was 7.6 %. The DNT was 18 % (5 min) shorter in the prospective cohort. In scans positive for cervical spine fracture according to the reference standard, DNT was 46 % (16 min) shorter in the prospective cohort. Overall sensitivity of the AI application was 89.8 % (95 % CI: 84.2-94.0 %), specificity was 95.3 % (95 % CI: 94.2-96.2 %), and diagnostic accuracy was 94.8 % (95 % CI: 93.8-95.8 %).

Our aim was to determine diagnostic performance of X-rays radiomics-based machine learning for classification of ACT and high-grade CS of long bones. METHODS: This retrospective, IRB-approved study included 150 patients with surgically treated and histology-proven lesions at two tertiary bone sarcoma centres. At centre 1, the dataset was split into training (n = 71 ACT, n = 24 high-grade CS) and internal test (n = 19 ACT, n = 6 high-grade CS) cohorts, respectively, based on the date of surgery. At centre 2, the dataset constituted the external test cohort (n = 12 ACT, n = 18 high-grade CS). Manual segmentation was performed on frontal view X-rays, using MRI or CT for preliminary identification of lesion margins. After image pre-processing, radiomic features were extracted. Dimensionality reduction included stability, coefficient of variation, and mutual information analyses. In the training cohort, after class balancing, a machine learning classifier (Support Vector Machine) was automatically tuned using nested 10-fold cross-validation. Then, it was tested on both the test cohorts and compared to two musculoskeletal radiologists' performance using McNemar's test. FINDINGS: Five radiomic features (3 morphology, 2 texture) passed dimensionality reduction.

As a result, many AI investments have stalled at the prototype level, never reaching clinical settings. OBJECTIVE: To improve the chances of future AI implementation projects succeeding, we analyzed the experiences of clinical AI system implementers to better understand the challenges and success factors in their implementations. METHODS: Thirty-seven implementers of clinical AI from European and North and South American countries were interviewed. Semi-structured interviews were transcribed and analyzed qualitatively with the framework method, identifying the success factors and the reasons for challenges as well as documenting proposals from implementers to improve AI adoption in clinical settings. RESULTS: We gathered the implementers' requirements for facilitating AI adoption in the clinical setting. The main findings include 1) the lesser importance of AI explainability in favor of proper clinical validation studies, 2) the need to actively involve clinical practitioners, and not only clinical researchers, in the inception of AI research projects, 3) the need for better information structures and processes to manage data access and the ethical approval of AI projects, 4) the need for better support for regulatory compliance and avoidance of duplications in data management approval bodies, 5) the need to increase both clinicians' and citizens' literacy as respects the benefits and limitations of AI, and 6) the need for better funding schemes to support the implementation, embedding, and validation of AI in the clinical workflow, beyond pilots. CONCLUSION: Participants in the interviews are positive about the future of AI in clinical settings.

Medical imaging plays a critical role in facilitating patient diagnoses but involves multiple sources of bias including factors related to access to imaging modalities, acquisition of images, and assessment (ie, interpretation) of imaging data. Machine learning (ML) applied to diagnostic imaging has demonstrated the potential to improve the quality of imaging-based diagnosis and the precision of measuring imaging-based traits. Algorithms can leverage subtle information not visible to the human eye to detect underdiagnosed conditions or derive new disease phenotypes by linking imaging features with clinical outcomes, all while mitigating cognitive bias in interpretation. Importantly, however, the application of ML to diagnostic imaging has the potential to either reduce or propagate bias. Understanding the potential gain as well as the potential risks requires an understanding of how and what ML models learn. Common risks of propagating bias can arise from unbalanced training, suboptimal architecture design or selection, and uneven application of models. Notwithstanding these risks, ML may yet be applied to improve gain from imaging across all 3A's (access, acquisition, and assessment) for all patients.

While a plethora of web-based resources exist to teach programming skills and ML model development, there are few introductory curricula specifically tailored to medical students without a background in data science or programming. Programs that do exist are often restricted to a specific specialty. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that a 1-month elective for fourth-year medical students, composed of high-quality existing web-based resources and a project-based structure, would empower students to learn about the impact of AI and ML in their chosen specialty and begin contributing to innovation in their field of interest. This study aims to evaluate the success of this elective in improving self-reported confidence scores in AI and ML. The authors also share our curriculum with other educators who may be interested in its adoption. METHODS: This elective was offered in 2 tracks: technical (for students who were already competent programmers) and nontechnical (with no technical prerequisites, focusing on building a conceptual understanding of AI and ML). Students established a conceptual foundation of knowledge using curated web-based resources and relevant research papers, and were then tasked with completing 3 projects in their chosen specialty: a data set analysis, a literature review, and an AI project proposal. The project-based nature of the elective was designed to be self-guided and flexible to each student's interest area and career goals. Students' success was measured by self-reported confidence in AI and ML skills in pre and postsurveys. Qualitative feedback on students' experiences was also collected. RESULTS: This web-based, self-directed elective was offered on a pass-or-fail basis each month to fourth-year students at Emory University School of Medicine beginning in May 2021. As of June 2022, a total of 19 students had successfully completed the elective, representing a wide range of chosen specialties: diagnostic radiology (n=3), general surgery (n=1), internal medicine (n=5), neurology (n=2), obstetrics and gynecology (n=1), ophthalmology (n=1), orthopedic surgery (n=1), otolaryngology (n=2), pathology (n=2), and pediatrics (n=1). Students' self-reported confidence scores for AI and ML rose by 66% after this 1-month elective.

       " Document(page_content=\"BACKGROUND: Identification of patients with high risk of experiencing inability to walk after surgery is important for surgeons to make therapeutic strategies for patients with metastatic spinal disease. However, there is a lack of clinical tool to assess postoperative ambulatory status for those patients. The emergence of artificial intelligence brings a promising opportunity to develop accurate prediction models. METHODS: This study collected 455 patients with metastatic spinal disease who underwent posterior decompressive surgery at three tertiary medical institutions. Of these, 220 patients were collected from one medical institution to form the model derivation cohort, while 89 and 146 patients were collected from two other medical institutions to form the external validation cohorts 1 and 2, respectively. Patients in the model derivation cohort were used to develop and internally validate models. To establish the interactive AI platform, machine learning techniques were used to develop prediction models, including logistic regression (LR), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting machine (eXGBM), support vector machine (SVM), and neural network (NN). Furthermore, to enhance the resilience of the study's model, an ensemble machine learning approach was employed using a soft-voting method by combining the results of the above six algorithms. A scoring system incorporating 10 evaluation metrics was used to comprehensively assess the prediction performance of the developed models. The scoring system had a total score of 0 to 60, with higher scores denoting better prediction performance. An interactive AI platform was further deployed via Streamlit. The prediction performance was compared between medical experts and the AI platform in assessing the risk of experiencing postoperative inability to walk among patients with metastatic spinal disease. RESULTS: Among all developed models, the ensemble model outperformed the six other models with the highest score of 57, followed by the eXGBM model (54), SVM model (50), and NN model (50). The ensemble model had the best performance in accuracy and calibration slope, and the second-best performance in precise, recall, specificity, area under the curve (AUC), Brier score, and log loss. The scores of the LR model, RF model, and DT model were 39, 46, and 26, respectively. External validation demonstrated that the ensemble model had an AUC value of 0.873 (95%CI: 0.809-0.936) in the external validation cohort 1 and 0.924 (95%CI: 0.890-0.959) in the external validation cohort 2. In the new ensemble machine learning model excluding the feature of the number of comorbidities, the AUC value was still as high as 0.916 (95% CI: 0.863-0.969). In addition, the AUC values of the new model were 0.880 (95% CI: 0.819-0.940) in the external validation cohort 1 and 0.922 (95% CI: 0.887-0.958) in the external validation cohort 2, indicating favorable generalization of the model. The interactive AI platform was further deployed online based on the final machine learning model, and it was available at https://postoperativeambulatory-izpdr6gsxxwhitr8fubutd.streamlit.app/. By using the AI platform, researchers were able to obtain the individual predicted risk of postoperative inability to walk, gain insights into the key factors influencing the outcome, and find the stratified therapeutic recommendations. The AUC value obtained from the AI platform was significantly higher than the average AUC value achieved by the medical experts (P<0.001), denoting that the AI platform obviously outperformed the individual medical experts. CONCLUSIONS: The study successfully develops and validates an interactive AI platform for evaluating the risk of postoperative loss of ambulatory ability in patients with metastatic spinal disease. This AI platform has the potential to serve as a valuable model for guiding healthcare professionals in implementing surgical plans and ultimately enhancing patient outcomes.\", metadata={'PMID': '38376838', 'TI': 'Establishment and validation of an interactive artificial intelligence platform to predict postoperative ambulatory status for patients with metastatic spinal disease: a multicenter analysis.', 'FAU': 'Cui, Yunpeng Shi, Xuedong Qin, Yong Wan, Qiwei Cao, Xuyong Che, Xiaotong Pan, Yuanxing Wang, Bing Lei, Mingxing Liu, Yaosheng', 'AU': 'Cui Y Shi X Qin Y Wan Q Cao X Che X Pan Y Wang B Lei M Liu Y', 'DP': Timestamp('2024-02-19 00:00:00'), 'MH': 'None', 'OT': 'None', 'PL': 'United States', 'JT': 'International journal of surgery (London, England)', 'PMC': 'None', 'EDAT': NaT, 'MHDA': NaT, 'STAT': 'Publisher'}),\n",

Presently, assessments predominantly rely on static stimuli and self-reported measures, which may not capture the dynamic dimensions of social cognition. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to validate the Chinese version of Movie Assessment of Social Cognition (MASC-CH) and to investigate whether MDD and BD exhibit distinct patterns of SC impairments, shedding light on potential differences between these two mood disorders. METHODS: The study encompassed 197 participants, aged 18-65, distributed as follows: 21 BD, 20 MDD, and 156 healthy controls (HC). We focused on examining \"cognitive\" and \"emotional\" SC scores and \"undermentalizing\" and \"overmentalizing\" error patterns, with nonsocial inference as a control. Additional assessments included the Reading Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) and the Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT). We also explored the association between depression severity (measured by the Hamilton Depressive Rating Scale, HDRS) and distinct SC dimensions between MDD and BD. RESULTS: The MASC-CH exhibited strong validity and reliability for SC assessment. In group comparisons, BD participants scored significantly lower on MASC-CH, while the MDD group scores were not significantly different from HC. Specifically, BD individuals had notably lower cognitive SC scores and made more undermentalizing and absence of mentalizing errors than MDD and HC. Additionally, a negative correlation between HDRS score and overmentalizing was observed in BD, not in the MDD. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that depression severity scores in BD were inversely related to MASC-CH scores. In contrast, this relationship was not observed in the MDD group.

       " Document(page_content='PURPOSE: To determine how radiology, nuclear medicine, and medical imaging journals encourage and mandate the use of reporting guidelines for artificial intelligence (AI) in their author and reviewer instructions. METHODS: The primary source of journal information and associated citation data used was the Journal Citation Reports (June 2023 release for 2022 citation data; Clarivate Analytics, UK). The first- and second-quartile journals indexed in the Science Citation Index Expanded and the Emerging Sources Citation Index were included. The author and reviewer instructions were evaluated by two independent readers, followed by an additional reader for consensus, with the assistance of automatic annotation. Encouragement and submission requirements were systematically analyzed. The reporting guidelines were grouped as AI-specific, related to modeling, and unrelated to modeling. RESULTS: Out of 102 journals, 98 were included in this study, and all of them had author instructions. Only five journals (5%) encouraged the authors to follow AI-specific reporting guidelines. Among these, three required a filled-out checklist. Reviewer instructions were found in 16 journals (16%), among which one journal (6%) encouraged the reviewers to follow AI-specific reporting guidelines without submission requirements. The proportions of author and reviewer encouragement for AI-specific reporting guidelines were statistically significantly lower compared with those for other types of guidelines (P < 0.05 for all). CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that AI-specific guidelines are not commonly encouraged and mandated (i.e., requiring a filled-out checklist) by these journals, compared with guidelines related to modeling and unrelated to modeling, leaving vast space for improvement.

PURPOSE: To describe the development and implementation of clinical dashboards to standardize data capturing and reporting across multiple partner health systems. SUMMARY: Between July and September 2020, clinical dashboards were developed and implemented across multiple partner health-system specialty pharmacies (HSSPs) located throughout the United States. The dashboards were developed via collaboration between personnel involved in clinical subcommittees, clinical outcomes, data analytics, information technology, and clinical and central operations. Utilizing a cloud-scale business intelligence service, patient clinical data documented in a shared patient management system was utilized to create customizable dashboards that displayed patient-reported outcome measures, collected laboratory or test results, and completed pharmacist interventions. Separate dashboards were developed for several disease states and/or medication classes. Based on specialty pharmacy recommendations, medical literature, and clinical guidelines, internally developed disease-specific protocols defined data included in the dashboards and ensured consistent data collection amongst partner health systems. Having access to real-time clinical information allows health systems to closely monitor performance metrics, track patient outcomes, and identify operational gaps. CONCLUSION: Accurately capturing and reporting clinical metrics using clinical dashboards can assist HSSPs in delivering high-quality care. Having access to clinical outcome measures allows HSSPs to better understand the impact of their services on patients' health and quality of life. Health systems can utilize this data to analyze trends and recognize areas of opportunity so that measures can be taken to improve patient care.\", metadata={'PMID': '38375599', 'TI': 'Clinical dashboard development and implementation to standardize data capture and reporting across health-system specialty pharmacies.', 'FAU': 'Fitzpatrick, Casey Kantoris, Carson Giavatto, Carly Medina, Ana Lopez Mourani, Jessica Hardin, Brandon Torres, Hector Mayol Skrtic, Amber Rosa, Erica', 'AU': 'Fitzpatrick C Kantoris C Giavatto C Medina AL Mourani J Hardin B Torres HM Skrtic A Rosa E', 'DP': Timestamp('2024-02-20 00:00:00'), 'MH': 'None', 'OT': 'clinical outcome measures (COMs) dashboard disease-specific protocols health-system specialty pharmacy (HSSP) subcommittees', 'PL': 'England', 'JT': 'American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists', 'PMC': 'None', 'EDAT': NaT, 'MHDA': NaT, 'STAT': 'Publisher'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"The global surge in energy demand, driven by technological advances and population growth, underscores the critical need for effective management of electricity supply and demand. In certain developing nations, a significant challenge arises because the energy demand of their population exceeds their capacity to generate, as is the case in Iraq. This study focuses on energy forecasting in Iraq, using a previously unstudied dataset from 2019 to 2021, sourced from the Iraqi Ministry of Electricity. The study employs a diverse set of advanced forecasting models, including Linear Regression, XGBoost, Random Forest, Long Short-Term Memory, Temporal Convolutional Networks, and Multi-Layer Perceptron, evaluating their performance across four distinct forecast horizons (24, 48, 72, and 168 hours ahead). Key findings reveal that Linear Regression is a consistent top performer in demand forecasting, while XGBoost excels in supply forecasting. Statistical analysis detects differences in models performances for both datasets, although no significant differences are found in pairwise comparisons for the supply dataset. This study emphasizes the importance of accurate energy forecasting for energy security, resource allocation, and policy-making in Iraq. It provides tools for decision-makers to address energy challenges, mitigate power shortages, and stimulate economic growth. It also encourages innovative forecasting methods, the use of external variables like weather and economic data, and region-specific models tailored to Iraq's energy landscape.

       " Document(page_content=\"INTRODUCTION: Assistive technology is increasingly used to support the physical needs of differently abled persons but has yet to make inroads on support for cognitive or psychological issues. This gap is an opportunity to address another-the lack of contribution from theoretical social science that can provide insights into problems that cannot be seen. Using Affect Control Theory (ACT), the current project seeks to close that gap with an artificially intelligent application to improve interaction and affect for people with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). Using sociological theory, it models interactions with persons with ADRD based on self-sentiments, rather than cognitive memory, and informs a cellphone-based assistive tool called VIPCare for supporting caregivers. METHODS: Staff focus groups and interviews with family members of persons with ADRD in a long-term residential care facility collected residents' daily needs and personal histories. Using ACT's evaluation, potency, and activity dimensions, researchers used these data to formulate a self-sentiment profile for each resident and programmed that profile into the VIPCare application. VIPCare used that profile to simulate affectively intelligent social interactions with each unique resident that reduce deflection from established sentiments and, thus, negative emotions. RESULTS: We report on the data collection to design the application, develop self-sentiment profiles for the resident, and generate assistive technology that applies a sociological theory of affect to real world management of interaction, emotion, and mental health. DISCUSSION: By reducing trial and error in learning to engage people with dementia, this tool has potential to smooth interaction and improve wellbeing for a population vulnerable to distress.\", metadata={'PMID': '38375150', 'TI': 'Preserving the self with artificial intelligence using VIPCare-a virtual interaction program for dementia caregivers.', 'FAU': 'Francis, Linda Ghafurian, Moojan', 'AU': 'Francis L Ghafurian M', 'DP': NaT, 'MH': 'None', 'OT': 'affect control theory artificial intelligence caregiving dementia-Alzheimer disease emotion self supportive technology', 'PL': 'Switzerland', 'JT': 'Frontiers in sociology', 'PMC': 'PMC10875992', 'EDAT': NaT, 'MHDA': NaT, 'STAT': 'PubMed-not-MEDLINE'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Optical spectroscopy is studied to contribute to skin cancer diagnosis. Indeed, optical spectra are modified along cancer progression and provide complementary information (e.g., on metabolism and tissue structure) to clinical examination for surgical guidance [1,2]. The current original dataset is made of autofluorescence and diffuse reflectance spectra acquired in vivo on 131 patients\\' skin with the SpectroLive device [3,4]. Spatially-resolved spectroscopy measurements were performed using a multi-fiber optic probe featuring 4 distances (0.4-1 mm) between excitation and collection optical fibers: spatial resolution allows spectra acquired at different distances to carry information from different depths in skin tissues. Five types of autofluorescence spectra were acquired using five different wavelength excitations (on the 365-415 nm spectral range) in order to collect information on several skin endogenous fluorophores (e.g., flavins, collagen). A sixth light source (white broadband) was used to acquire diffuse reflectance spectra carrying information about skin scattering properties and skin endogenous absorbers such as melanin and hemoglobin. Patients were proposed to be included into the clinical trial if they were suspected of suffering from actinic keratoses (precancerous skin lesions) or from basal or squamous cell carcinomas: in all cases, complete diagnostics is provided in the dataset. To increase the interest of the dataset and evaluate the dependence of optical spectra (intensity, shape) not only on pathological states but also on healthy skin features (civil age, skin age, gender, phototype, anatomical site), spectra were acquired for all 131 patients on two so-called \"reference\" skin sites known to rarely suffer from skin cancer: palm of the hand (featuring a thick skin type) and inner wrist (featuring thin skin). Spectra are available in .tab files: first column displays the spectral range on which intensity spectra were recorded (317-788 nm) and each following column provides an intensity spectrum acquired by each spectrometer for a given combination of light source excitation and distance. Each of the 131 folders corresponding to each of the 131 patients contains a .json file providing patients clinical features: gender, civil age, skin age, phototype score and class. All .tab files names include anatomical site and anatomopathological diagnostics of the skin site on which spectra were acquired: codes were defined to match a letter or an acronym to each diagnostic and anatomical site. To ensure quality control, a spectrum was acquired on the same calibration standard before starting spectra acquisition on each patient. It is therefore possible to follow the impact of the acquisition optical chain ageing during the 4.5 years that the patients were included. This dataset can be used by epidemiologists for the characterization of populations affected by skin cancers (gender ratio, mean age, anatomical sites typically affected, etc.); it may also be used by researchers in artificial intelligence to develop innovative methods to process such data and contribute to non-invasive diagnostics of skin cancers whose incidence is steadily increasing.', metadata={'PMID': '38375145', 'TI': 'A dataset of optical spectra and clinical features acquired on human healthy skin and on skin carcinomas.', 'FAU': 'Elsen, Thomas Fauvel, Clement Khairallah, Gregoire Zghal, Ahmed Delconte, Alain Kupriyanov, Valentin Blondel, Walter Amouroux, Marine', 'AU': 'Elsen T Fauvel C Khairallah G Zghal A Delconte A Kupriyanov V Blondel W Amouroux M', 'DP': NaT, 'MH': 'None', 'OT': 'Actinic keratoses Autofluorescence Basal cell carcinomas Clinical study Diffuse reflectance Healthy skin Human skin cancer In vivo measurement Optical spectroscopy Spatial resolution Squamous cell carcinomas', 'PL': 'Netherlands', 'JT': 'Data in brief', 'PMC': 'PMC10875235', 'EDAT': NaT, 'MHDA': NaT, 'STAT': 'PubMed-not-MEDLINE'}),\n",

Improving the precision of COVID-19 infection forecasts can aid in making informed decisions regarding interventions, given the pandemic's harmful impact on numerous aspects of human life, such as health and the economy. This study aims to predict the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Saudi Arabia using Bayesian optimization (BOA) and deep learning (DL) methods. Two methods were assessed for their efficacy in predicting the occurrence of positive cases of COVID-19. The research employed data from confirmed COVID-19 cases in Saudi Arabia (SA), the United Kingdom (UK), and Tunisia (TU) from 2020 to 2021. The findings from the BOA model indicate that accurately predicting the number of COVID-19 positive cases is difficult due to the BOA projections needing to align with the assumptions. Thus, a DL approach was utilized to enhance the precision of COVID-19 positive case prediction in South Africa. The DQN model performed better than the BOA model when assessing RMSE and MAPE values. The model operates on a local server infrastructure, where the trained policy is transmitted solely to DQN. DQN formulated a reward function to amplify the efficiency of the DQN algorithm. By examining the rate of change and duration of sleep in the test data, this function can enhance the DQN model's training. Based on simulation findings, it can decrease the DQN work cycle by roughly 28% and diminish data overhead by more than 50% on average.\", metadata={'PMID': '38375088', 'TI': 'Artificial intelligence in healthcare: combining deep learning and Bayesian optimization to forecast COVID-19 confirmed cases.', 'FAU': 'Alhhazmi, Areej Alferidi, Ahmad Almutawif, Yahya A Makhdoom, Hatim Albasri, Hibah M Sami, Ben Slama', 'AU': 'Alhhazmi A Alferidi A Almutawif YA Makhdoom H Albasri HM Sami BS', 'DP': NaT, 'MH': 'None', 'OT': 'Bayesian optimization COVID-19 algorithm artificial intelligence decision-making deep reinforcement learning healthcare prediction', 'PL': 'Switzerland', 'JT': 'Frontiers in artificial intelligence', 'PMC': 'PMC10875994', 'EDAT': NaT, 'MHDA': NaT, 'STAT': 'PubMed-not-MEDLINE'}),\n",

Current methods for evaluating CMR studies are laborious and time-consuming, contributing to delays for patients. As the demand for CMR increases, there is a growing need to automate this process. The application of artificial intelligence (AI) to CMR is promising, but the evaluation of these tools in clinical practice has been limited. This study assessed the clinical viability of an automatic tool for measuring cardiac volumes on CMR. METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent CMR for any indication between January 2022 and October 2022 at a single tertiary centre were included prospectively. For each case, short-axis CMR images were segmented by the AI tool and manually to yield volume, mass and ejection fraction measurements for both ventricles. Automated and manual measurements were compared for agreement and the quality of the automated contours was assessed visually by cardiac radiologists. RESULTS: 462 CMR studies were included. No statistically significant difference was demonstrated between any automated and manual measurements (p > 0.05; independent T-test). Intraclass correlation coefficient and Bland-Altman analysis showed excellent agreement across all metrics (ICC > 0.85). The automated contours were evaluated visually in 251 cases, with agreement or minor disagreement in 229 cases (91.2%) and failed segmentation in only a single case (0.4%). The AI tool was able to provide automated contours in under 90 s. CONCLUSIONS: Automated segmentation of both ventricles on CMR by an automatic tool shows excellent agreement with manual segmentation performed by CMR experts in a retrospective real-world clinical cohort.

However, the brain mechanisms underlying the CR effect on the non-dementia AD spectrum (subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI)) are unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential moderate effect of CR on brain functional networks associated with cognitive performance. METHODS: We selected 200 participants, including 48 cognitively normal (CN) and 56 SCD, and 96 patients with MCI from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Seed-based locus coeruleus functional connectivity (LC FC) was conducted to detect early brain functional changes in the non-dementia AD spectrum. CR was assessed via years of education and intelligence (IQ). The ANDI composite executive function scores (ADNI-EF) and ADNI composite memory scores (ANDI-MEM) at baseline and 24-month follow-up were used to assess cognitive performance. RESULTS: Compared to the CN group, the SCD group showed abnormal LC FC with the executive control network (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, DLPFC), salience network, sensorimotor network, reward network, and hippocampus, while these alterations were inverted at the MCI stage. The LC-hippocampus FC was correlated with ADNI-MEM at baseline and follow-up, and these relationships were moderated by education. The LC-DLPFC FC was correlated with ADNI-EF at baseline, and this association was moderated by IQ.

In the case of supported catalysts, the role of the support material can be also crucial. Here, we address this intricacy challenge by a symbolic-regression artificial intelligence (AI) approach. We identify the key physicochemical parameters correlated with the measured performance, out of many offered candidate parameters characterizing the materials, reaction environment, and possibly relevant underlying phenomena. Importantly, these parameters are obtained by both experiments and ab initio simulations. The identified key parameters might be called \"materials genes\", in analogy to genes in biology: they correlate with the property or function of interest, but the explicit physical relationship is not (necessarily) known. To demonstrate the approach, we investigate the CO(2) hydrogenation catalyzed by cobalt nanoparticles supported on silica. Crucially, the silica support is modified with the additive metals magnesium, calcium, titanium, aluminum, or zirconium, which results in six materials with significantly different performances. These systems mimic hydrothermal vents, which might have produced the first organic molecules on Earth.

INTRODUCTION: Precision medicine, especially in the field of minimally-invasive partial nephrectomy, aims to use 3D virtual models as a guidance for augmented reality robotic procedures. However, the co-registration process of the virtual images over the real operative field is performed manually. METHODS: In this prospective study, two strategies for the automatic overlapping of the model over the real kidney were explored: the computer vision technology, leveraging the super-enhancement of the kidney allowed by the intraoperative injection of Indocyanine green for superimposition and the convolutional neural network technology, based on the processing of live images from the endoscope, after a training of the software on frames from prerecorded videos of the same surgery.

This study explored feature extraction, automated cropping, and classification of impacted and non-impacted canines as a first step. METHODS: A convolutional neural network (CNN) with SqueezeNet architecture was first trained to classify two groups of PRs (91with, and 91without impacted canines) on the MATLAB programming platform. Based on results, the need to crop the PRs was realized. Next, artificial intelligence (AI) detectors were trained to identify specific landmarks (maxillary central incisors, lateral incisors, canines, bicuspids, nasal area, and the mandibular ramus) on the PRs. Landmarks were then explored to guide cropping of the PRs. Finally, improvements in classification of automatically cropped PRs was studied. RESULTS: Without cropping, the area under the curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve for classifying impacted and non-impacted canine was 84%. Landmark training showed that detectors could correctly identify upper central incisors and the ramus in  approximately 98% of PRs.

Automated, deep learning-based prediction of breast density could provide subject-specific risk assessment and flag difficult cases during screening. However, there is a lack of evidence for generalisability across imaging techniques and, importantly, across race. METHODS: This study used a large, racially diverse dataset with 69,697 mammographic studies comprising 451,642 individual images from 23,057 female participants. A deep learning model was developed for four-class BI-RADS density prediction. A comprehensive performance evaluation assessed the generalisability across two imaging techniques, full-field digital mammography (FFDM) and two-dimensional synthetic (2DS) mammography. A detailed subgroup performance and bias analysis assessed the generalisability across participants' race. RESULTS: Here we show that a model trained on FFDM-only achieves a 4-class BI-RADS classification accuracy of 80.5% (79.7-81.4) on FFDM and 79.4% (78.5-80.2) on unseen 2DS data. When trained on both FFDM and 2DS images, the performance increases to 82.3% (81.4-83.0) and 82.3% (81.3-83.1). Racial subgroup analysis shows unbiased performance across Black, White, and Asian participants, despite a separate analysis confirming that race can be predicted from the images with a high accuracy of 86.7% (86.0-87.4).

At the first level of RTCF, a non-stationary generalised extreme value (GEV) model is developed to estimate the rear-end crash risk in real time (i.e., at a signal cycle level). Artificial intelligence techniques, like YOLO and DeepSort were used to extract traffic conflicts and time-varying covariates from traffic movement videos at three signalised intersections in Queensland, Australia. The estimated crash frequency from the non-stationary GEV model is compared against the historical crashes for the study locations (serving as ground truth), and the results indicate a close match between the estimated and observed crashes. Notably, the estimated mean crashes lie within the confidence intervals of observed crashes, further demonstrating the accuracy of the extreme value model. At the second level of RTCF, the estimated signal cycle crash risk is fed to a recurrent neural network to predict the crash risk of the subsequent signal cycles.

Steel plate-based dampers offer significant benefits in terms of mode shapes and failure mechanisms, contributing to improved dynamic performance, enhanced structural resilience, and increased safety of civil engineering structures. Their effectiveness in mitigating dynamic loads makes them a valuable tool for engineers designing structures to withstand extreme environmental conditions and seismic events. This study was undertaken by using the learning abilities of the response surface methodology (RSM), artificial neural network (ANN) and the evolutionary polynomial regression (EPR). Steel plate dampers are special structural designs used to withstand the effect of special loading conditions especially seismic effects. Its design based on the prediction of its stiffness (K) and slenderness factor (lambda) cannot be overlooked in the present-day artificial intelligence technology. In this research work, thirty-three entries based on the steel plate damper geometrical properties were recorded and deployed for the intelligent forecast of the fundamental properties (lambda and K).

Many high-altitude infrastructure developments around the world were thus planned and executed with no regard to possible impacts on bats and caused millions of bat fatalities. BATScan, the first automatic bat identifier for radar, demonstrates how artificial intelligence can be implemented together with ecological insight to solve basic scientific questions and minimise negative human impact on natural habitats. We demonstrate a facet of the complexity of bat aero-ecology using the Israeli BATScan database and substantiate the claim that activities taken by the wind energy industry to minimise bat mortality may prove limited and leave bats unprotected. We further discuss upcoming challenges in the face of a forthcoming transportation revolution that will change the human-aerial wildlife conflict from a conservation concern to a major human safety issue.', metadata={'PMID': '38373435', 'TI': 'Human-wildlife conflicts in the aerial habitat: Wind farms are just the beginning.', 'FAU': 'Werber, Yuval', 'AU': 'Werber Y', 'DP': NaT, 'MH': 'Animals Humans *Animals, Wild *Chiroptera Artificial Intelligence Energy-Generating Resources Wind Ecosystem', 'OT': 'Radar UAV aero-ecology bats conservation drones machine learning wind energy', 'PL': 'England', 'JT': 'Science progress', 'PMC': 'PMC10878230', 'EDAT': NaT, 'MHDA': NaT, 'STAT': 'MEDLINE'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"This study addresses a fundamental limitation of In-beam Positron Emission Tomography (IB-PET) in proton therapy: the lack of direct anatomical representation in the images it produces. We aim to overcome this shortcoming by pioneering the application of deep learning techniques to create synthetic control CT images (sCT) from combining IB-PET and planning CT scan data.&#xD;&#xD;Approach. We conducted simulations involving six patients who underwent irradiation with proton beams. Leveraging the architecture of a Visual Transformer (ViT) Neural Network (NN), we developed a model to generate sCT images of these patients using the planning CT scans and the inter-fractional simulated PET activity maps during irradiation. To evaluate the model's performance, a comparison was conducted between the sCT images produced by the ViT model and the authentic control CT images - serving as the benchmark.&#xD;&#xD;Main Results. The Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) was computed at a mean value across all patients of 0.91, while the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) measured 22 Hounsfield Units (HU). Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) values were 56 HU and 30 dB, respectively. The Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) exhibited a value of 0.98. These values are comparable to or exceed those found in the literature. More than 70% of the synthetic morphological changes were found to be geometrically compatible with the ones reported in the real control CT scan.&#xD;&#xD;Significance. Our study presents an innovative approach to surface the hidden anatomical information of IB-PET in proton therapy. Our ViT-based model successfully generates sCT images from inter-fractional PET data and planning CT scans.

The present study addressed two methodological limitations of previous work that may explain conflicting results: The inconsistent use of (a) accuracy-based vs. reaction time-based indicators and (b) average performance vs. difference scores. In a sample of 148 participants who completed a battery of executive function tasks, we tried to replicate the three-factor model of the three commonly distinguished executive functions shifting, updating, and inhibition by adopting data-analytical choices of previous work. After addressing the identified methodological limitations using drift-diffusion modeling, we only found one common factor of executive functions that was fully accounted for by individual differences in the speed of information uptake. No variance specific to executive functions remained. Our results suggest that individual differences common to all executive function tasks measure nothing more than individual differences in the speed of information uptake. We therefore suggest refraining from using typical executive function tasks to study substantial research questions, as these tasks are not valid for measuring individual differences in executive functions.', metadata={'PMID': '38372769', 'TI': 'The common factor of executive functions measures nothing but speed of information uptake.', 'FAU': 'Loffler, Christoph Frischkorn, Gidon T Hagemann, Dirk Sadus, Kathrin Schubert, Anna-Lena', 'AU': 'Loffler C Frischkorn GT Hagemann D Sadus K Schubert AL', 'DP': Timestamp('2024-02-19 00:00:00'), 'MH': 'None', 'OT': 'None', 'PL': 'Germany', 'JT': 'Psychological research', 'PMC': 'None', 'EDAT': NaT, 'MHDA': NaT, 'STAT': 'Publisher'}),\n",

However, its actual implementation and certification for practical use are currently limited, often due to challenges related to model transferability. In this context, we investigate the factors influencing transferability and present methods aimed at enhancing the utilization of AI algorithms in pathology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Various convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) were trained using datasets from two institutions, along with the publicly available TCGA-MIBC dataset. These networks conducted predictions in urothelial tissue and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA). The objective was to illustrate the impact of stain normalization, the influence of various artifacts during both training and testing, as well as the effects of the NoisyEnsemble method. RESULTS: We were able to demonstrate that stain normalization of slides from different institutions has a significant positive effect on the inter-institutional transferability of CNNs and ViTs (respectively +13% and +10%). In addition, ViTs usually achieve a higher accuracy in the external test (here +1.5%). Similarly, we showcased how artifacts in test data can negatively affect CNN predictions and how incorporating these artifacts during training leads to improvements. Lastly, NoisyEnsembles of CNNs (better than ViTs) were shown to enhance transferability across different tissues and research questions (+7% Bladder, +15% iCCA). DISCUSSION: It is crucial to be aware of the transferability challenge: achieving good performance during development does not necessarily translate to good performance in real-world applications.

Currently, the lack of advanced stratification models makes personalized therapy difficult. This study aims to identify novel biomarkers to stratify high-risk OSA patients and guide treatment. METHODS: We combined 10 machine-learning algorithms into 101 combinations, from which the optimal model was established for predicting overall survival based on transcriptomic profiles for 254 samples. Alterations in transcriptomic, genomic and epigenomic landscapes were assessed to elucidate mechanisms driving poor prognosis. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) unveiled genes overexpressed in OSA cells as potential therapeutic targets, one of which was validated via tissue staining, knockdown and pharmacological inhibition. We characterized changes in multiple phenotypes, including proliferation, colony formation, migration, invasion, apoptosis, chemosensitivity and in vivo tumourigenicity. RNA-seq and Western blotting elucidated the impact of squalene epoxidase (SQLE) suppression on signalling pathways. RESULTS: The artificial intelligence-derived prognostic index (AIDPI), generated by our model, was an independent prognostic biomarker, outperforming clinicopathological factors and previously published signatures. Incorporating the AIDPI with clinical factors into a nomogram improved predictive accuracy. For user convenience, both the model and nomogram are accessible online. Patients in the high-AIDPI group exhibited chemoresistance, coupled with overexpression of MYC and SQLE, increased mTORC1 signalling, disrupted PI3K-Akt signalling, and diminished immune infiltration. ScRNA-seq revealed high expression of MYC and SQLE in OSA cells. Elevated SQLE expression correlated with chemoresistance and worse outcomes in OSA patients. Therapeutically, silencing SQLE suppressed OSA malignancy and enhanced chemosensitivity, mediated by cholesterol depletion and suppression of the FAK/PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. Furthermore, the SQLE-specific inhibitor FR194738 demonstrated anti-OSA effects in vivo and exhibited synergistic effects with chemotherapeutic agents.

Unfortunately, many CGM users, and clinicians, find interpreting the large volume of CGM data to be overwhelming and complex. To address this challenge, an efficient, intelligent method for detecting and classifying discernable patterns in CGM data was desired. METHODS: We developed an automated artificial intelligence (AI)-driven method to detect and classify different discernable CGM patterns which called \"CGM events.\" We trained different models using 60 days of CGM data from 27 individuals with diabetes from a publicly available data set and then evaluated model performance using separate test data from the same group. Each event is classified according to clinical significance based on three parameters: (1) glucose category at or near the beginning of the CGM event; (2) a calculated severity score that encompasses both signal shape and temporal characteristics (e.g., how high the CGM curve goes (measured in mg/dL) and how long it stays above target (as established by published consensus guidelines); and (3) the glucose category at or near the end of the event. RESULTS: The system accurately detected and classified events from actual CGM data. This was also validated with expert diabetes clinicians.

The current study aims to analyze the relationships between daytime sleep duration (DSD) during infancy and cognitive development at 6 and 10 years. METHODS: The study included 262 mothers with their newborns from the Shanghai Sleep Birth Cohort Study, spanning eleven follow-ups from 42 days to 10 years. Sleep parameters were assessed using parent-report questionnaires at each follow-up, and cognitive development was evaluated with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, 4th edition at 6 and 10 years. RESULTS: Two distinct DSD trajectories in early childhood were identified: \"typical DSD\" (66.7%) and \"infancy excessive DSD\" (33.3%). Children in the \"infancy excessive DSD\" trajectory exhibited lower working memory scores than those in the \"typical DSD\" trajectory at 6 years (Mean difference=5.90, 95% CI [1.83, 9.96], p=0.005) and 10 years (Mean difference=4.37, 95% CI [0.26, 8.48], p=0.037). Additional analysis in a relatively homogeneous sample consistently showed correlations between DSD trajectories and working memory performance. No consistent significant differences were found in other domains of cognitive development.

       " Document(page_content=\"Quantitative analysis of irregular anatomical structures is crucial in oral medicine, but clinicians often typically measure only several representative indicators within the structure as references. Deep learning semantic segmentation offers the potential for entire quantitative analysis. However, challenges persist, including segmentation difficulties due to unclear boundaries and acquiring measurement landmarks for clinical needs in entire quantitative analysis. Taking the palatal alveolar bone as an example, we proposed an artificial intelligence measurement tool for the entire quantitative analysis of irregular dental structures. To expand the applicability, we have included lightweight networks with fewer parameters and lower computational demands. Our approach finally used the lightweight model LU-Net, addressing segmentation challenges caused by unclear boundaries through a compensation module. Additional enamel segmentation was conducted to establish a measurement coordinate system. Ultimately, we presented the entire quantitative information within the structure in a manner that meets clinical needs. The tool achieved excellent segmentation results, manifested by high Dice coefficients (0.934 and 0.949), intersection over union (0.888 and 0.907), and area under the curve (0.943 and 0.949) for palatal alveolar bone and enamel in the test set. In subsequent measurements, the tool visualizes the quantitative information within the target structure by scatter plots. When comparing the measurements against representative indicators, the tool's measurement results show no statistically significant difference from the ground truth, with small mean absolute error, root mean squared error, and errors interval. Bland-Altman plots and intraclass correlation coefficients indicate the satisfactory agreement compared with manual measurements. We proposed a novel intelligent approach to address the entire quantitative analysis of irregular image structures in the clinical setting.

One out of every three deaths is attributed to cardiovascular disease, according to new World Heart Federation research. Cardiovascular disease can be caused by a number of factors, including stress, alcohol, smoking, a poor diet, inactivity, and other medical disorders like high blood pressure or diabetes. In contrast, for the vast majority of heart disorders, early diagnosis of associated ailments results in permanent recovery. Using newly developed data analysis technology, examining a patient's medical record could aid in the early detection of cardiovascular disease. Recent work has employed machine learning algorithms to predict cardiovascular illness on clinical datasets. However, because of their enormous dimension and class imbalance, clinical datasets present serious issues. An inventive model is offered in this work for addressing these problems. An efficient decision support system, also known as an assistive system, is proposed in this paper for the diagnosis and classification of cardiovascular disorders. It makes use of an optimisation technique and a deep learning classifier. The efficacy of traditional techniques for predicting cardiovascular disease using medical data is anticipated to advance with the combination of the two methodologies. Deep learning systems can reduce mortality rates by predicting cardiovascular illness based on clinical data and the patient's severity level. For an adequate sample size of synthesized samples, the optimisation process chooses the right parameters to yield the best prediction from an enhanced classifier.

However, concerns have been raised about the fairness of evaluators, such as artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. This study aimed to assess college students' perceptions of fairness in educational evaluation scenarios through three studies using experimental vignettes. METHODS: Three studies were conducted involving 172 participants in Study 1, 149 in Study 2, and 145 in Study 3. Different evaluation contexts were used in each study to assess the influence of evaluators on students' perception of fairness. Information transparency and explanations for evaluation outcomes were also examined as potential moderators. RESULTS: Study 1 found that different evaluators could significantly influence the perception of fairness under three evaluation contexts. Students perceived AI algorithms as fairer evaluators than teachers. Study 2 revealed that information transparency was a mediator, indicating that students perceived higher fairness with AI algorithms due to increased transparency compared with teachers. Study 3 revealed that the explanation of evaluation outcomes moderated the effect of evaluator on students' perception of fairness. Specifically, when provided with explanations for evaluation results, the effect of evaluator on students' perception of fairness was lessened. DISCUSSION: This study emphasizes the importance of information transparency and comprehensive explanations in the evaluation process, which is more crucial than solely focusing on the type of evaluators. It also draws attention to potential risks like algorithmic hegemony and advocates for ethical considerations, including privacy regulations, in integrating new technologies into educational evaluation systems.

Automated labeling of intracranial arteries can facilitate the identification of risk factors associated with UIAs. This study aims to improve intracranial artery labeling using atlas-based features in graph convolutional networks. APPROACH: We included three-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography scans from 150 individuals. Two widely used graph convolutional operators, GCNConv and GraphConv, were employed in models trained to classify 12 bifurcations of interest. Cross-validation was applied to explore the effectiveness of atlas-based features in node classification. The results were tested for statistically significant differences using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Model repeatability and calibration were assessed on the test set for both operators. In addition, we evaluated model interpretability and node feature contribution using explainable artificial intelligence. RESULTS: Atlas-based features led to statistically significant improvements in node classification (p < 0.05). The results showed that the best discrimination and calibration performances were obtained using the GraphConv operator, which yielded a mean recall of 0.87, precision of 0.90, and expected calibration error of 0.02.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 136 adaptive fractions across 21 cervical cancer patients with nodal disease, we extracted 649 clinically-delivered and AID clinical target volume (CTV) lymph node boost structures. We assessed geometric alignment between AID and clinical CTVs via dice similarity coefficient, and 95% Hausdorff distance, and geometric coverage of clinical CTVs by AID planning target volumes by false positive dice. Coverage of clinical CTVs by AID contour-based plans was evaluated using D100, D95, V100%, and V95%. RESULTS: Between AID and clinical CTVs, the median dice similarity coefficient was 0.66 and the median 95 % Hausdorff distance was 4.0 mm.

METHODS: A prospective study was performed. Children who had (PET-)CT-scan underwent additional MRI. sCT-CT image quality was analyzed by two readers subjectively overall, semi-quantitatively in terms of cortical delineation, joint facet defects, growth plate fusion, ossified nuclei, lumbosacral transitional anomaly, and bony bridges, and quantitatively for disc space height, spinal canal width, and sacral vertebrae width and height. Cohen's kappa and equivalence analyses with Bland-Altman plots were calculated for categorical and continuous measures respectively. RESULTS: Ten patients were included (6 boys; aged 9-16 years; mean age 14 years). Overall sCT image quality was rated good. Semi-quantitative assessment of cortical delineation of sacroiliac joints, bony bridges, and joint facet defects on the right iliac and sacral sides showed perfect agreement. Correlation was good to excellent (kappa 0.615-1) for the presence of lumbosacral transitional anomaly, fusion of sacral growth plates, joint facet defect, and presence of ossified nuclei. sCT-CT measurements were statistically equivalent and within the equivalence margins (-1-1 mm) for intervertebral disc space height and spinal canal width. Intra- and inter-reader reliability was excellent for quantitative assessment (0.806 < ICC < 0.998). For categorical scoring, kappa ranged from substantial to excellent (0.615-1). CONCLUSION: sCT appears to be visually equivalent to CT for the assessment of pediatric sacroiliac joints. sCT may aid in visualizing sacroiliac joints compared to conventional MRI, with the benefit that no ionizing radiation is used, especially important in children.

Its exceptional performance, particularly suitable for resource-limited clinical settings, demonstrates its potential for clinical application in breast cancer screening.

In response to growing and changing evidence, the National Collaborating Centre for Methods and Tools in Canada maintained a living rapid review on the role of schools and daycares in COVID-19 transmission to guide evidence-informed decision making. This Review presents the final iteration of this living rapid review. 31 sources were searched until Oct 17, 2022. In the final version, eligible studies reported data from Jan 1, 2021 onward on transmission of COVID-19 in school or daycare settings, the effect of infection prevention and control measures on transmission, or the effect of operating schools or daycares on community-level COVID-19 rates. As a rapid review, titles and abstracts were screened by a single reviewer with artificial intelligence integrated into later versions. Full-text screening, data extraction, and critical appraisal were completed by one reviewer and checked by a second reviewer. The Johanna Briggs Institute tools were used for critical appraisal. The certainty of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach, and results were synthesised narratively. Three citizen partners provided input for the final interpretation. This final update includes 73 primary studies. Secondary attack rates were low within school settings when infection prevention and control measures were in place (moderate certainty). Masks might reduce transmission, test-to-stay policies might not increase transmission risk compared with mandatory quarantine, cohorting and hybrid learning might make little to no difference in transmission (low certainty), and the effect of surveillance testing within schools remained inconclusive (very low certainty). Findings indicate that school settings do not substantially contribute to community incidence, hospitalisations, or mortality (low certainty).

       " Document(page_content='Biochar is a carbon-neutral tool for combating climate change. Artificial intelligence applications to estimate the biochar mitigation effect on greenhouse gases (GHGs) can assist scientists in making more informed solutions. However, there is also evidence indicating that biochar promotes, rather than reduces, N(2)O emissions. Thus, the effect of biochar on N(2)O remains uncertain in constructed wetlands (CWs), and there is not a characterization metric for this effect, which increases the difficulty and inaccuracy of biochar-driven alleviation effect projections. Here, we provide new insight by utilizing machine learning-based, tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) optimization assisted by a meta-analysis to estimate the potency of biochar-driven N(2)O mitigation. We first synthesized datasets that contained 80 studies on global biochar-amended CWs. The mitigation effect size was then calculated and further introduced as a new metric. TPE optimization was then applied to automatically tune the hyperparameters of the built extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and random forest (RF), and the optimum TPE-XGBoost obtained adequately achieved a satisfactory prediction accuracy for N(2)O flux (R(2) = 91.90%, RPD = 3.57) and the effect size (R(2) = 92.61%, RPD = 3.59). Results indicated that a high influent chemical oxygen demand/total nitrogen (COD/TN) ratio and the COD removal efficiency interpreted by the Shapley value significantly enhanced the effect size contribution. COD/TN ratio made the most and the second greatest positive contributions among 22 input variables to N(2)O flux and to the effect size that were up to 18% and 14%, respectively. By combining with a structural equation model analysis, NH(4)(+)-N removal rate had significant negative direct effects on the N(2)O flux.

METHODS: Twenty-seven patients were studied, comprising 15 patients who underwent language-dominant side resection (LDR) and 12 patients who had languagenondominant side resection (n-LDR). We evaluated intelligence (language function, arithmetic ability, working memory, processing speed, visuo-spatial reasoning), executive function, and memory in these patients before and two years after resection surgery. We analyzed the relationship between neuropsychological outcome and resected regions (side of language dominance and location). RESULTS: Although 75% of the patients showed improvement or no change in individual neuropsychological tests after surgical intervention, 25% showed decline. The cognitive tests that showed improvement or decline varied between LDR and n-LDR. In patients who had LDR, decline was observed in Vocabulary and Phonemic Fluency (both 5/15 patients), especially after resection of ventrolateral frontal cortex, and improvement was observed in WCST-Category (7/14 patients), Block Design (6/15 patients), Digit Symbol (4/15 patients), and Delayed Recall (3/9 patients). In patients who underwent n-LDR, improvement was observed in Vocabulary (3/12 patients), but decline was observed in Block Design (2/9 patients), and WCST-Category (2/9 patients) after resection of dorsolateral frontal cortex; and Arithmetic (3/10 patients) declined after resection of dorsolateral frontal cortex or ventrolateral frontal cortex. General Memory (3/8 patients), Visual Memory (3/8 patients), Delayed Recall (3/8 patients), Verbal Memory (2/9 patients), and Digit Symbol (3/12 patients) also declined after n-LDR.

These situations can lead to accidents and falls, resulting in injuries that range from minor bruises to severe fractures or head trauma. To mitigate such risks, the use of slip resistant footwear plays a crucial role. In this study, we aimed to develop an Artificial Intelligence model capable of classifying footwear as having either high or low slip resistance based on the geometric characteristics and material parameters of their outsoles. Our model was trained on a unique dataset comprising images of 37 indoor work footwear outsoles made of rubber. To evaluate the slip resistant property of the footwear, all samples were tested using a cart-type friction measurement device, and the static and dynamic Coefficient of Frictions (COFs) of each outsole was determined on a glycerol-contaminated surface. Machine learning techniques were implemented, and a classification model was developed to determine high and low slip resistant footwear. Among the various models evaluated, the Support Vector Classifier (SVC) obtained the best results. This model achieved an accuracy of 0.68 +/- 0.15 and an F1-score of 0.68 +/- 0.20.

       " Document(page_content=\"PURPOSE: Proton therapy is sensitive to anatomical changes, often occurring in head-and-neck (HN) cancer patients. Although multiple studies have proposed online adaptive proton therapy (APT), there is still a concern in the radiotherapy community about the necessity of online APT. We have performed a retrospective study to investigate the potential dosimetric benefits of online APT for HN patients relative to the current offline APT. METHODS: Our retrospective study has a patient cohort of 10 cases. To mimic online APT, we re-evaluated the dose of the in-use treatment plan on patients' actual treatment anatomy captured by cone-beam CT (CBCT) for each fraction and performed a templated-based automatic replanning if needed, assuming that these were performed online before treatment delivery. Cumulative dose of the simulated online APT course was calculated and compared with that of the actual offline APT course and the designed plan dose of the initial treatment plan (referred to as nominal plan). The ProKnow scoring system was employed and adapted for our study to quantify the actual quality of both courses against our planning goals. RESULTS: The average score of the nominal plans over the 10 cases is 41.0, while those of the actual offline APT course and our simulated online course is 25.8 and 37.5, respectively. Compared to the offline APT course, our online course improved dose quality for all cases, with the score improvement ranging from 0.4 to 26.9 and an average improvement of 11.7. CONCLUSION: The results of our retrospective study have demonstrated that online APT can better address anatomical changes for HN cancer patients than the current offline replanning practice. The advanced artificial intelligence based automatic replanning technology presents a promising avenue for extending potential benefits of online APT.\", metadata={'PMID': '38368614', 'TI': 'A retrospective study on the investigation of potential dosimetric benefits of online adaptive proton therapy for head and neck cancer.', 'FAU': 'Chang, Chih-Wei Bohannon, Duncan Tian, Zhen Wang, Yinan Mcdonald, Mark W Yu, David S Liu, Tian Zhou, Jun Yang, Xiaofeng', 'AU': 'Chang CW Bohannon D Tian Z Wang Y Mcdonald MW Yu DS Liu T Zhou J Yang X', 'DP': Timestamp('2024-02-18 00:00:00'), 'MH': 'None', 'OT': 'head-and-neck cancer offline adaptive proton therapy online adaptive proton therapy treatment outcome', 'PL': 'United States', 'JT': 'Journal of applied clinical medical physics', 'PMC': 'None', 'EDAT': NaT, 'MHDA': NaT, 'STAT': 'Publisher'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the clinical impact of an artificial intelligence (Al)-based decision support system (DSS), Koios DS, on the analysis of ultrasound imaging and suspicious characteristics for thyroid nodule risk stratification Methods: A retrospective ultrasound study was conducted on all thyroid nodules with histological findings from June 2021 to December 2022 in a thyroid nodule clinic. The diagnostic performance of ultrasound imaging was evaluated by six readers on American College of Radiology Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (ACR TI-RADS) before and after the use of the AI-based DSS, and by the AI itself. RESULTS: A total of 172 patients (83.1% women) with a mean age of 52.3+/-15.3 years were evaluated. The mean maximum nodular diameter was 2.9+/-1.2 cm, with 11.0% being differentiated thyroid carcinomas. Among the nodules initially classified as ACR TI-RADS 3 and 4, Al reclassified 81.4% and 24.5% into lower risk categories, respectively.Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the readers and the AI-based DSS versus histological diagnosis. There was an increase in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) after the use of Al (0.776 vs. 0.817, p<0.001). The AI-based DSS improved the mean sensitivity (82.3% vs. 86.5%) and specificity (38.3% vs. 54.8%), produced a high negative predictive value (94.5% vs. 96.4%), and increased the positive predictive value (14.0% vs. 16.1%) and diagnostic precision (43.0% vs. 49.3%). Based on the ACR TI-RADS score, there was a significant improvement in interobserver agreement after the use of Al (r=0.741 for ultrasound imaging alone vs. 0.981 for ultrasound imaging and the AI-based DSS, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The use of an AI-based DSS was associated with an overall improvement in the diagnostic efficacy of ultrasound imaging, based on the AUROC, as well as an increase in sensitivity, specificity, the negative and positive predictive value, and diagnostic accuracy. There was also a reduction in interobserver variability and an increase in the degree of concordance with the use of Al.

This study employs the SuperCon dataset as the largest superconducting materials dataset. Then, we perform various data pre-processing steps to derive the clean DataG dataset, containing 13,022 compounds.

The main objective is to efficiently meet pulsed load (PL) demands and extract maximum energy from the photovoltaic (PV) array. The proposed approach establishes a simple IF-THEN set of rules to define the search space, including PV, battery bank (BB), and ultracapacitor (UC) constraints. GOA then dynamically allocates power shares among PV, BB, and UC to meet PL demand based on these rules and search space. A comprehensive study is conducted to evaluate and compare the performance of the proposed technique with other well-known swarm intelligence techniques (SITs) such as the cuckoo search algorithm (CSA), gray wolf optimization (GWO), and salp swarm algorithm (SSA). Evaluation is carried out for various cases, including PV alone without any energy storage device, variable PV with a constant load, variable PV with PL cases, and PV with maximum power point tracking (MPPT). Comparative analysis shows that the proposed technique outperforms the other SITs in terms of reducing power surges caused by PV power or load transition, oscillation mitigation, and MPP tracking. Specifically, for the variable PV with constant load case, it reduces the power surge by 26%, 22%, and 8% compared to CSA, GWO, and SSA, respectively. It also mitigates oscillations twice as fast as CSA and GWO and more than three times as fast as SSA. Moreover, it reduces the power surge by 9 times compared to CSA and GWO and by 6 times compared to SSA in variable PV with the PL case. Furthermore, its MPP tracking speed is approximately 29% to 61% faster than its counterparts, regardless of weather conditions.

Researchers are making significant efforts to study it, thanks to state-of-art technologies in data collection and processing, and to mitigate its effect. In this context, while a lot is known about the role of urbanization, industries, and transport, the impact of agricultural activities on the spatial distribution of pollution is less studied, despite knowledge about emissions suggest it is not a secondary factor. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess this impact, and to compare it with that of traditional polluting sources, harvesting the capabilities of GEOAI (Geomatics and Earth Observation Artificial Intelligence). The analysis targeted the highly polluted territory of Lombardy, Italy, considering fine particulate matter (PM2.5). PM2.5 data were obtained from the Copernicus-Atmosphere-Monitoring-Service and processed to infer time-invariant spatial parameters (frequency, intensity and exposure) of concentration across the whole period. An ensemble architecture was implemented, with three blocks: correlation-based features selection, Multiscale-Geographically-Weighted-Regression for spatial enhancement, and a final random forest classifier. Finally, the SHapley Additive exPlanation algorithm was applied to compute the relevance of the different land-use classes on the model. The impact of land-use classes was found significantly higher compared to other published models, showing that the insignificant correlations found in the literature are probably due to an unfit experimental setup. The impact of agricultural activities on the spatial distribution of PM2.5 concentration was comparable to the other considered sources, even when focusing only on the most densely inhabited urban areas. In particular, the agriculture's contribution resulted in pollution spikes rather than in a baseline increase.

METHODS: A total of 600 orthopantomographies were randomly selected for this study and manually annotated by a single operator using an image annotation tool (COCO Annotator v.11.0.1) to establish ground truth. The annotation classes included teeth, maxilla, mandible, inferior alveolar nerve, dento- and implant-supported crowns/pontics, endodontic treatment, resin-based restorations, metallic restorations, and implants. The dataset was then divided into training, validation, and testing subsets, which were used to train versions 5, 7, and 8 of You Only Look Once (YOLO) Neural Network. Results were stored, and a posterior performance analysis was carried out by calculating the precision (P), recall (R), F1 Score, Intersection over Union (IoU), and mean average precision (mAP) at 0.5 and 0.5-0.95 thresholds. The confusion matrix and recall precision graphs were also sketched. RESULTS: YOLOv5s showed an improvement in object detection results with an average R=0.634, P=0.781, mAP0.5=0.631, and mAP0.5-0.95=0.392. YOLOv7m achieved the best object detection results with average R=0.793, P=0.779, mAP0.5=0.740, and mAP0.5-0.95=0,481.

CONCLUSIONS: YOLOv7m was better suited for object detection, while YOLOv8m demonstrated superior performance in object segmentation. The most frequent error in object detection was related to background classification. Conversely, in object segmentation, there is a tendency to misclassify True Positives across different dental treatment categories.

The study included 77 cases via the Dutch nationwide Pathology databank. Immunohistochemistry for BMP2, SMAD4, and Osterix was performed. An AI algorithm assessed the tumour-stroma ratio to approximate the CMS. A literature search yielded 96 case reports, which were analysed and compared with our cases for clinicopathological parameters. HO was more frequently observed in our cohort in traditional serrated adenomas (25%), tubulovillous adenomas (25%) and juvenile polyps (25%), while in the literature it was most often seen in juvenile polyps (38.2%) and inflammatory polyps (29.4%). In both cohorts, carcinomas were mostly conventional (>60%) followed by mucinous and serrated adenocarcinomas. Higher expression of BMP2, SMAD4, and Osterix was observed in tumour and/or stromal cells directly surrounding bone, indicating activation of the BMP pathway. The tumour-stroma analysis appointed >50% of the cases to the mesenchymal subtype (CMS4) (59%). HO has a predilection for serrated and juvenile/inflammatory polyps, mucinous and serrated adenocarcinomas.

From AOP-Wiki, we filtered 309 high confidence AOPs, identified 312 key events (KEs) associated with inorganic cadmium from five exposome-relevant databases using a data-centric approach, and thereafter, curated 30 cadmium relevant AOPs (cadmium-AOPs). By constructing the undirected AOP network, we identified a large connected component of 18 cadmium-AOPs. Further, we analyzed the directed network of 59 KEs and 82 key event relationships (KERs) in the largest component using graph-theoretic approaches. Subsequently, we mined published literature using artificial intelligence-based tools to provide auxiliary evidence of cadmium association for all KEs in the largest component.

Then, label-free Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) analysis of blood-based biomarkers is a convenient alternative to rapidly obtain spectral information from biofluids. However, despite the rapid acquisition of spectral information from biofluids, it is challenging to distinguish spectral features of biomarkers due to interference from biofluidic components. Here, we introduce a deep learning-assisted, SERS-based platform for separate analysis of blood-based amyloid beta (1-42) and metabolites, enabling the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.

However, a measure of prediction certainty is lacking. OBJECTIVES: To assess a novel approach for estimating certainty of AI-ECG predictions. METHODS: Two convolutional neural networks (CNN) were developed to predict patient age and sex. Model 1 applied a 5 s sliding time-window, allowing multiple CNN predictions. The consistency of the output values, expressed as interquartile range (IQR), was used to estimate prediction certainty. Model 2 was trained on the full 10s ECG signal, resulting in a single CNN point prediction value. Performance was evaluated on an internal test set and externally validated on the PTB-XL dataset. RESULTS: Both CNNs were trained on 269,979 standard 12‑lead ECGs (82,477 patients). Model 1 showed higher accuracy for both age and sex prediction (mean absolute error, MAE 6.9 +/- 6.3 years vs. 7.7 +/- 6.3 years and AUC 0.946 vs. 0.916, respectively, P < 0.001 for both). The IQR of multiple CNN output values allowed to differentiate between high and low accuracy of ECG based predictions (P < 0.001 for both). Among 10% of patients with narrowest IQR, sex prediction accuracy increased from 65.4% to 99.2%, and MAE of age prediction decreased from 9.7 to 4.1 years compared to the 10% with widest IQR.

While the microbiome is considered to play a significant role on the disease course the impact of antibiotics is poorly understood. This study investigated the potential impact of different classes of antibiotics on course of disease in IBD using the Danish National Patient Registry. METHODS: Danish IBD patients were studied using two nested case-control cohorts exploring associations between antibiotic types and IBD flare-ups, defined as IBD-related hospitalizations and/or high-dose systemic steroid exposure. Multivariate logistic regression and eXtreme Gradient Boosted decision tree (GBDT) machine learning methods evaluated antibiotic risks. RESULTS: Two cohorts with 15,636 and 5,178 patients were analysed for risk of hospitalisation and course of steroids, respectively.The risk of a flare-up was significantly increased with antecedent exposure to quinolones (ATC:J01M. OR:3.04-3.82), antimycotics (ATC:J02A. OR:1.50-2.30), agents against amoebiasis and protozoal infections (ATC:P01A. OR: 1.95-3.18), intestinal anti-infectives (ATC:A07A.

There is a need to foster an environment conducive to medical technology development and validation so that Europe can continue to play a major role in device innovation while providing high standards of safety. This paper summarizes viewpoints on the topic of device innovation in cardiovascular medicine at the European Society of Cardiology Cardiovascular Round Table, a strategic forum for high-level dialogue to discuss issues related to the future of cardiovascular health in Europe. Devices are developed and improved through an iterative process throughout their lifecycle. Early feasibility studies demonstrate proof of concept and help to optimize the design of a device. If successful, this should ideally be followed by randomized clinical trials comparing novel devices vs. accepted standards of care when available and the collection of post-market real-world evidence through registries. Unfortunately, standardized procedures for feasibility studies across various device categories have not yet been implemented in Europe. Cardiovascular imaging can be used to diagnose and characterize patients for interventions to improve procedural results and to monitor devices long term after implantation. Randomized clinical trials often use cardiac imaging-based inclusion criteria, while less frequently trials randomize patients to compare the diagnostic or prognostic value of different modalities. Applications using machine learning are increasingly important, but specific regulatory standards and pathways remain in development in both Europe and the USA. Standards are also needed for smart devices and digital technologies that support device-driven biomonitoring. Changes in device regulation introduced by the European Union aim to improve clinical evidence, transparency, and safety, but they may impact the speed of innovation, access, and availability. Device development programmes including dialogue on unmet needs and advice on study designs must be driven by a community of physicians, trialists, patients, regulators, payers, and industry to ensure that patients have access to innovative care.', metadata={'PMID': '38366821', 'TI': 'Device innovation in cardiovascular medicine: a report from the European Society of Cardiology Cardiovascular Round Table.', 'FAU': \"Windecker, Stephan Gilard, Martine Achenbach, Stephan Cribier, Alain Delgado, Victoria Deych, Nataliya Drossart, Inga Eltchaninoff, Helene Fraser, Alan G Goncalves, Alexandra Hindricks, Gerhard Holborow, Richard Kappetein, Arie Pieter Kilmartin, John Kurucova, Jana Luscher, Thomas F Mehran, Roxana O'Connor, Donal B Perkins, Mark Samset, Eigil von Bardeleben, Ralph Stephan Weidinger, Franz\", 'AU': \"Windecker S Gilard M Achenbach S Cribier A Delgado V Deych N Drossart I Eltchaninoff H Fraser AG Goncalves A Hindricks G Holborow R Kappetein AP Kilmartin J Kurucova J Luscher TF Mehran R O'Connor DB Perkins M Samset E von Bardeleben RS Weidinger F\", 'DP': Timestamp('2024-02-16 00:00:00'), 'MH': 'None', 'OT': 'Artificial intelligence Cardiac surgery Fusion imaging Invasive cardiology Medical Device Regulation Transcatheter aortic valve implantation', 'PL': 'England', 'JT': 'European heart journal', 'PMC': 'None', 'EDAT': NaT, 'MHDA': NaT, 'STAT': 'Publisher'}),\n",

Specifically, we aim to assess whether ChatGPT can demonstrate clinical decision-making equivalent to that of expert nurses and novice nursing students. This will be evaluated by comparing ChatGPT responses to clinical scenarios to those of nurses on different levels of experience. DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional study. METHODS: Emergency room registered nurses (i.e. experts; n = 30) and nursing students (i.e. novices; n = 38) were recruited during March-April 2023. Clinical decision-making was measured using three validated clinical scenarios involving an initial assessment and reevaluation. Clinical decision-making aspects assessed were the accuracy of initial assessments, the appropriateness of recommended tests and resource use and the capacity to reevaluate decisions. Performance was also compared by timing response generations and word counts. Expert nurses and novice students completed online questionnaires (via Qualtrics), while ChatGPT responses were obtained from OpenAI. RESULTS: Concerning aspects of clinical decision-making and compared to novices and experts: (1) ChatGPT exhibited indecisiveness in initial assessments; (2) ChatGPT tended to suggest unnecessary diagnostic tests; (3) When new information required re-evaluation, ChatGPT responses demonstrated inaccurate understanding and inappropriate modifications. In terms of performance, the mean number of words utilized in ChatGPT answers was 27-41 times greater than that utilized by both experts and novices; and responses were provided approximately 4 times faster than those of novices and twice faster than expert nurses. ChatGPT responses maintained logical structure and clarity. CONCLUSIONS: A generative AI tool demonstrated indecisiveness and a tendency towards over-triage compared to human clinicians. IMPACT: The study shows that it is important to approach the implementation of ChatGPT as a nurse's digital assistant with caution. More study is needed to optimize the model's training and algorithms to provide accurate healthcare support that aids clinical decision-making.

We aim to identify key features in anti-vaping Instagram image posts associated with high social media user engagement by artificial intelligence. AIMS AND METHODS: We collected 8972 anti-vaping Instagram image posts and hand-coded 2200 Instagram images to identify nine image features such as warning signs and person-shown vaping. We utilized a deep-learning model, the OpenAI: contrastive language-image pre-training with ViT-B/32 as the backbone and a 5-fold cross-validation model evaluation, to extract similar features from the Instagram image and further trained logistic regression models for multilabel classification. Latent Dirichlet Allocation model and Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner were used to extract the topics and sentiment from the captions. Negative binomial regression models were applied to identify features associated with the likes and comments count of posts. RESULTS: Several features identified in anti-vaping Instagram image posts were significantly associated with high social media user engagement (likes or comments), such as educational warnings and warning signs. Instagram posts with captions about health risks associated with vaping received significantly more likes or comments than those about help quitting smoking or vaping. Compared to the model based on 2200 hand-coded Instagram image posts, more significant features have been identified from 8972 AI-labeled Instagram image posts. CONCLUSION: Features identified from anti-vaping Instagram image posts will provide a potentially effective way to communicate with the public about the health effects of e-cigarette use. IMPLICATIONS: Considering the increasing popularity of social media and the current vaping epidemic, especially among youth and young adults, it becomes necessary to understand e-cigarette-related content on social media. Although pro-vaping messages dominate social media, anti-vaping messages are limited and often have low user engagement.

In this study, we developed a DLM aimed at detecting solid organ injuries to assist medical professionals in rapidly identifying life-threatening injuries. The study enrolled patients from a single trauma center who received abdominal CT scans between 2008 and 2017. Patients with spleen, liver, or kidney injury were categorized as the solid organ injury group, while others were considered negative cases. Only images acquired from the trauma center were enrolled. A subset of images acquired in the last year was designated as the test set, and the remaining images were utilized to train and validate the detection models. The performance of each model was assessed using metrics such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value based on the best Youden index operating point. The study developed the models using 1302 (87%) scans for training and tested them on 194 (13%) scans. The spleen injury model demonstrated an accuracy of 0.938 and a specificity of 0.952. The accuracy and specificity of the liver injury model were reported as 0.820 and 0.847, respectively. The kidney injury model showed an accuracy of 0.959 and a specificity of 0.989.

Much larger effects were observed when the analysis was restricted to assessment tasks similar to those used for training (SMD = 1.15). Fluid intelligence was not found to improve as a result of training, and improvements in WM were not related to changes in fluid intelligence.

OBJECTIVE: We present a process analytical technology (PAT) tool for on-line and real-time charge variant determination during process scale CEX based on Raman spectroscopy employing machine learning techniques. METHOD: Raman spectra are collected from a reference library of samples with distribution of acidic, main, and basic species from 0-100% in a mAb concentration range of 0-20 g/L generated from process-scale CEX. The performance of different machine learning techniques for spectral processing is compared for predicting different charge variant species. RESULT: A convolutional neural network (CNN) based model was successfully calibrated for quantification of acidic species, main species, basic species, and total protein concentration with R(2) values of 0.94, 0.99, 0.96 and 0.99, respectively, and the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.1846, 0.1627, and 0.1029 g/L, respectively, and 0.2483 g/L for the total protein concentration.

       " Document(page_content='BACKGROUND: While prenatal exposure to alkylphenols (APs) has been demonstrated to be associated with neurodevelopmental impairments in animals, the evidence from epidemiological studies remains limited and inconclusive. This study aimed to explore the link between AP exposure during pregnancy and the intelligence quotient (IQ) of preschool children. METHODS: A total of 221 mother-child pairs from the Guangxi Zhuang Birth Cohort were recruited. Nonylphenol (NP), 4-tert-octylphenol (4-T-OP), 4-n-nonylphenol (4-N-NP), and 4-n-octylphenol were measured in maternal serum in early pregnancy. Childhood IQ was evaluated by the Fourth Edition of Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of the Intelligence at 3 to 6 years of age. The impact of APs on childhood IQ were evaluated by generalized linear models (GLMs), restricted cubic spline (RCS), and Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR). RESULTS: In GLMs, prenatal exposure to NP and the second tertile of 4-T-OP exhibited an inverse association with full-scale IQ (FSIQ) (beta = -2.38; 95% CI: -4.59, -0.16) and working memory index (WMI) (beta = -5.24; 95% CI: -9.58, -0.89), respectively. Prenatal exposure to the third tertile of 4-N-NP showed a positive association with the fluid reasoning index (beta = 4.95; 95% CI: 1.14, 8.77) in total children, as well as in girls when stratified by sex. A U-shaped relationship between maternal 4-T-OP and WMI was noted in total children and girls by RCS (all P nonlinear < 0.05). The combined effect primarily driven by NP, of maternal AP mixtures at concentrations above the 50th percentile exhibited an inverse trend on FSIQ in total children and girls in BKMR. CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal exposure to various APs affects IQ in preschool children, and there may be nonmonotonic and sex-specific effects.

       " Document(page_content=\"INTRODUCTION: Congenital anomalies are the most encountered cause of fetal death, infant mortality and morbidity. 7.9 million infants are born with congenital anomalies yearly. Early detection of congenital anomalies facilitates life-saving treatments and stops the progression of disabilities. Congenital anomalies can be diagnosed prenatally through morphology scans. A correct interpretation of the morphology scan allows a detailed discussion with the parents regarding the prognosis. The central feature of this project is the development of a specialised intelligent system that uses two-dimensional ultrasound movies obtained during the standard second trimester morphology scan to identify congenital anomalies in fetuses. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The project focuses on three pillars: committee of deep learning and statistical learning algorithms, statistical analysis, and operational research through learning curves. The cross-sectional study is divided into a training phase where the system learns to detect congenital anomalies using fetal morphology ultrasound scan, and then it is tested on previously unseen scans. In the training phase, the intelligent system will learn to answer the following specific objectives: (a) the system will learn to guide the sonographer's probe for better acquisition; (b) the fetal planes will be automatically detected, measured and stored and (c) unusual findings will be signalled. During the testing phase, the system will automatically perform the above tasks on previously unseen videos.Pregnant patients in their second trimester admitted for their routine scan will be consecutively included in a 32-month study (4 May 2022-31 December 2024). The number of patients is 4000, enrolled by 10 doctors/sonographers. We will develop an intelligent system that uses multiple artificial intelligence algorithms that interact between themselves, in bulk or individual. For each anatomical part, there will be an algorithm in charge of detecting it, followed by another algorithm that will detect whether anomalies are present or not. The sonographers will validate the findings at each intermediate step.

Although lung ultrasound (LUS) is often used to assess for PTX, its diagnostic accuracy varies based on patient and provider factors. To enhance the performance of LUS for pulmonary pathology, artificial intelligence (AI) assisted imaging has been adopted, however, the diagnostic accuracy of AI-Assisted LUS (AI-LUS) deployed in real-time to diagnose PTX remains unknown.

OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study are twofold: first, to create an array of interpretable machine learning (ML) models developed for predicting survival outcomes among SCG patients; and second, to integrate these models into an easily navigable online calculator to showcase their prospective clinical applicability. STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective, population-based cohort study aiming to predict the outcomes of interest, which were binary categorical variables, in SCG patients with ML models. PATIENT SAMPLE: The National Cancer Database (NCDB) was utilized to identify adults aged 18 years or older who were diagnosed with histologically confirmed SCGs between 2010 and 2019. OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcomes of interest were survival outcomes at three specific time points post-diagnosis: 1, 3, and 5 years. These outcomes were formed by combining the \"Vital Status\" and \"Last Contact or Death (Months from Diagnosis)\" variables. Model performance was evaluated visually and numerically. The visual evaluation utilized receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, precision-recall curves (PRCs), and calibration curves. The numerical evaluation involved metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, area under the PRC (AUPRC), area under the ROC curve (AUROC), and Brier Score. METHODS: We employed five ML algorithms-TabPFN, CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Random Forest-along with the Optuna library for hyperparameter optimization. The models that yielded the highest AUROC values were chosen for integration into the online calculator. To enhance the explicability of our models, we utilized SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) for assessing the relative significance of predictor variables and incorporated partial dependence plots (PDPs) to delineate the influence of singular variables on the predictions made by the top performing models. RESULTS: For the 1-year survival analysis, 4,913 patients [5.6% with 1-year mortality]; for the 3-year survival analysis, 4,027 patients (11.5% with 3-year mortality]; and for the 5-year survival analysis, 2,854 patients (20.4% with 5-year mortality) were included. The top models achieved AUROCs of 0.938 for 1-year mortality (TabPFN), 0.907 for 3-year mortality (LightGBM), and 0.902 for 5-year mortality (Random Forest).

Its applications are widespread both for physicians and patients, including use in clinical decision-making, in the operating room, and in research. In this study, we aimed to assess the quality of ChatGPT answers when asked questions related to total knee arthroplasty (TKA). METHODS: ChatGPT prompts were created by turning 15 of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) Clinical Practice Guidelines into questions. An online survey was created, which included screenshots of each prompt and answers to the 15 questions. Surgeons were asked to grade ChatGPT answers from 1 to 5 based on their characteristics: 1) Relevance; 2) Accuracy; 3) Clarity; 4) Completeness; 5) Evidence-based; and 6) Consistency. There were eleven Adult Joint Reconstruction fellowship-trained surgeons who completed the survey. Questions were subclassified based on the subject of the prompt: 1) risk factors, 2) implant/Intraoperative, and 3) pain/functional outcomes. The average and standard deviation for all answers, as well as for each subgroup, were calculated. Inter-rater reliability (IRR) was also calculated. RESULTS: All answer characteristics were graded as being above average (i.e., a score > 3). Relevance demonstrated the highest scores (4.43+/-0.77) by surgeons surveyed, and consistency demonstrated the lowest scores (3.54+/-1.10).

       " Document(page_content=\"BACKGROUND: Educational mobility at the macro-level is a common measure of social inequality. Nonetheless, the correlates of mobility of education at the individual level are less well studied. We evaluated whether educational mobility of the second generation (compared to the first generation level) predicts differences in parenting practices of the second generation and school achievement and intelligence in the third generation. METHODS: Data from a population-based cohort of children in the Netherlands (N = 3547; 49.4% boys) were analyzed. Maternal, grandparental education and family routines, a parenting practice, were reported by the mother. Child school achievement at the end of primary school ( approximately 12 years, with the national Dutch academic test score) and child intelligence ( approximately 6 and 13 years) were measured in a standardized manner. Also, a child genome-wide polygenic score of academic attainment was calculated. To estimate the effect of educational mobility, inverse probability-weighted linear models and Diagonal Reference Models (DRM) were used. RESULTS: Upward maternal educational mobility was associated with better offspring school achievement, higher intelligence, and more family routines if compared to offspring of mothers with no upward mobility. However, mothers did not implement the same level of family routines as similarly educated mothers and grandfathers who already had achieved this educational level. Likewise, children of mothers with upward educational mobility had lower school achievement and intelligence than children of similarly educated mothers with no mobility. Child's genetic potential for education followed a similar association pattern with higher potential in children of upward mobile mothers.

Grandparental socioeconomic status, which independently predicts child school achievement, intelligence, and parental family routines, should also be assessed.

       " Document(page_content=\"Digitization is often presented in policy discourse as a panacea to a multitude of contemporary problems, not least in healthcare. How can policy promises relating to digitization be assessed and potentially countered in particular local contexts? Based on a study in Denmark, we suggest scrutinizing the politics of digitization by comparing policy promises about the future with practitioners' experience in the present. While Denmark is one of the most digitalized countries in the world, digitization of pathology has only recently been given full policy attention. As pathology departments are faced with an increased demand for pathology analysis and a shortage of pathologists, Danish policymakers have put forward digitization as a way to address these challenges. Who is it that wants to digitize pathology, why, and how does digitization unfold in routine work practices? Using online search and document analysis, we identify actors and analyze the policy promises describing expectations associated with digitization. We then use interviews and observations to juxtapose these expectations with observations of everyday pathology practices as experienced by pathologists. We show that policymakers expect digitization to improve speed, patient safety, and diagnostic accuracy, as well as efficiency. In everyday practice, however, digitization does not deliver on these expectations. Fulfillment of policy expectations instead hinges on the types of artificial intelligence (AI) applications that are still to be developed and implemented. Some pathologists remark that AI might work in the easy cases, but this would leave them with only the difficult cases, which they consider too burdensome. Our particular mode of juxtaposing policy and practice throws new light on the political work done by policy promises and helps to explain why the discipline of pathology does not seem to easily lend itself to the digital embrace.\", metadata={'PMID': '38364720', 'TI': 'Speed, accuracy, and efficiency: The promises and practices of digitization in pathology.', 'FAU': 'Kusta, Olsi Bearman, Margaret Gorur, Radhika Risor, Torsten Brodersen, John Brandt Hoeyer, Klaus', 'AU': 'Kusta O Bearman M Gorur R Risor T Brodersen JB Hoeyer K', 'DP': Timestamp('2024-02-09 00:00:00'), 'MH': 'None', 'OT': 'None', 'PL': 'England', 'JT': 'Social science & medicine (1982)', 'PMC': 'None', 'EDAT': NaT, 'MHDA': NaT, 'STAT': 'Publisher'}),\n",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 257 patients who underwent CT were included in this Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved study. 463 fractured and 1883 non-fractured vertebral bodies were included, with 190 fractures unstable. Two readers identified vertebral body fractures and assessed their stability. A combination of a Hierarchical Convolutional Neural Network (hNet) and a fracture Classification Network (fNet) was used to build a neural network for the automated detection and stability analysis of vertebral body fractures on CT. Two final test settings were chosen: one with vertebral body levels C1/2 included and one where they were excluded. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 68 +/- 14 years. 140 patients were female. The network showed a slightly higher diagnostic performance when excluding C1/2. Accordingly, the network was able to distinguish fractured and non-fractured vertebral bodies with a sensitivity of 75.8 % and a specificity of 80.3 %. Additionally, the network determined the stability of the vertebral bodies with a sensitivity of 88.4 % and a specificity of 80.3 %. The AUC was 87 % and 91 % for fracture detection and stability analysis, respectively. The sensitivity of our network in indicating the presence of at least one fracture / one unstable fracture within the whole spine achieved values of 78.7 % and 97.2 %, respectively, when excluding C1/2.

Saliency methods are commonly used, yet there's a lack of quantitative evidence regarding their performance. OBJECTIVES: To quantitatively evaluate the performance of widely utilized saliency XAI methods in the task of breast cancer detection on mammograms. METHODS: Three radiologists drew ground-truth boxes on a balanced mammogram dataset of women (n = 1496 cancer-positive and negative scans) from three centers. A modified, pre-trained DL model was employed for breast cancer detection, using MLO and CC images. Saliency XAI methods, including Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), Grad-CAM++, and Eigen-CAM, were evaluated. We utilized the Pointing Game to assess these methods, determining if the maximum value of a saliency map aligned with the bounding boxes, representing the ratio of correctly identified lesions among all cancer patients, with a value ranging from 0 to 1. RESULTS: The development sample included 2,244 women (75%), with the remaining 748 women (25%) in the testing set for unbiased XAI evaluation. The model's recall, precision, accuracy, and F1-Score in identifying cancer in the testing set were 69%, 88%, 80%, and 0.77, respectively. The Pointing Game Scores for Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, and Eigen-CAM were 0.41, 0.30, and 0.35 in women with cancer and marginally increased to 0.41, 0.31, and 0.36 when considering only true-positive samples.

Our objective was to characterize the genotypes and phenotypes of PAFAH1B1-related epilepsy. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive analysis of the medical histories, magnetic resonance imaging findings, and video-electroencephalogram recordings of 11 patients with PAFAH1B1 variants at the Neurology Department of Beijing Children's Hospital from June 2017 to November 2022. RESULTS: The age of onset of epilepsy ranged from 2 months to 4 years, with a median onset age of 5 months. Among these 11 patients (comprising 6 boys and 5 girls), all were diagnosed with lissencephaly type 1. Predominantly, generalized tonic-clonic and spasm seizures characterized PAFAH1B1-related epilepsy. Additionally, 10 out of the 11 patients exhibited severe developmental disorders. All patients exhibited de novo variants, with three individuals displaying 17p13.3 deletions linked to haploinsufficiency of PAFAH1B1. Four variants were previously unreported. Notably, three patients with 17p13.3 deletions displayed developmental delay and drug resistant epilepsy, whereas the single patient with mild developmental delay, Intelligence Quotient (IQ) 57 and well-controlled seizures had a splicing-site variant. CONCLUSION: The severity of the phenotype in patients with PAFAH1B1 variants ranged from drug-responsive seizures to severe epileptic encephalopathy.

SETTING: We conducted a pilot study of the aDOT-CEI intervention, informed by the operant framework of Key Principles in Contingency Management Implementation, to improve ART adherence among YWH (18-29) in California and Florida who had an unsuppressed HIV viral load. METHODS: We recruited 28 virally unsuppressed YWH from AIDS Healthcare Foundation (AHF) clinics, who used the aDOT platform for 3 months. Study outcomes included feasibility and acceptability, self-reported ART adherence, and HIV viral load. RESULTS: Participants reported high satisfaction with the app (91%), and 82% said that it helped them take their medication. Comfort with the security and privacy of the app was moderate (55%), and 59% indicated the incentives helped improve daily adherence. CONCLUSION: Acceptability and feasibility of the aDOT-CEI intervention were high with potential to improve viral suppression, although some a priori metrics were not met.

Key aspects such as authenticity in academic writing are at stake with artificial intelligence (AI) generating highly linguistically accurate and grammatically sound texts. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to compare human-written with AI-generated scientific literature in orthopedics and sports medicine. METHODS: Five original abstracts were selected from the PubMed database. These abstracts were subsequently rewritten with the assistance of 2 LLMs with different degrees of proficiency. Subsequently, researchers with varying degrees of expertise and with different areas of specialization were asked to rank the abstracts according to linguistic and methodological parameters. Finally, researchers had to classify the articles as AI generated or human written. RESULTS: Neither the researchers nor the AI-detection software could successfully identify the AI-generated texts. Furthermore, the criteria previously suggested in the literature did not correlate with whether the researchers deemed a text to be AI generated or whether they judged the article correctly based on these parameters. CONCLUSIONS: The primary finding of this study was that researchers were unable to distinguish between LLM-generated and human-written texts.

Traditional ultrasound, commonly used for fatty liver screening, often lacks the ability to accurately quantify steatosis, leading to insufficient follow-up for patients with moderate-to-severe steatosis. Transient elastography (TE) provides a more quantitative diagnosis of steatosis and fibrosis, closely aligning with biopsy results. Moreover, machine learning (ML) technology holds promise for developing more precise diagnostic models for NAFLD using a variety of laboratory indicators. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop a novel ML-based diagnostic model leveraging TE results for staging hepatic steatosis. The objective was to streamline the model's input features, creating a cost-effective and user-friendly tool to distinguish patients with NAFLD requiring follow-up. This innovative approach merges TE and ML to enhance diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in NAFLD assessment. METHODS: The study involved a comprehensive analysis of health examination records from Suzhou Municipal Hospital, spanning from March to May 2023. Patient data and questionnaire responses were meticulously inputted into Microsoft Excel 2019, followed by thorough data cleaning and model development using Python 3.7, with libraries scikit-learn and numpy to ensure data accuracy. A cohort comprising 978 residents with complete medical records and TE results was included for analysis. Various classification models, including logistic regression (LR), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), were constructed and evaluated based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). RESULTS: Among the 916 patients included in the study, 273 were diagnosed with moderate-to-severe NAFLD. The concordance rate between traditional ultrasound and TE for detecting moderate-to-severe NAFLD was 84.6% (231/273).

OBJECTIVE: The applicability of a diet management system was evaluated using AI-based imaging to assess the sodium content of diets prescribed for hospitalized patients. METHODS: Based on the information on the already investigated nutrients and quantity of food, consumed sodium was analyzed through photographs obtained before and after a meal. We used a hybrid model that first leveraged the capabilities of the You Only Look Once, version 4 (YOLOv4) architecture for the detection of food and dish areas in images. Following this initial detection, 2 distinct approaches were adopted for further classification: a custom ResNet-101 model and a hyperspectral imaging-based technique. These methodologies focused on accurate classification and estimation of the food quantity and sodium amount, respectively. The 24-hour urine sodium (UNa) value was measured as a reference for evaluating the sodium intake. RESULTS: Results were analyzed using complete data from 25 participants out of the total 54 enrolled individuals. The median sodium intake calculated by the AI algorithm (AI-Na) was determined to be 2022.7 mg per day/person (adjusted by administered fluids). A significant correlation was observed between AI-Na and 24-hour UNa, while there was a notable disparity between them. A regression analysis, considering patient characteristics (eg, gender, age, renal function, the use of diuretics, and administered fluids) yielded a formula accounting for the interaction between AI-Na and 24-hour UNa. Consequently, it was concluded that AI-Na holds clinical significance in estimating salt intake for hospitalized patients using images without the need for 24-hour UNa measurements.

In cardiovascular imaging, biased AI models used in clinical practice can negatively affect patient outcomes. Biased AI models result from decisions made when training and evaluating a model. This paper is a comprehensive guide for AI development teams to understand assumptions in datasets and chosen metrics for outcome/ground truth, and how this translates to real-world performance for cardiovascular disease (CVD). RECENT FINDINGS: CVDs are the number one cause of mortality worldwide; however, the prevalence, burden, and outcomes of CVD vary across gender and race. Several biomarkers are also shown to vary among different populations and ethnic/racial groups. Inequalities in clinical trial inclusion, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment are preserved in health data that is ultimately used to train AI algorithms, leading to potential biases in model performance. Despite the notion that AI models themselves are biased, AI can also help to mitigate bias (e.g., bias auditing tools). In this review paper, we describe in detail implicit and explicit biases in the care of cardiovascular disease that may be present in existing datasets but are not obvious to model developers. We review disparities in CVD outcomes across different genders and race groups, differences in treatment of historically marginalized groups, and disparities in clinical trials for various cardiovascular diseases and outcomes.

       " Document(page_content='The long-term neurodevelopment of children born with oesophageal atresia (OA) is unclear. Therefore, we assessed the neurocognitive domains and their predictors. Patients born with OA between February 2006 and December 2014, who were routinely seen at eight years as part of a structured prospective longitudinal follow-up program, were included. Main outcome measures were need for school support, performance in various neurocognitive domains and potential predictors of neurocognitive problems. We analysed data of 65 children with a mean (SD) age of 8.1 (0.2) years, of whom 89% with OA type C. Thirty-five (54%) surgical corrections were minimally invasive; the median (interquartile range) duration of exposure to anaesthetics in the first 24 months was 398 (296 - 710) minutes. Forty-four (68%) attended regular education without extra support and intelligence was within normal range (99-108). More than 50% had z-scores </= -2 on one or more neurocognitive domains, of which attention was the most frequently affected domain. The speed on the sustained attention task was significantly below normal (z-score -1.48 (2.12), p < .001), as was fluctuation of sustained attention (z-score -3.19 (3.80), p < .001). The minimally invasive approach and a lower socio-economic status (both p = 0.006) proved significant predictors for sustained attention problems in multivariable analyses.  Conclusion: Children who undergo minimally invasive surgery for OA correction are at risk for sustained attention problems at school age. Future studies unravelling the effects of perioperative events on neurodevelopment should lead to optimal surgical, anaesthesiological, and intensive care management in the neonatal period. What is Known: * School-aged children born with oesophageal atresia have normal intelligence but problems with sustained attention at eight years.

       " Document(page_content=\"INTRODUCTION: Primary brain tumors are a common cause of morbidity and mortality in children and young people (CYP) globally. Impaired neurocognitive function is a potential severe consequence in primary brain tumor (PBT) survivors. There are no in-depth studies from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) to inform management and follow-up. The research questions of this study were as follows: Are the sociodemographic factors (lower age of CYP, female gender, low socioeconomic status, low parental education), disease-related factors (high grade of tumor, presence of seizures, presence of hydrocephalous), and treatment-related factors (adjuvant therapy, no surgical intervention, post-treatment seizures, placement of shunts) associated with decline in neurcognition outcomes 12 months post-treatment in CYP with PBTs? METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted from November 2020 to July 2023 at the Aga Khan University Hospital and Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, tertiary care hospitals in Karachi, Pakistan. All CYP aged 5 to 21 years with a newly diagnosed PBTs were eligible. The neurocognition assessment was undertaken by a psychologist at two points, i.e., pre-treatment and at 12 months post-treatment using validated tools. The verbal intelligence was assessed by Slosson Intelligence tool, revised 3rd edition (SIT-R3), perceptual reasoning by Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM), and the Processing Speed Index by Wechsler Intelligence Scale (WISC V) and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-IV). The data were analyzed by STATA version 12 software. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) was used to determine the factors associated with the mean change in 12 months post-treatment verbal and non-verbal neurocognition scores. Unadjusted and adjusted beta coefficients with their 95% confidence intervals were reported. RESULTS: A total of 48 CYPs with PBTs were enrolled, 23 (48%) of them were lost to follow-up and 10 (21%) died. The remaining 25 (52%) were reassessed 12 months after treatment. On multivariable analysis, a significant decline in verbal intelligence scores at 12 months was predicted by post-treatment seizures beta =  - 20.8 (95% CI, - 38.2, - 3.4), mothers having no formal educational status and lower household monthly income. Similarly, a significant decline in perceptual reasoning scores was also predicted by post-treatment seizures beta =  - 10.7 (95% CI, - 20.6, - 0.8), mothers having no formal education and having lower household monthly income. Worsening of processing speed scores at 12 months post-treatment were predicted by tumor histology, post-treatment seizures beta =  - 33.9 (95% CI, - 47.7, - 20.0), lower educational status of the mother, and having lower household monthly. However, an improvement was seen in processing speed scores after surgical tumor resection. CONCLUSION: In this novel study, the post-treatment mean change in verbal and non-verbal neurocognition scores was associated with sociodemographic, tumor, and treatment factors. These findings may have potential implications for targeted early psychological screening of higher risk CYP with PBTs. Identification of these predictors may serve as a foundation for developing more cost-effective treatment thereby alleviating the burden of neurocognitive morbidity.

       " Document(page_content='Melanoma is the leading cause of skin cancer-related death. As prognosis of patients with melanoma remains problematic, identification of new therapeutic targets remains essential. Matricellular proteins are nonstructural extracellular matrix proteins. They are secreted into the tumor microenvironment to coordinate behavior among different cell types, yet their contribution to melanoma is underinvestigated. Examples of matricellular proteins include those comprising the CCN family. The CCN family member, CCN1, is highly proangiogenic. Herein, we show that, in human patients with melanoma, although found in several tumor cell types, CCN1 is highly expressed by a subset of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) in patients with melanoma and this expression correlates positively with expression of proangiogenic genes and progressive disease/resistance to anti-PD1 checkpoint inhibitors. Consistent with these observations, in a syngeneic C57BL6 mouse model of melanoma, loss of CCN1 expression from Col1A2-Cre-, herein identified as \"universal,\" fibroblasts, impaired metastasis of subcutaneously injected B16F10 tumor cells to lung, concomitant with disrupted neovascularization and collagen organization. Disruption of the extracellular matrix in the loss of CCN1 was validated using a novel artificial intelligence-based image analysis platform that revealed significantly decreased phenotypic fibrosis and composite morphometric collagen scores. As drug resistance is linked to matrix deposition and neoangiogenesis, these data suggest that CCN1, due to its multifaceted role, may represent a novel therapeutic target for drug-resistant melanoma. Our data further emphasize the essential role that cancer-associated, (universal) Col1A2-Cre-fibroblasts and extracellular matrix remodeling play in coordinating behavior among different cell types within the tumor microenvironment. SIGNIFICANCE: In human patients, the expression of proangiogenic matricellular protein CCN1 in CAFs correlates positively with expression of stroma and angiogenic markers and progressive disease/resistance to checkpoint inhibitor therapy. In an animal model, loss of CCN1 from CAFs impaired metastasis of melanoma cells, neovascularization, and collagen deposition, emphasizing that CAFs coordinate cellular behavior in a tumor microenvironment and that CCN1 may be a novel target.', metadata={'PMID': '38363129', 'TI': 'Cancer-associated Fibroblast-specific Expression of the Matricellular Protein CCN1 Coordinates Neovascularization and Stroma Deposition in Melanoma Metastasis.', 'FAU': 'Hutchenreuther, James Nguyen, John Quesnel, Katherine Vincent, Krista M Petitjean, Louis Bourgeois, Sophia Boyd, Mark Bou-Gharios, George Postovit, Lynne-Marie Leask, Andrew', 'AU': 'Hutchenreuther J Nguyen J Quesnel K Vincent KM Petitjean L Bourgeois S Boyd M Bou-Gharios G Postovit LM Leask A', 'DP': Timestamp('2024-02-27 00:00:00'), 'MH': 'Animals Humans Mice Artificial Intelligence *Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts/metabolism Collagen Cysteine-Rich Protein 61/genetics *Melanoma/genetics Neovascularization, Pathologic/genetics Tumor Microenvironment/genetics', 'OT': 'None', 'PL': 'United States', 'JT': 'Cancer research communications', 'PMC': 'PMC10898341', 'EDAT': NaT, 'MHDA': NaT, 'STAT': 'MEDLINE'}),\n",

Initially collected for clinical radiation therapy (RT) treatment planning, this dataset has been retrospectively reconstructed for use in imaging research. ACQUISITION AND VALIDATION METHODS: RADCURE encompasses data from 3346 patients, featuring computed tomography (CT) RT simulation images with corresponding target and organ-at-risk contours. These CT scans were collected using systems from three different manufacturers. Standard clinical imaging protocols were followed, and contours were manually generated and reviewed at weekly RT quality assurance rounds. RADCURE imaging and structure set data was extracted from our institution's radiation treatment planning and oncology information systems using a custom-built data mining and processing system. Furthermore, images were linked to our clinical anthology of outcomes data for each patient and includes demographic, clinical and treatment information based on the 7th edition TNM staging system (Tumor-Node-Metastasis Classification System of Malignant Tumors). The median patient age is 63, with the final dataset including 80% males. Half of the cohort is diagnosed with oropharyngeal cancer, while laryngeal, nasopharyngeal, and hypopharyngeal cancers account for 25%, 12%, and 5% of cases, respectively. The median duration of follow-up is five years, with 60% of the cohort surviving until the last follow-up point. DATA FORMAT AND USAGE NOTES: The dataset provides images and contours in DICOM CT and RT-STRUCT formats, respectively. We have standardized the nomenclature for individual contours-such as the gross primary tumor, gross nodal volumes, and 19 organs-at-risk-to enhance the RT-STRUCT files' utility. Accompanying demographic, clinical, and treatment data are supplied in a comma-separated values (CSV) file format. This comprehensive dataset is publicly accessible via The Cancer Imaging Archive. POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS: RADCURE's amalgamation of imaging, clinical, demographic, and treatment data renders it an invaluable resource for a broad spectrum of radiomics image analysis research endeavors.

However, little is known about their generalizability across European screening settings. We therefore investigated the discriminatory performances of an AI-based risk model in European screening settings. METHODS: Using four European screening populations in three countries (Italy, Spain, Germany) screened between 2009 and 2020 for women aged 45-69, we performed a nested case-control study to assess the predictive performance of an AI-based risk model. In total, 739 women with incident breast cancers were included together with 7812 controls matched on year of study-entry. Mammographic features (density, microcalcifications, masses, left-right breast asymmetries of these features) were extracted using AI from negative digital mammograms at study-entry. Two-year absolute risks of breast cancer were predicted and assessed after two years of follow-up. Adjusted risk stratification performance metrics were reported per clinical guidelines. FINDINGS: The overall adjusted Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve (aAUC) of the AI risk model was 0.72 (95% CI 0.70-0.75) for breast cancers developed in four screening populations. In the 6.2% [529/8551] of women at high risk using the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines thresholds, cancers were more likely diagnosed after 2 years follow-up, risk-ratio (RR) 6.7 (95% CI 5.6-8.0), compared with the 69% [5907/8551] of women classified at general risk by the model. Similar risk-ratios were observed across levels of mammographic density. INTERPRETATION: The AI risk model showed generalizable discriminatory performances across European populations and, predicted  approximately 30% of clinically relevant stage 2 and higher breast cancers in  approximately 6% of high-risk women who were sent home with a negative mammogram.

The appetite for AI in science, specifically healthcare is huge. It is imperative to understand the credibility of large language models in assisting the public in medical queries. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the ability of ChatGPT to provide reasonably accurate answers to public queries within the domain of Otolaryngology. METHODS: Two board-certified otolaryngologists (HZ, RS) inputted 30 text-based patient queries into the ChatGPT-3.5 model. ChatGPT responses were rated by physicians on a scale (accurate, partially accurate, incorrect), while a similar 3-point scale involving confidence was given to layperson reviewers. Demographic data involving gender and education level was recorded for the public reviewers. Inter-rater agreement percentage was based on binomial distribution for calculating the 95% confidence intervals and performing significance tests. Statistical significance was defined as p < .05 for two-sided tests. RESULTS: In testing patient queries, both Otolaryngology physicians found that ChatGPT answered 98.3% of questions correctly, but only 79.8% (range 51.7%-100%) of patients were confident that the AI model was accurate in its responses (corrected agreement = 0.682; p < .001).

These systems can be countered by deploying obscurants like smoke, dust, or fog to hinder visibility and communication. However, these counter-systems affect the visibility of both sides of the cloud. In this sense, this manuscript introduces a new concept of a smoke cloud composed of engineered Janus particles to conceal the target image on one side while providing clear vision from the other. The proposed method exploits the unique scattering properties of Janus particles, which selectively interact with photons from different directions to open up the possibility of asymmetric imaging. This approach employs a model that combines a genetic algorithm with Discrete Dipole Approximation to optimize the Janus particles' geometrical parameters for the desired scattering properties. Moreover, we propose a Monte Carlo-based approach to calculate the image formed as photons pass through the cloud, considering highly asymmetric particles, such as Janus particles. The effectiveness of the cloud in disguising a target is evaluated by calculating the Probability of Detection (PD) and the Probability of Identification (PID) based on the constructed image. The optimized Janus particles can produce a cloud where it is possible to identify a target more than 50% of the time from one side (PID > 50%) while the target is not detected more than 50% of the time from the other side (PD < 50%).

       " Document(page_content='Objective: To characterize neurocognitive response to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion during a multiday external lumbar drainage (ELD) trial in patients with suspected normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). Methods: Inpatients (N = 70) undergoing an ELD trial as part of NPH evaluation participated. Cognition and balance were assessed using standardized measures before and after a three-day ELD trial. Cognitive change pre- to post-ELD trial was assessed in relation to change in balance, baseline neuroimaging findings, NPH symptoms, demographics, and other disease-relevant clinical parameters. Results: Multiday ELD resulted in significant cognitive improvement (particularly on measures of memory and language). This improvement was independent of demographics, test-retest interval, number of medical and psychiatric comorbidities, NPH symptom duration, estimated premorbid intelligence, baseline level of cognitive impairment, cerebrovascular disease burden, degree of ventriculomegaly, or other NPH-related morphological brain alterations. Balance scores evidenced a greater magnitude of improvement than cognitive scores and were weakly, but positively correlated with cognitive change scores. Conclusions: Findings suggest that cognitive improvement associated with a multiday ELD trial can be sufficiently captured with bedside neurocognitive testing. These findings support the utility of neuropsychological consultation, along with balance assessment, in informing clinical decision-making regarding responsiveness to temporary CSF diversion for patients undergoing elective NPH evaluation.

This study aimed to predict the recurrence of AF after catheter ablation by using artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled pre-ablation computed tomography (PVCT) images and pre-ablation clinical data. METHODS: A total of 638 drug-refractory paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) patients undergone ablation were recruited. For model training, we used left atria (LA) acquired from pre-ablation PVCT slices (126,288 images). A total of 29 clinical variables were collected before ablation, including baseline characteristics, medical histories, laboratory results, transthoracic echocardiographic parameters, and 3D reconstructed LA volumes. The I-Score was applied to select variables for model training. For the prediction of one-year AF recurrence, PVCT deep-learning and clinical variable machine-learning models were developed. We then applied machine learning to ensemble the PVCT and clinical variable models. RESULTS: The PVCT model achieved an AUC of 0.63 in the test set. Various combinations of clinical variables selected by I-Score can yield an AUC of 0.72, which is significantly better than all variables or features selected by nonparametric statistics (AUCs of 0.66 to 0.69). The ensemble model (PVCT images and clinical variables) significantly improved predictive performance up to an AUC of 0.76 (sensitivity of 86.7% and specificity of 51.0%).

However, these algorithms are typically evaluated using figures of merit (FoMs) that are not explicitly designed to correlate with clinical task performance. Such FoMs include the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), the Jaccard similarity coefficient (JSC), and the Hausdorff distance (HD). The objective of this study was to investigate whether evaluating PET segmentation algorithms using these task-agnostic FoMs yields interpretations consistent with evaluation on clinically relevant quantitative tasks. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study to assess the concordance in the evaluation of segmentation algorithms using the DSC, JSC, and HD and on the tasks of estimating the metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) of primary tumors from PET images of patients with non-small cell lung cancer. The PET images were collected from the American College of Radiology Imaging Network 6668/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 0235 multicenter clinical trial data. The study was conducted in 2 contexts: (1) evaluating conventional segmentation algorithms, namely those based on thresholding (SUV(max)40% and SUV(max)50%), boundary detection (Snakes), and stochastic modeling (Markov random field-Gaussian mixture model); (2) evaluating the impact of network depth and loss function on the performance of a state-of-the-art U-net-based segmentation algorithm. Results: Evaluation of conventional segmentation algorithms based on the DSC, JSC, and HD showed that SUV(max)40% significantly outperformed SUV(max)50%. However, SUV(max)40% yielded lower accuracy on the tasks of estimating MTV and TLG, with a 51% and 54% increase, respectively, in the ensemble normalized bias. Similarly, the Markov random field-Gaussian mixture model significantly outperformed Snakes on the basis of the task-agnostic FoMs but yielded a 24% increased bias in estimated MTV. For the U-net-based algorithm, our evaluation showed that although the network depth did not significantly alter the DSC, JSC, and HD values, a deeper network yielded substantially higher accuracy in the estimated MTV and TLG, with a decreased bias of 91% and 87%, respectively. Additionally, whereas there was no significant difference in the DSC, JSC, and HD values for different loss functions, up to a 73% and 58% difference in the bias of the estimated MTV and TLG, respectively, existed.

The continuous adoption of the emerging Generative AI technologies will help startups gain more and more experience with adoptions, helping them to leverage continuously evolving technological innovation landscape. However, there is a dearth of prior research on ChatGPT adoption in the startup context, especially from Entrepreneur perspective, highlights the urgent need for a thorough investigation to identify the variables influencing this technological adoption. The primary objective of this study is to ascertain the factors that impact the uptake of ChatGPT technology by startups, anticipate their influence on the triumph of companies, and offer pragmatic suggestions for various stakeholders, including entrepreneurs, and policymakers. METHOD AND ANALYSIS: This study attempts to explore the variables impacting startups' adoption of ChatGPT technology, with an emphasis on comprehending entrepreneurs' attitudes and perspectives. To identify and then empirically validate the Generative AI technology adoption framework, the study uses a two-stage methodology that includes experience-based research, and survey research. The research method design is descriptive and Correlational design. Stage one of the research study is descriptive and involves adding practical insights, and real-world context to the model by drawing from the professional consulting experiences of the researchers with the SMEs. The outcome of this stage is the adoption model (also called as research framework), building Upon Technology Adoption Model (TAM), that highlight the technology adoption factors (also called as latent variables) connected with subset of each other and finally to the technology adoption factor (or otherwise). Further, the latent variables and their relationships with other latent variables as graphically highlighted by the adoption model will be translated into the structured questionnaire. Stage two involves survey based research. In this stage, structured questionnaire is tested with small group of entrepreneurs (who has provided informed consent) and finally to be distributed among startup founders to further validate the relationships between these factors and the level of influence individual factors have on overall technology adoption.

       " Document(page_content='BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Autoimmune encephalitis (AE) is a rare neuroinflammatory disease affecting the central nervous system. To examine language functions in patients with different subsets of AE consisting of seropositive and seronegative groups. METHODS: Fifty-two patients were recruited from neurology departments in Melbourne, Australia, who met clinical criteria for possible AE. Language tests include the Naming Test from the Sydney Language Battery (SydBat), the semantic fluency trial from the Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT), and the Vocabulary and Similarities subtests of the Weschler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence-Second Edition. The results were standardised with normative data. RESULTS: The mean age of our cohort was 52.5 years old, with the average time from hospital admission to recruitment being 38.41 months. At an aggregate level, none of the mean language test z-scores were below normative data. At the patient level, impairment rates were 18.37% for COWAT (animals), 28.57% for SydBat (naming), 4.65% for Similarities, and 4.55% for Vocabulary. Chi-squared goodness of fit tests indicated that observed performances were significantly below expected performances for the SydBat (naming) test (p < 0.0001) and COWAT (animals) (p = 0.004). DISCUSSION: While, on average, language functions were within normal limits in patients with AE, but a subgroup exhibited lower performance in semantic fluency and visual confrontation naming, with impairment rates below expected norms. To advance understanding of language in chronic AE patients, exploring the impact of seizure burden, antiseizure medication use, and the relationship of language functions with other cognitive functions is crucial.', metadata={'PMID': '38358549', 'TI': 'Language impairments in seropositive and seronegative autoimmune encephalitis.', 'FAU': \"Griffith, Sarah P Wesselingh, Robb D'Aprano, Fiore Seery, Nabil Rushen, Tiffany Kyndt, Chris Long, Brian Seneviratne, Udaya Kalincik, Tomas Buzzard, Katherine Butzkueven, Helmut O'Brien, Terence J Alpitsis, Rubina Malpas, Charles B Monif, Mastura\", 'AU': \"Griffith SP Wesselingh R D'Aprano F Seery N Rushen T Kyndt C Long B Seneviratne U Kalincik T Buzzard K Butzkueven H O'Brien TJ Alpitsis R Malpas CB Monif M\", 'DP': Timestamp('2024-02-15 00:00:00'), 'MH': 'None', 'OT': 'Autoimmune encephalitis Cognition Language Neuroimmunology Neuropsychology', 'PL': 'Italy', 'JT': 'Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology', 'PMC': 'None', 'EDAT': NaT, 'MHDA': NaT, 'STAT': 'Publisher'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition that primarily affects brain tissue. Because the retina and brain share the same embryonic origin, visual deficits have been reported in AD patients. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has recently received a lot of attention due to its immense power to process and detect image hallmarks and make clinical decisions (like diagnosis) based on images. Since retinal changes have been reported in AD patients, AI is being proposed to process images to predict, diagnose, and prognosis AD. As a result, the purpose of this review was to discuss the use of AI trained on retinal images of AD patients. According to previous research, AD patients experience retinal thickness and retinal vessel density changes, which can occasionally occur before the onset of the disease's clinical symptoms. AI and machine vision can detect and use these changes in the domains of disease prediction, diagnosis, and prognosis. As a result, not only have unique algorithms been developed for this condition, but also databases such as the Retinal OCTA Segmentation dataset (ROSE) have been constructed for this purpose. The achievement of high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in the classification of retinal images between AD and healthy groups is one of the major breakthroughs in using AI based on retinal images for AD. It is fascinating that researchers could pinpoint individuals with a positive family history of AD based on the properties of their eyes. In conclusion, the growing application of AI in medicine promises its future position in processing different aspects of patients with AD, but we need cohort studies to determine whether it can help to follow up with healthy persons at risk of AD for a quicker diagnosis or assess the prognosis of patients with AD.\", metadata={'PMID': '38358524', 'TI': \"Retinal imaging and Alzheimer's disease: a future powered by Artificial Intelligence.\", 'FAU': 'Ashayeri, Hamidreza Jafarizadeh, Ali Yousefi, Milad Farhadi, Fereshteh Javadzadeh, Alireza', 'AU': 'Ashayeri H Jafarizadeh A Yousefi M Farhadi F Javadzadeh A', 'DP': Timestamp('2024-02-15 00:00:00'), 'MH': 'None', 'OT': \"Alzheimer's disease Artificial intelligence Deep learning Machine learning Retina Retinal images Review\", 'PL': 'Germany', 'JT': \"Graefe's archive for clinical and experimental ophthalmology = Albrecht von Graefes Archiv fur klinische und experimentelle Ophthalmologie\", 'PMC': 'None', 'EDAT': NaT, 'MHDA': NaT, 'STAT': 'Publisher'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='BACKGROUND: The study compared the readability, grade level, understandability, actionability, and accuracy of standard patient educational material against artificial intelligence chatbot-derived patient educational material regarding cirrhosis. METHODS: An identical standardized phrase was used to generate patient educational materials on cirrhosis from 4 large language model-derived chatbots (ChatGPT, DocsGPT, Google Bard, and Bing Chat), and the outputs were compared against a pre-existing human-derived educational material (Epic). Objective scores for readability and grade level were determined using Flesch-Kincaid and Simple Measure of Gobbledygook scoring systems. 14 patients/caregivers and 8 transplant hepatologists were blinded and independently scored the materials on understandability and actionability and indicated whether they believed the material was human or artificial intelligence-generated. Understandability and actionability were determined using the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool for Printable Materials. Transplant hepatologists also provided medical accuracy scores. RESULTS: Most educational materials scored similarly in readability and grade level but were above the desired sixth-grade reading level. All educational materials were deemed understandable by both groups, while only the human-derived educational material (Epic) was considered actionable by both groups. No significant difference in perceived actionability or understandability among the educational materials was identified. Both groups poorly identified which materials were human-derived versus artificial intelligence-derived. CONCLUSIONS: Chatbot-derived patient educational materials have comparable readability, grade level, understandability, and accuracy to human-derived materials. Readability, grade level, and actionability may be appropriate targets for improvement across educational materials on cirrhosis.

The sensor exhibits excellent response value (95% @1 ppm ethanol), extremely low detection limit (0.3 ppm), fast response/recovery time (16/13 s), and remarkable long-term stability for trace detection of ethanol gas at room temperature, attributed to the p-n heterojunction formed by CuO and TiO(2), as well as the rich functional groups and large specific surface area of MXene. Furthermore, a high-performance triboelectric nanogenerator (SMS-TENG) was developed through the introduction of the silicone/Mxene@silicone dual dielectric layer as the triboelectric layer, which improves the charge storage capacity of the dielectric layer and greatly enhances the output performance of the TENG. At the optimal doping ratio, the open-circuit voltage of the SMS-TENG can reach 1160 V, which is sufficient to light 720 LEDs. By combining the sensor and SMS-TENG, the resistive response of ethanol sensing is converted to a voltage response, which amplifies the response value up to 15.8 times. Finally, the designed SMS-TENGs are expected to be arrayed on an inspection robot as energy supply and combined with the CuO/TiO(2)/Mxene ethanol sensor to build a self-powered ethanol detection alarm system, endowing the inspection robot with the capability of self-powered ethanol detection at ppb level.

Data were collected through the hard copies of the questionnaires, compiled using Microsoft Excel and analyzed using SPSS version 26. P < 0.5 was considered significant. The scores of EI and resilience were compared to evaluate the relationship between them. RESULTS: A correlation analysis was performed between EI and resilience by comparing the scores obtained from SSEIT and CD-RISC.

       " Document(page_content=\"INTRODUCTION: Predictive models have been used to aid early diagnosis of PCOS, though existing models are based on small sample sizes and limited to fertility clinic populations. We built a predictive model using machine learning algorithms based on an outpatient population at risk for PCOS to predict risk and facilitate earlier diagnosis, particularly among those who meet diagnostic criteria but have not received a diagnosis. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study from a SafetyNet hospital's electronic health records (EHR) from 2003-2016. The study population included 30,601 women aged 18-45 years without concurrent endocrinopathy who had any visit to Boston Medical Center for primary care, obstetrics and gynecology, endocrinology, family medicine, or general internal medicine. Four prediction outcomes were assessed for PCOS. The first outcome was PCOS ICD-9 diagnosis with additional model outcomes of algorithm-defined PCOS. The latter was based on Rotterdam criteria and merging laboratory values, radiographic imaging, and ICD data from the EHR to define irregular menstruation, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovarian morphology on ultrasound. RESULTS: We developed predictive models using four machine learning methods: logistic regression, supported vector machine, gradient boosted trees, and random forests. Hormone values (follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, estradiol, and sex hormone binding globulin) were combined to create a multilayer perceptron score using a neural network classifier. Prediction of PCOS prior to clinical diagnosis in an out-of-sample test set of patients achieved an average AUC of 85%, 81%, 80%, and 82%, respectively in Models I, II, III and IV. Significant positive predictors of PCOS diagnosis across models included hormone levels and obesity; negative predictors included gravidity and positive bHCG. CONCLUSION: Machine learning algorithms were used to predict PCOS based on a large at-risk population. This approach may guide early detection of PCOS within EHR-interfaced populations to facilitate counseling and interventions that may reduce long-term health consequences. Our model illustrates the potential benefits of an artificial intelligence-enabled provider assistance tool that can be integrated into the EHR to reduce delays in diagnosis. However, model validation in other hospital-based populations is necessary.\", metadata={'PMID': '38356959', 'TI': 'Predicting polycystic ovary syndrome with machine learning algorithms from electronic health records.', 'FAU': 'Zad, Zahra Jiang, Victoria S Wolf, Amber T Wang, Taiyao Cheng, J Jojo Paschalidis, Ioannis Ch Mahalingaiah, Shruthi', 'AU': 'Zad Z Jiang VS Wolf AT Wang T Cheng JJ Paschalidis IC Mahalingaiah S', 'DP': NaT, 'MH': 'Humans Female *Polycystic Ovary Syndrome/diagnosis Retrospective Studies Artificial Intelligence Electronic Health Records Luteinizing Hormone Algorithms Machine Learning', 'OT': 'artificial intelligence disease prediction machine learning polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) predictive model', 'PL': 'Switzerland', 'JT': 'Frontiers in endocrinology', 'PMC': 'PMC10866556', 'EDAT': NaT, 'MHDA': NaT, 'STAT': 'MEDLINE'}),\n",

Due to the overlap of morphological features, it is difficult to distinguish clinically between preinvasive lesions (in situ adenocarcinoma, AIS) and invasive lesions (minimally invasive adenocarcinoma, MIA), which appear as ground glass cloudy nodules. This study was performed to probe the application value of artificial intelligence (AI)-based dual source CT scanning in the differentiation of AIS as well as MIA. METHODS: The clinical data of 136 patients in Shanghai Baoshan Hospital of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine from January 2019 to January 2022 were retrospectively analyzed. The accuracy of AI in distinguishing lung AIS (n=76) and MIA (n=60) were analyzed. The effectiveness of AI in detecting nodules and its diagnostic efficacy for AIS and MIA were explored. RESULTS: The proportion of patients with clear and regular lesion boundaries in AIS was higher than that in MIA. The mean lesion diameter of AIS patients was shorter than MIA patients. There was no difference in the CT value between AIS and MIA in the ground glass nodule density area of pure ground glass nodule and mixed ground glass nodule, but the CT value of the solid nodule density area in AIS was lower. The occurrence of pulmonary vascular abnormality, air bronchogram sign, and pleural depression in AIS patients were lower than MIA patients. The detection rate of AI for lung adenocarcinoma with nodule diameter </= 5 mm, complete solid nodules and ground glass nodules was significantly higher than radiologists.

Continual learning (CL) is aimed toward addressing this challenge. However, there still exists a gap between CL and human learning. In particular, humans are able to continually learn from the samples associated with known or unknown labels in their daily lives, whereas existing CL and semi-supervised CL (SSCL) methods assume that the training samples are associated with known labels. Specifically, we are interested in two questions: 1) how to utilize unrelated unlabeled data for the SSCL task and 2) how unlabeled data affect learning and catastrophic forgetting in the CL task. To explore these issues, we formulate a new SSCL method, which can be generically applied to existing CL models. Furthermore, we propose a novel gradient learner to learn from labeled data to predict gradients on unlabeled data. In this way, the unlabeled data can fit into the supervised CL framework. We extensively evaluate the proposed method on mainstream CL methods, adversarial CL (ACL), and semi-supervised learning (SSL) tasks. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on classification accuracy and backward transfer (BWT) in the CL setting while achieving the desired performance on classification accuracy in the SSL setting.

With the help of modern neuroimaging techniques, there has been significant progress made in brain disorder analysis. There is an increasing interest about utilizing artificial intelligence techniques to improve the efficiency of disorder diagnosis in recent years. However, these methods rely only on neuroimaging data for disorder diagnosis and do not explore the pathogenic mechanism behind the disorder or provide an interpretable result toward the diagnosis decision. Furthermore, the scarcity of medical data limits the performance of existing methods. As the hot application of graph neural networks (GNNs) in molecular graphs and drug discovery due to its strong graph-structured data learning ability, whether GNNs can also play a huge role in the field of brain disorder analysis. Thus, in this work, we innovatively model brain neuroimaging data into graph-structured data and propose knowledge distillation (KD) guided brain subgraph neural networks to extract discriminative subgraphs between patient and healthy brain graphs to explain which brain regions and abnormal functional connectivities cause the disorder. Specifically, we introduce the KD technique to transfer the knowledge of pretrained teacher model to guide brain subgraph neural networks training and alleviate the problem of insufficient training data. And these discriminative subgraphs are conducive to learn better brain graph-level representations for disorder prediction. We conduct abundant experiments on two functional magnetic resonance imaging datasets, i.e., Parkinson's disease (PD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and experimental results well demonstrate the superiority of our method over other brain graph analysis methods for disorder prediction accuracy.

Herein, a simple, low-cost, and efficient laser-induced forming process is proposed for the first time to prepare a skin-like flexible piezoresistive sensor. In the laser-induced forming process, based on the photothermal effect of graphene and the foaming effect of glucose, a skin-like polydimethylsiloxanes (PDMS) film with porous structures and surface protrusions is obtained by using infrared laser irradiation of the glucose/graphene/PDMS prepolymer film. Further, based on the skin-like PDMS film with a graphene conductive layer, a new skin-like flexible piezoresistive sensor is obtained. Due to the stress concentration caused by the surface protrusions and the low stiffness caused by the porous structures, the flexible piezoresistive sensor realizes an ultrahigh sensitivity of 1348 kPa(-1) at 0-2 kPa, a wide range of 200 kPa, a fast response/recovery time of 52 ms/35 ms, and good stability over 5000 cycles.

We investigated the role of artificial intelligence in PET/SPECT-guided approaches for immunotherapy-treated patients. METHODS: We performed a scoping review of MEDLINE, CENTRAL, and Embase databases using key terms related to immunotherapy, PET/SPECT imaging, and AI/radiomics through October 12, 2022. RESULTS: Of the 217 studies identified in our literature search, 24 relevant articles were selected. The median (interquartile range) sample size of included patient cohorts was 63 (157). Primary tumors of interest were lung (n = 14/24, 58.3%), lymphoma (n = 4/24, 16.7%), or melanoma (n = 4/24, 16.7%). A total of 28 treatment regimens were employed, including anti-PD-(L)1 (n = 13/28, 46.4%) and anti-CTLA-4 (n = 4/28, 14.3%) monoclonal antibodies. Predictive models were built from imaging features using univariate radiomics (n = 7/24, 29.2%), radiomics (n = 12/24, 50.0%), or deep learning (n = 5/24, 20.8%) and were most often used to prognosticate (n = 6/24, 25.0%) or describe tumor phenotype (n = 5/24, 20.8%). Eighteen studies (75.0%) performed AI model validation. CONCLUSION: Preliminary results suggest broad potential for the application of AI-guided immunotherapy management after further validation of models on large, prospective, multicenter cohorts. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: This scoping review describes how artificial intelligence models are built to make predictions based on medical imaging and explores their application specifically in the PET and SPECT examination of immunotherapy-treated cancers. KEY POINTS: * Immunotherapy has drastically altered the cancer treatment landscape but is known to precipitate response patterns that are not accurately accounted for by traditional imaging methods. * There is an unmet need for better tools to not only facilitate in-treatment evaluation but also to predict, a priori, which patients are likely to achieve a good response with a certain treatment as well as those who are likely to develop side effects. * Artificial intelligence applied to PET/SPECT imaging of immunotherapy-treated patients is mainly used to make predictions about prognosis or tumor phenotype and is built from baseline, pre-treatment images. Further testing is required before a true transition to clinical application can be realized.', metadata={'PMID': '38355986', 'TI': 'Artificial intelligence in immunotherapy PET/SPECT imaging.', 'FAU': 'McGale, Jeremy P Chen, Delphine L Trebeschi, Stefano Farwell, Michael D Wu, Anna M Cutler, Cathy S Schwartz, Lawrence H Dercle, Laurent', 'AU': 'McGale JP Chen DL Trebeschi S Farwell MD Wu AM Cutler CS Schwartz LH Dercle L', 'DP': Timestamp('2024-02-15 00:00:00'), 'MH': 'None', 'OT': 'Artificial intelligence Immunotherapy Positron emission tomography Single-photon emission computed tomography', 'PL': 'Germany', 'JT': 'European radiology', 'PMC': 'None', 'EDAT': NaT, 'MHDA': NaT, 'STAT': 'Publisher'}),\n",

The early stages of CKD sometimes present without visible symptoms, causing patients to be unaware. Early detection and treatments are critical in reducing complications and improving the overall quality of life for people afflicted. In this work, we investigate the use of an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)-based strategy, leveraging clinical characteristics, to predict CKD. This study collected clinical data from 491 patients, comprising 56 with CKD and 435 without CKD, encompassing clinical, laboratory, and demographic variables. To develop the predictive model, five machine learning (ML) methods, namely logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), Naive Bayes (NB), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), were employed. The optimal model was selected based on accuracy and area under the curve (AUC). Additionally, the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) algorithms were utilized to demonstrate the influence of the features on the optimal model. Among the five models developed, the XGBoost model achieved the best performance with an AUC of 0.9689 and an accuracy of 93.29%. The analysis of feature importance revealed that creatinine, glycosylated hemoglobin type A1C (HgbA1C), and age were the three most influential features in the XGBoost model. The SHAP force analysis further illustrated the model's visualization of individualized CKD predictions. For further insights into individual predictions, we also utilized the LIME algorithm. This study presents an interpretable ML-based approach for the early prediction of CKD.

A range of musculoskeletal disorders are discussed using a clinical-based approach, including trauma, bone age estimation, osteoarthritis, bone and soft-tissue tumors, and orthopedic implant-related pathology. Several AI algorithms have been applied to fracture detection and classification, which are potentially helpful tools for radiologists and clinicians. In bone age assessment, AI methods have been applied to assist radiologists by automatizing workflow, thus reducing workload and inter-observer variability. AI may potentially aid radiologists in identifying and grading abnormal findings of osteoarthritis as well as predicting the onset or progression of this disease. Either alone or combined with radiomics, AI algorithms may potentially improve diagnosis and outcome prediction of bone and soft-tissue tumors. Finally, information regarding appropriate positioning of orthopedic implants and related complications may be obtained using AI algorithms. In conclusion, rather than replacing radiologists, the use of AI should instead help them to optimize workflow, augment diagnostic performance, and keep up with ever-increasing workload.Relevance statement This narrative review provides an overview of AI applications in musculoskeletal imaging.

This group of conditions includes viral, bacterial, fungal and parasitic diseases, both common and rare presentations which, in aggregate, may account for a significant portion of the global visual burden. Diagnosis is frequently challenging even in specialist centres, and many disease presentations are highly regional. In an age of globalisation, an understanding of the various modes of transmission and the geographic distribution of infections can be instructive to clinicians. The impact of eye infections on global disability is currently not sufficiently captured in global prevalence studies on visual impairment and blindness, which focus on bilateral disease in the over-50s. Moreover, in many cases it is hard to differentiate between infectious and immune-mediated diseases. Since infectious eye diseases can be preventable and frequently affect younger people, we argue that in future prevalence studies they should be considered as a separate category, including estimates of disability-adjusted life years (DALY) as a measure of overall disease burden. Numbers of ocular infections are uniquely affected by outbreaks as well as endemic transmission, and their control frequently relies on collaborative partnerships that go well beyond the remit of ophthalmology, encompassing domains as various as vaccination, antibiotic development, individual healthcare, vector control, mass drug administration, food supplementation, environmental and food hygiene, epidemiological mapping, and many more. Moreover, the anticipated impacts of global warming, conflict, food poverty, urbanisation and environmental degradation are likely to magnify their importance.

In this project we brought together research on intelligence mindset with research on implicit social cognition. Harnessing recent innovations from research on implicit measures, we assessed intelligence mindsets on an implicit level with a mousetracking Propositional Evaluation Paradigm. This measure captures the spontaneous truth evaluation of growth- and fixed-mindset statements to tap into implicit beliefs.

       " Document(page_content=\"BACKGROUND: This study was conducted to address the existing drawbacks of inconvenience and high costs associated with sleep monitoring. In this research, we performed sleep staging using continuous photoplethysmography (PPG) signals for sleep monitoring with wearable devices. Furthermore, our aim was to develop a more efficient sleep monitoring method by considering both the interpretability and uncertainty of the model's prediction results, with the goal of providing support to medical professionals in their decision-making process. METHOD: The developed 4-class sleep staging model based on continuous PPG data incorporates several key components: a local attention module, an InceptionTime module, a time-distributed dense layer, a temporal convolutional network (TCN), and a 1D convolutional network (CNN). This model prioritizes both interpretability and uncertainty estimation in its prediction results. The local attention module is introduced to provide insights into the impact of each epoch within the continuous PPG data. It achieves this by leveraging the TCN structure. To quantify the uncertainty of prediction results and facilitate selective predictions, an energy score estimation is employed. By enhancing both the performance and interpretability of the model and taking into consideration the reliability of its predictions, we developed the InsightSleepNet for accurate sleep staging. RESULT: InsightSleepNet was evaluated using three distinct datasets: MESA, CFS, and CAP. Initially, we assessed the model's classification performance both before and after applying an energy score threshold. We observed a significant improvement in the model's performance with the implementation of the energy score threshold. On the MESA dataset, prior to applying the energy score threshold, the accuracy was 84.2% with a Cohen's kappa of 0.742 and weighted F1 score of 0.842. After implementing the energy score threshold, the accuracy increased to a range of 84.8-86.1%, Cohen's kappa values ranged from 0.75 to 0.78 and weighted F1 scores ranged from 0.848 to 0.861. In the case of the CFS dataset, we also noted enhanced performance. Before the application of the energy score threshold, the accuracy stood at 80.6% with a Cohen's kappa of 0.72 and weighted F1 score of 0.808. After thresholding, the accuracy improved to a range of 81.9-85.6%, Cohen's kappa values ranged from 0.74 to 0.79 and weighted F1 scores ranged from 0.821 to 0.857. Similarly, on the CAP dataset, the initial accuracy was 80.6%, accompanied by a Cohen's kappa of 0.73 and weighted F1 score was 0.805. Following the application of the threshold, the accuracy increased to a range of 81.4-84.3%, Cohen's kappa values ranged from 0.74 to 0.79 and weighted F1 scores ranged from 0.813 to 0.842. Additionally, by interpreting the model's predictions, we obtained results indicating a correlation between the peak of the PPG signal and sleep stage classification.

To trust the AI, the women requested a thorough evaluation, transparency about AI usage in healthcare, and the involvement of a radiologist in the assessment. They would rather be more worried because of being called in more often for scans than risk having overlooked a sign of cancer. They expressed substantial trust in the healthcare system if the implementation of AI was to become a standard practice. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that the interviewed women, in general, hold a positive attitude towards the implementation of AI in mammography; nonetheless, they expect and demand more from an AI than a radiologist. Effective communication regarding the role and limitations of AI is crucial to ensure that patients understand the purpose and potential outcomes of AI-assisted healthcare.\", metadata={'PMID': '38355190', 'TI': \"Women's perceptions and attitudes towards the use of AI in mammography in Sweden: a qualitative interview study.\", 'FAU': 'Viberg Johansson, Jennifer Dembrower, Karin Strand, Fredrik Grauman, Asa', 'AU': 'Viberg Johansson J Dembrower K Strand F Grauman A', 'DP': Timestamp('2024-02-14 00:00:00'), 'MH': 'Female Humans Artificial Intelligence Sweden Qualitative Research Mammography *Neoplasms *Breast Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging', 'OT': 'patient participation patient satisfaction radiology & imaging', 'PL': 'England', 'JT': 'BMJ open', 'PMC': 'PMC10868248', 'EDAT': NaT, 'MHDA': NaT, 'STAT': 'MEDLINE'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='INTRODUCTION: Lung cancer (LC) is the most common cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Its early detection can be achieved with a CT scan. Two large randomised trials proved the efficacy of low-dose CT (LDCT)-based lung cancer screening (LCS) in high-risk populations. The decrease in specific mortality is 20%-25%.Nonetheless, implementing LCS on a large scale faces obstacles due to the low number of thoracic radiologists and CT scans available for the eligible population and the high frequency of false-positive screening results and the long period of indeterminacy of nodules that can reach up to 24 months, which is a source of prolonged anxiety and multiple costly examinations with possible side effects.Deep learning, an artificial intelligence solution has shown promising results in retrospective trials detecting lung nodules and characterising them. However, until now no prospective studies have demonstrated their importance in a real-life setting. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This open-label randomised controlled study focuses on LCS for patients aged 50-80 years, who smoked more than 20 pack-years, whether active or quit smoking less than 15 years ago. Its objective is to determine whether assisting a multidisciplinary team (MDT) with a 3D convolutional network-based analysis of screening chest CT scans accelerates the definitive classification of nodules into malignant or benign. 2722 patients will be included with the aim to demonstrate a 3-month reduction in the delay between lung nodule detection and its definitive classification into benign or malignant.

       " Document(page_content='INTRODUCTION: Many postsecondary students use social media at an age when mental health issues often arise for the first time. On social media, students describe their mental states or social interactions using psychiatric language. This is a process of mental health labelling as opposed to receiving a formal diagnosis from a psychiatrist. Despite substantial literature on psychiatric labelling effects such as stigma, little research has addressed the mechanisms and effects of labelling through social media. Our objective is to summarise the existing evidence to address this gap. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This review includes articles in English published since 1995 on how postsecondary students interact with mental health labels in their use of social media. We will consider empirical studies and theses. The search strategy includes SCOPUS, PubMed, OVID MEDLINE (to access APA PsycINFO), Web of Science and ProQuest Global Dissertations and Theses. This scoping review follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extensions for protocols and Scoping Reviews guidelines. The artificial intelligence application, Connected Papers, will assist in identifying additional references. The outcomes of interest are labelling by self or others and changes in self-concept and presentation associated with these labels. Two researchers will independently identify the included studies and extract data, solving disagreements with a third opinion. We will produce tables and narrative descriptions of the operationalisation and measurement methods of labelling and social media use, reported effects and uses of labelling, and explanatory mechanisms for the adoption of labels. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This literature review does not require ethics approval.

Atria and EAT volumes were auto-quantified using a pre-trained 3-dimensional (3D) U-Net model from pre-ablation CT images. After adjusting for factors associated with AF, Cox regression analysis was used to examine predictors of AF recurrence. The mean (+/-SD) age of patients was 56+/-11 years; 251 (75%) were men, and 79 (24%) had non-paroxysmal AF. Over 2 years of follow-up, 139 (42%) patients experienced recurrence. Diabetes, non-paroxysmal AF, non-pulmonary vein triggers, mitral line ablation, and larger LA, right atrium, and EAT volume indices were linked to increased hazards of AF recurrence. After multivariate adjustment, non-paroxysmal AF (hazard ratio [HR] 0.6; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.4-0.8; P=0.003) and larger LA-EAT volume index (HR 1.1; 95% CI 1.0-1.2; P=0.009) remained independent predictors of AF recurrence.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective study utilizing CT scans from three hospitals. Inclusion criteria were scans with 1-5 nodules of diameter >/=5mm; exclusion criteria were poor-quality scans or those with nodules measuring <5mm. In the lesion detection phase, 2147 nodules from 219 scans were used to develop and train the deep learning 3D-CNN to detect lesions. The 3D-CNN was validated with 235 scans (354 lesions) for sensitivity, specificity, and area-under-the-curve (AUC) analysis. In the path planning phase, Bayesian optimization was utilized to propose possible needle trajectories for lesion biopsy while avoiding vital structures. Software-proposed needle trajectories were compared against actual biopsy path trajectories from intraoperative CT scans in 150 patients, with a match defined as angular deviation of <5 degrees between the two. RESULTS: The model achieved an overall AUC of 97.4% (95%CI=96.3-98.2%) for lesion detection, with mean sensitivity of 93.5% and mean specificity of 93.2%. 85.3% of software-proposed needle trajectories were feasible, with 82% matching actual paths, and similar performance between supine and prone/oblique patient orientations (p=0.311).

       " Document(page_content=\"Personalized medicine can reduce adverse effects, enhance drug efficacy, and optimize treatment outcomes, which represents the essence of personalized medicine in the pharmacy field. Protein drugs are crucial in the field of personalized drug therapy and are currently the mainstay, which possess higher target specificity and biological activity compared to small-molecule chemical drugs, making them efficient in regulating disease-related biological processes, and have significant potential in the development of personalized drugs. Currently, protein drugs are designed and developed for specific protein targets based on patient-specific protein data. However, due to the rapid development of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DGE) and mass spectrometry (MS), it is now widely recognized that a canonical protein actually includes multiple proteoforms, and the differences between these proteoforms will result in varying responses to drugs. The variation in the effects of different proteoforms can be significant and the impact can even alter the intended benefit of a drug, potentially making it harmful instead of lifesaving. As a result, we propose that protein drugs should shift from being targeted through the lens of protein (proteomics) to being targeted through the lens of proteoform (proteoformics). This will enable the development of personalized protein drugs that are better equipped to meet patients' specific needs and disease characteristics. With further development in the field of proteoformics, individualized drug therapy, especially personalized protein drugs aimed at proteoforms as a drug target, will improve the understanding of disease mechanisms, discovery of new drug targets and signaling pathways, provide a theoretical basis for the development of new drugs, aid doctors in conducting health risk assessments and making more cost-effective targeted prevention strategies conducted by artificial intelligence/machine learning, promote technological innovation, and provide more convenient treatment tailored to individualized patient profile, which will benefit the affected individuals and society at large.\", metadata={'PMID': '38354979', 'TI': 'Personalized drug therapy: innovative concept guided with proteoformics.', 'FAU': 'Su, Junwen Yang, Lamei Sun, Ziran Zhan, Xianquan', 'AU': 'Su J Yang L Sun Z Zhan X', 'DP': Timestamp('2024-02-12 00:00:00'), 'MH': 'None', 'OT': 'Artificial intelligence Cost-effective targeted prevention Health risk assessment Individualized patient profile Machine learning Personalized drug therapy Personalized medicine Personalized protein drugs Protein drugs Proteoform Proteoformics Proteomics Therapeutic protein drug', 'PL': 'United States', 'JT': 'Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP', 'PMC': 'None', 'EDAT': NaT, 'MHDA': NaT, 'STAT': 'Publisher'}),\n",

RESULTS: Forty studies were included, thirty-nine developed diagnostic models. Seven studies utilized ML approaches, six were retrospective and none used multicenter data for model development. Thirty-three studies utilized DL approaches, ten were prospective, and twelve multicenter studies. Overall, all studies demonstrated high risk of bias. ML studies were evaluated in 4 domains all rated as high risk of bias: participants (6/7), predictors (1/7), outcome (3/7), and analysis (7/7), and DL studies evaluated in 3 domains: participants (24/33), outcome (10/33), and analysis (18/33). The majority of image-based studies used colonoscopy images.

       " Document(page_content='BACKGROUND: The growing prevalence of musculoskeletal diseases increases radiologic workload, highlighting the need for optimized workflow management and automated metadata classification systems. We developed a large-scale, well-characterized dataset of musculoskeletal radiographs and trained deep learning neural networks to classify radiographic projection and body side. METHODS: In this IRB-approved retrospective single-center study, a dataset of musculoskeletal radiographs from 2011 to 2019 was retrieved and manually labeled for one of 45 possible radiographic projections and the depicted body side. Two classification networks were trained for the respective tasks using the Xception architecture with a custom network top and pretrained weights. Performance was evaluated on a hold-out test sample, and gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) heatmaps were computed to visualize the influential image regions for network predictions. RESULTS: A total of 13,098 studies comprising 23,663 radiographs were included with a patient-level dataset split, resulting in 19,183 training, 2,145 validation, and 2,335 test images. Focusing on paired body regions, training for side detection included 16,319 radiographs (13,284 training, 1,443 validation, and 1,592 test images). The models achieved an overall accuracy of 0.975 for projection and 0.976 for body-side classification on the respective hold-out test sample. Errors were primarily observed in projections with seamless anatomical transitions or non-orthograde adjustment techniques. CONCLUSIONS: The deep learning neural networks demonstrated excellent performance in classifying radiographic projection and body side across a wide range of musculoskeletal radiographs. These networks have the potential to serve as presorting algorithms, optimizing radiologic workflow and enhancing patient care. RELEVANCE STATEMENT: The developed networks excel at classifying musculoskeletal radiographs, providing valuable tools for research data extraction, standardized image sorting, and minimizing misclassifications in artificial intelligence systems, ultimately enhancing radiology workflow efficiency and patient care.

Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, the WISDOM model was built using MRI (T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted imaging) and patient-level pathologic information (the number of postoperative-confirmed metastatic LNs and resected LNs) based on the data of patients with RC between January 2016 and November 2017. The incremental value of the model in assisting radiologists was investigated. The performances in binary and ternary N-staging were evaluated using area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) and the concordance index (C-index), respectively. Results A total of 1014 patients (median age, 62 years; IQR, 54-68 years; 590 male) were analyzed, including the training cohort (n = 589) and internal test cohort (n = 146) from center I, and two external test cohorts (cohort 1: n = 117; cohort 2: n = 162) from centers II and III, respectively. The WISDOM model yielded an overall AUC of 0.81 and C-index of 0.765, significantly outperforming junior radiologists (AUC = 0.69, P < .001; C-index = 0.689, P < .001), and performing comparably with senior radiologists (AUC = 0.79, P = .21; C-index = 0.788, P = .22).

The prepared 8-electrode carbon-based conductive network achieves high-precision identification of 32 regions with 97% classification accuracy assisted by a quadratic discriminant analysis algorithm. Notably, the output of the sensor remains unchanged after 13,000 cycles at 60 kPa, indicating its excellent durability performance. Moreover, the large-area skin-like continuous conductive network is simple to fabricate, cost-effective, and can be easily scaled up/down depending on the application. This work may address the increasing need for simple fabrication, rapid integration, and adaptable geometry tactile sensors for use in industrial robots.', metadata={'PMID': '38353218', 'TI': 'Improving the Resolution of Flexible Large-Area Tactile Sensors through Machine-Learning Perception.', 'FAU': 'Zhang, Tong Zhao, Minghui Zhai, Mingxuan Wang, Lisha Ma, Xingyu Liao, Shengmei Wang, Xiaona Liu, Yijian Chen, Da', 'AU': 'Zhang T Zhao M Zhai M Wang L Ma X Liao S Wang X Liu Y Chen D', 'DP': Timestamp('2024-02-28 00:00:00'), 'MH': 'None', 'OT': 'flexible tactile sensors large-area machine learning simple fabrication skin perception', 'PL': 'United States', 'JT': 'ACS applied materials & interfaces', 'PMC': 'None', 'EDAT': NaT, 'MHDA': NaT, 'STAT': 'PubMed-not-MEDLINE'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='BACKGROUND: The internet is a common source of health information for patients. Interactive online artificial intelligence (AI) may be a more reliable source of health-related information than traditional search engines. This study aimed to assess the quality and perceived utility of chat-based AI responses related to 3 common gastrointestinal (GI) surgical procedures. METHODS: A survey of 24 questions covering general perioperative information on cholecystectomy, pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD), and colectomy was created. Each question was posed to Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) in June 2023, and the generated responses were recorded. The quality and perceived utility of responses were independently and subjectively graded by expert respondents specific to each surgical field. Grades were classified as \"poor,\" \"fair,\" \"good,\" \"very good,\" or \"excellent.\" RESULTS: Among the 45 respondents (general surgeon [n = 13], surgical oncologist [n = 18], colorectal surgeon [n = 13], and transplant surgeon [n = 1]), most practiced at an academic facility (95.6%). Respondents had been in practice for a mean of 12.3 years (general surgeon, 14.5 +/- 7.2; surgical oncologist, 12.1 +/- 8.2; colorectal surgeon, 10.2 +/- 8.0) and performed a mean 53 index operations annually (cholecystectomy, 47 +/- 28; PD, 28 +/- 27; colectomy, 81 +/- 44). Overall, the most commonly assigned quality grade was \"fair\" or \"good\" for most responses (n = 622/1080, 57.6%). Most of the 1080 total utility grades were \"fair\" (n = 279, 25.8%) or \"good\" (n = 344, 31.9%), whereas only 129 utility grades (11.9%) were \"poor.\" Of note, ChatGPT responses related to cholecystectomy (45.3% [\"very good\"/\"excellent\"] vs 18.1% [\"poor\"/\"fair\"]) were deemed to be better quality than AI responses about PD (18.9% [\"very good\"/\"excellent\"] vs 46.9% [\"poor\"/\"fair\"]) or colectomy (31.4% [\"very good\"/\"excellent\"] vs 38.3% [\"poor\"/\"fair\"]). Overall, only 20.0% of the experts deemed ChatGPT to be an accurate source of information, whereas 15.6% of the experts found it unreliable. Moreover, 1 in 3 surgeons deemed ChatGPT responses as not likely to reduce patient-physician correspondence (31.1%) or not comparable to in-person surgeon responses (35.6%).

       " Document(page_content='The spread of tuberculosis (TB), especially multidrug-resistant TB and extensively drug-resistant TB, has strongly motivated the research and development of new anti-TB drugs. New strategies to facilitate drug combinations, including pharmacokinetics-guided dose optimization and toxicology studies of first- and second-line anti-TB drugs have also been introduced and recommended. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) has arguably become the gold standard in the analysis of both endo- and exo-genous compounds. This technique has been applied successfully not only for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) but also for pharmacometabolomics analysis. TDM improves the effectiveness of treatment, reduces adverse drug reactions, and the likelihood of drug resistance development in TB patients by determining dosage regimens that produce concentrations within the therapeutic target window. Based on TDM, the dose would be optimized individually to achieve favorable outcomes. Pharmacometabolomics is essential in generating and validating hypotheses regarding the metabolism of anti-TB drugs, aiding in the discovery of potential biomarkers for TB diagnostics, treatment monitoring, and outcome evaluation. This article highlighted the current progresses in TDM of anti-TB drugs based on LC-MS bioassay in the last two decades. Besides, we discussed the advantages and disadvantages of this technique in practical use. The pressing need for non-invasive sampling approaches and stability studies of anti-TB drugs was highlighted.

METHODS: Based on TCGA, ICGC, CGGA, GSE30219, GSE31210, GSE37745, GSE50081, GSE22138, GSE41613, univariate Cox regression, LASSO regression, and multivariate Cox regression were used to construct the rough gene signature based on disulfidptosis for each type of cancer. SsGSEA and Cibersort, followed by correlation analysis, were harnessed to explore the linkage between disulfidptosis and cancer immunity. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) and Machine learning were utilized to make a refined prognosis model for pan-cancer. In particular, a customized, enhanced prognosis model was made for glioma. The siRNA transfection, FACS, ELISA, etc., were employed to validate the function of c-MET. RESULTS: The expression comparison of the disulfidptosis-related genes (DRGs) between tumor and nontumor tissues implied a significant difference in most cancers. The correlation between disulfidptosis and immune cell infiltration, including T cell exhaustion (Tex), was evident, especially in glioma. The 7-gene signature was constructed as the rough model for the glioma prognosis. A pan-cancer suitable DSP clustering was made and validated to predict the prognosis. Furthermore, two DSP groups were defined by machine learning to predict the survival and immune therapy response in glioma, which was validated in CGGA. PD-L1 and other immune pathways were highly enriched in the core blue gene module from WGCNA. Among them, c-MET was validated as a tumor driver gene and JAK3-STAT3-PD-L1/PD1 regulator in glioma and T cells. Specifically, the down-regulation of c-MET decreased the proportion of PD1+ CD8+ T cells. CONCLUSION: To summarize, we dissected the roles of DRGs in the prognosis and their relationship with immunity in pan-cancer. A general prognosis model based on machine learning was constructed for pan-cancer and validated by external datasets with a consistent result.

Recent findings suggest the existence of brain-behavior relationship heterogeneities during infancy; however, it remains unclear whether sex underlies these heterogeneities during this critical period when sex-related behavioral differences arise. METHODS: A sample of 316 infants was included with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans at neonate (3 weeks), 1, and 2 years of age. We used multiple linear regression to test interactions between sex and resting-state functional connectivity on behavioral scores of working memory, inhibitory self-control, intelligence, and anxiety collected at 4 years of age. RESULTS: We found six age-specific, intra-hemispheric connections showing significant and robust sex differences in functional connectivity-behavior relationships. All connections are either with the prefrontal cortex or the temporal pole, which has direct anatomical pathways to the prefrontal cortex. Sex differences in functional connectivity only emerge when associated with behavior, and not in functional connectivity alone. Furthermore, at neonate and 2 years of age, these age-specific connections displayed greater connectivity in males and lower connectivity in females in association with better behavioral scores.

       " Document(page_content=\"BACKGROUND: Patients with cancer often have to make complex decisions about treatment, with the options varying in risk profiles and effects on survival and quality of life. Moreover, inefficient care paths make it hard for patients to participate in shared decision-making. Data-driven decision-support tools have the potential to empower patients, support personalized care, improve health outcomes and promote health equity. However, decision-support tools currently seldom consider quality of life or individual preferences, and their use in clinical practice remains limited, partly because they are not well integrated in patients' care paths. AIM AND OBJECTIVES: The central aim of the 4D PICTURE project is to redesign patients' care paths and develop and integrate evidence-based decision-support tools to improve decision-making processes in cancer care delivery. This article presents an overview of this international, interdisciplinary project. DESIGN METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In co-creation with patients and other stakeholders, we will develop data-driven decision-support tools for patients with breast cancer, prostate cancer and melanoma. We will support treatment decisions by using large, high-quality datasets with state-of-the-art prognostic algorithms. We will further develop a conversation tool, the Metaphor Menu, using text mining combined with citizen science techniques and linguistics, incorporating large datasets of patient experiences, values and preferences. We will further develop a promising methodology, MetroMapping, to redesign care paths. We will evaluate MetroMapping and these integrated decision-support tools, and ensure their sustainability using the Nonadoption, Abandonment, Scale-Up, Spread, and Sustainability (NASSS) framework. We will explore the generalizability of MetroMapping and the decision-support tools for other types of cancer and across other EU member states.

       " Document(page_content=\"OBJECTIVES: This diagnostic study assessed the accuracy of radiologists retrospectively, using the deep learning and natural language processing chest algorithms implemented in Clinical Review version 3.2 for: pneumothorax, rib fractures in digital chest X-ray radiographs (CXR); aortic aneurysm, pulmonary nodules, emphysema, and pulmonary embolism in CT images. METHODS: The study design was double-blind (artificial intelligence [AI] algorithms and humans), retrospective, non-interventional, and at a single NHS Trust. Adult patients (>/=18 years old) scheduled for CXR and CT were invited to enroll as participants through an opt-out process. Reports and images were de-identified, processed retrospectively, and AI-flagged discrepant findings were assigned to two lead radiologists, each blinded to patient identifiers and original radiologist. The radiologist's findings for each clinical condition were tallied as a verified discrepancy (true positive) or not (false positive). RESULTS: The missed findings were: 0.02% rib fractures, 0.51% aortic aneurysm, 0.32% pulmonary nodules, 0.92% emphysema, and 0.28% pulmonary embolism. The positive predictive values (PPVs) were: pneumothorax (0%), rib fractures (5.6%), aortic dilatation (43.2%), pulmonary emphysema (46.0%), pulmonary embolus (11.5%), and pulmonary nodules (9.2%). The PPV for pneumothorax was nil owing to lack of available studies that were analysed for outpatient activity. CONCLUSIONS: The number of missed findings was far less than generally predicted. The chest algorithms deployed retrospectively were a useful quality tool and AI augmented the radiologists' workflow. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: The diagnostic accuracy of our radiologists generated missed findings of 0.02% for rib fractures CXR, 0.51% for aortic dilatation, 0.32% for pulmonary nodule, 0.92% for pulmonary emphysema, and 0.28% for pulmonary embolism for CT studies, all retrospectively evaluated with AI used as a quality tool to flag potential missed findings.

More recently, there has been a growing recognition that interventions involving artificial intelligence (AI) need to undergo rigorous, prospective evaluation to demonstrate impact on health outcomes. The CONSORT-AI (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials-Artificial Intelligence) extension is a new reporting guideline for clinical trials evaluating interventions with an AI component. It was developed in parallel with its companion statement for clinical trial protocols: SPIRIT-AI (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials-Artificial Intelligence). Both guidelines were developed through a staged consensus process involving literature review and expert consultation to generate 29 candidate items, which were assessed by an international multi-stakeholder group in a two-stage Delphi survey (103 stakeholders), agreed upon in a two-day consensus meeting (31 stakeholders) and refined through a checklist pilot (34 participants). The CONSORT-AI extension includes 14 new items that were considered sufficiently important for AI interventions that they should be routinely reported in addition to the core CONSORT 2010 items. CONSORT-AI recommends that investigators provide clear descriptions of the AI intervention, including instructions and skills required for use, the setting in which the AI intervention is integrated, the handling of inputs and outputs of the AI intervention, the human-AI interaction and provision of an analysis of error cases.

The objective is to develop artificial intelligence to predict the post-transcatheter aortic valve replacement aortic valve pressure gradient and aortic valve area from preprocedural echocardiography and computed tomography data. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement due to aortic valve stenosis. A total of 1091 patients were analyzed for pressure gradient predictions (mean age 76.8 +/- 9.2 years, 57.8% male), and 1063 patients were analyzed for aortic valve area predictions (mean age 76.7 +/- 9.3 years, 57.2% male). An artificial intelligence learning model was trained (training: n = 663 patients, validation: n = 206 patients) and tested (testing: n = 222 patients) to predict pressure gradient, and a separate artificial intelligence learning model was trained (training: n = 640 patients, validation: n = 218 patients) and tested (testing: n = 205 patients) for predicting aortic valve area. RESULTS: The mean absolute error for pressure gradient and aortic valve area predictions was 3.0 mm Hg and 0.45 cm(2), respectively. Valve sheath size, body surface area, and age were determined to be the top 3 predictors for pressure gradient, and valve sheath size, left ventricular ejection fraction, and aortic annulus mean diameter were identified to be the top 3 predictors of post-transcatheter aortic valve replacement aortic valve area. A training dataset size of more than 500 patients demonstrated good robustness of the artificial intelligence models for pressure gradient and aortic valve area.

       " Document(page_content=\"INTRODUCTION: A challenge when applying an artificial intelligence (AI) deep learning (DL) approach to novel electroencephalography (EEG) data, is the DL architecture's lack of adaptability to changing numbers of EEG channels. That is, the number of channels cannot vary neither in the training data, nor upon deployment. Such highly specific hardware constraints put major limitations on the clinical usability and scalability of the DL models. METHODS: In this work, we propose a technique for handling such varied numbers of EEG channels by splitting the EEG montages into distinct regions and merge the channels within the same region to a region representation. The solution is termed Region Based Pooling (RBP). The procedure of splitting the montage into regions is performed repeatedly with different region configurations, to minimize potential loss of information. As RBP maps a varied number of EEG channels to a fixed number of region representations, both current and future DL architectures may apply RBP with ease. To demonstrate and evaluate the adequacy of RBP to handle a varied number of EEG channels, sex classification based solely on EEG was used as a test example. The DL models were trained on 129 channels, and tested on 32, 65, and 129-channels versions of the data using the same channel positions scheme. The baselines for comparison were zero-filling the missing channels and applying spherical spline interpolation. The performances were estimated using 5-fold cross validation. RESULTS: For the 32-channel system version, the mean AUC values across the folds were: RBP (93.34%), spherical spline interpolation (93.36%), and zero-filling (76.82%). Similarly, on the 65-channel system version, the performances were: RBP (93.66%), spherical spline interpolation (93.50%), and zero-filling (85.58%). Finally, the 129-channel system version produced the following results: RBP (94.68%), spherical spline interpolation (93.86%), and zero-filling (91.92%). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, RBP obtained similar results to spherical spline interpolation, and superior results to zero-filling. We encourage further research and development of DL models in the cross-dataset setting, including the use of methods such as RBP and spherical spline interpolation to handle a varied number of EEG channels.\", metadata={'PMID': '38351907', 'TI': 'Introducing Region Based Pooling for handling a varied number of EEG channels for deep learning models.', 'FAU': 'Tveitstol, Thomas Tveter, Mats Perez T, Ana S Hatlestad-Hall, Christoffer Yazidi, Anis Hammer, Hugo L Hebold Haraldsen, Ira R J', 'AU': 'Tveitstol T Tveter M Perez T AS Hatlestad-Hall C Yazidi A Hammer HL Hebold Haraldsen IRJ', 'DP': NaT, 'MH': 'None', 'OT': 'EEG Region Based Pooling convolutional neural networks cross-channel system cross-dataset deep learning machine learning time series', 'PL': 'Switzerland', 'JT': 'Frontiers in neuroinformatics', 'PMC': 'PMC10861709', 'EDAT': NaT, 'MHDA': NaT, 'STAT': 'PubMed-not-MEDLINE'}),\n",

From September 2022 to March 2023, ten self-selected first-year students enrolled in the elective curriculum run in parallel with four existing curricular blocks (Immunology, Hematology, Cardiology, and Pulmonology). Each DHS block consisted of a journal club, a live-coding demonstration, and an integration session led by a researcher in that field. Students' confidence in explaining the content objectives (high-level knowledge, implications, and limitations of AI) was measured before and after each block and compared using Mann-Whitney U tests.

Traditional assessment methods cannot comprehensively assess park use and environmental conditions. Besides, although social media and big data have shown significant advantages in understanding public behavior or preference and park features or values, there has been little relevant research on park management assessment. This study proposes a deep learning-based framework for assessing urban park intelligent management from macro to micro levels with comment data from social media.

As a proof of concept, in this research, we test the replicability of past results regarding the positive effects of facial expressiveness (e.g., gazing, nodding, and smiling) on social outcomes. Because the facial expressions when listening to someone (i.e., nonverbal immediacy) encompass several behaviors that are typically related (i.e., smiling while nodding), the effect of combinations of these behaviors is challenging to study. We thus test the effect of facial expressiveness (gazing, nodding, and smiling vs. none) on first impression judgements in a job interview setting using AI-generated experimental video material. We measure how competent, warm, and favorably independent observers (n = 823) perceive the targets (n = 159) showing AI-generated facial expressions.

Negative emotions and social isolation significantly impact mental and physical health. To support older adults and address these challenges, healthcare professionals can use Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) such as health monitoring systems with multiple sensors. These systems include digital biomarkers and data analytics that can streamline the diagnosis process and help older adults to maintain their independence and quality of life. METHOD: A design research methodology is followed to define a conceptual model as the main artifact and basis for the systematic design of successful systems centered on older adults monitoring within the health domain. RESULTS: The results include a conceptual model focused on older adults' Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) and Health Status, considering various health dimensions, including social, emotional, physical, and cognitive dimensions. We also provide a detailed instantiation of the model in real use cases to validate the usefulness and feasibility of the proposal. In particular, the model has been used to develop two health systems intended to measure the degree of the elders' frailty and dependence with biomarkers and machine learning. CONCLUSIONS: The defined conceptual model can be the basis to develop health monitoring systems with multiple sensors and intelligence based on data analytics. This model offers a holistic approach to caring for and supporting older adults as they age, considering ADLs and various health dimensions.

The prevalent use of ICSI as a solution for severe male infertility, despite its potential to propagate genetically defective sperm, consequently posing a threat to progeny health, illuminates this paradox. We posit that the meteoric rise in Industrial Revolution 4.0 (IR 4.0) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies holds the potential for a transformative shift in addressing male infertility, specifically by mitigating the limitations engendered by 'andrological ignorance.' We advocate for the urgent need to transcend andrological ignorance, envisaging AI as a cornerstone in the precise diagnosis and treatment of the root causes of male infertility. This approach also incorporates the identification of potential genetic defects in descendants, the establishment of knowledge platforms dedicated to male reproductive health, and the optimization of therapeutic outcomes. Our hypothesis suggests that the assimilation of AI could streamline ICSI implementation, leading to an overall enhancement in the realm of male fertility treatments.

METHODS: The participants in the study were 12 children with RE and 26 children with RD aged 4 to 10 years (all without medication and shortly after diagnosis) and 31 healthy controls. Their cognitive performance was assessed using the German versions of the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI-III), the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-IV), the Developmental Test of Visual Perception-2 (DTVP-2), the Developmental Test of Visual Perception-Adolescent and Adult (DTVP-A) (each according to age) and the Word Order, Hand Movements and Spatial Memory subtests of the German version of the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children (K-ABC). RESULTS: The comparison of the entire group of children with RE/RD and the control group conducted in the first step of our analysis revealed a weaker performance of the children with RE/RD in all cognitive domains. Significant deficits, however, were found exclusively in the RD group. Compared to the controls, they performed significantly weaker regarding IQ (full scale IQ: p < 0.001; verbal IQ: p < 0.001; performance IQ: p = 0.002; processing speed: p = 0.005), visual perception (general visual perception: p = 0.005; visual-motor integration: p = 0.002) and working memory (WISC working memory: p = 0.002 and K-ABC Word Order (p = 0.010) and Hand Movements (p = 0.001) subtests. Also, the children without seizures scored significantly lower than those with seizures on the WISC Working Memory Index (p = 0.010) and on the K-ABC Word Order (p = 0.021) and Hand Movements (p = 0.027) subtests. Further analysis of our data demonstrated the particular importance of the family context for child development. Significant cognitive deficits were found only in children with RD from parents with lower educational levels. This group consistently scored lower compared to the control group regarding IQ (full scale IQ: p < 0.001; verbal IQ: p < 0.001; performance IQ: p = 0.012; processing speed: p = 0.034), visual perception (general visual perception: p = 0.018; visual-motor integration: p = 0.010) and auditory working memory (WISC working memory: p = 0.014). Furthermore, compared to the children with RE, they performed significantly weaker on verbal IQ (p = 0.020), auditory working memory consistently (WISC working memory: p = 0.027; K-ABC: Word Order: p = 0.046) as well as in one of the K-ABC spatial working memory subtests (Hand Movements: p = 0.029). Although we did not find significant deficits in children with new-onset RE compared to healthy controls, the performance of this group tended to be weaker more often. No statistically significant associations were observed between selected clinical markers (focus types: centrotemporal/other foci/laterality of foci and spread of Rolandic discharges) and cognitive test results. Except for spatial working memory, we also found no evidence that the age of our patients at the time of study participation was of significant importance to their cognitive performance.

Artificial intelligence (AI) emerges as a promising tool to identify definitive predictors for ankle sprains. This paper aims to summarize the use of AI in investigating the ankle biomechanics of healthy and subjects with ankle sprains. METHODS: Articles published between 2010 and 2023 were searched from five electronic databases. 59 papers were included for analysis with regards to: i). types of motion tested (functional vs. purposeful ankle movement); ii) types of biomechanical parameters measured (kinetic vs kinematic); iii) types of sensor systems used (lab-based vs field-based); and, iv) AI techniques used. FINDINGS: Most studies (83.1%) examined biomechanics during functional motion. Single kinematic parameter, specifically ankle range of motion, could obtain accuracy up to 100% in identifying injury status. Wearable sensor exhibited high reliability for use in both laboratory and on-field/clinical settings. AI algorithms primarily utilized electromyography and joint angle information as input data.

Furthermore, some studies suggest that they are less physically active as young adults than controls, but the relationship between physical activity and cognitive function remains unclear. We performed an individual participant data meta-analysis to examine whether being born preterm/with very low birth weight is associated with physical activity in adulthood and examined if cognitive function mediates this association. STUDY DESIGN: Cohorts with data on physical activity and cognitive function in adults born very preterm/very low birth weight and term-born controls were recruited from the Research on European Children and Adults Born Preterm, and the Adults Born Preterm International Collaboration Consortia.

       " Document(page_content=\"BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI)-based chatbots could help address some of the challenges patients face in acquiring information essential to their self-health management, including unreliable sources and overburdened health care professionals. Research to ensure the proper design, implementation, and uptake of chatbots is imperative. Inclusive digital health research and responsible AI integration into health care require active and sustained patient and stakeholder engagement, yet corresponding activities and guidance are limited for this purpose. OBJECTIVE: In response, this manuscript presents a master protocol for the development, testing, and implementation of a chatbot family in partnership with stakeholders. This protocol aims to help efficiently translate an initial chatbot intervention (MARVIN) to multiple health domains and populations. METHODS: The MARVIN chatbots study has an adaptive platform trial design consisting of multiple parallel individual chatbot substudies with four common objectives: (1) co-construct a tailored AI chatbot for a specific health care setting, (2) assess its usability with a small sample of participants, (3) measure implementation outcomes (usability, acceptability, appropriateness, adoption, and fidelity) within a large sample, and (4) evaluate the impact of patient and stakeholder partnerships on chatbot development. For objective 1, a needs assessment will be conducted within the setting, involving four 2-hour focus groups with 5 participants each. Then, a co-construction design committee will be formed with patient partners, health care professionals, and researchers who will participate in 6 workshops for chatbot development, testing, and improvement. For objective 2, a total of 30 participants will interact with the prototype for 3 weeks and assess its usability through a survey and 3 focus groups. Positive usability outcomes will lead to the initiation of objective 3, whereby the public will be able to access the chatbot for a 12-month real-world implementation study using web-based questionnaires to measure usability, acceptability, and appropriateness for 150 participants and meta-use data to inform adoption and fidelity. After each objective, for objective 4, focus groups will be conducted with the design committee to better understand their perspectives on the engagement process. RESULTS: From July 2022 to October 2023, this master protocol led to four substudies conducted at the McGill University Health Centre or the Centre hospitalier de l'Universite de Montreal (both in Montreal, Quebec, Canada): (1) MARVIN for HIV (large-scale implementation expected in mid-2024), (2) MARVIN-Pharma for community pharmacists providing HIV care (usability study planned for mid-2024), (3) MARVINA for breast cancer, and (4) MARVIN-CHAMP for pediatric infectious conditions (both in preparation, with development to begin in early 2024). CONCLUSIONS: This master protocol offers an approach to chatbot development in partnership with patients and health care professionals that includes a comprehensive assessment of implementation outcomes. It also contributes to best practice recommendations for patient and stakeholder engagement in digital health research.

       " Document(page_content=\"BACKGROUND: Patients with rare and complex diseases often experience delayed diagnoses and misdiagnoses because comprehensive knowledge about these diseases is limited to only a few medical experts. In this context, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful knowledge aggregation tools with applications in clinical decision support and education domains. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore the potential of 3 popular LLMs, namely Bard (Google LLC), ChatGPT-3.5 (OpenAI), and GPT-4 (OpenAI), in medical education to enhance the diagnosis of rare and complex diseases while investigating the impact of prompt engineering on their performance. METHODS: We conducted experiments on publicly available complex and rare cases to achieve these objectives. We implemented various prompt strategies to evaluate the performance of these models using both open-ended and multiple-choice prompts. In addition, we used a majority voting strategy to leverage diverse reasoning paths within language models, aiming to enhance their reliability. Furthermore, we compared their performance with the performance of human respondents and MedAlpaca, a generative LLM specifically designed for medical tasks. RESULTS: Notably, all LLMs outperformed the average human consensus and MedAlpaca, with a minimum margin of 5% and 13%, respectively, across all 30 cases from the diagnostic case challenge collection. On the frequently misdiagnosed cases category, Bard tied with MedAlpaca but surpassed the human average consensus by 14%, whereas GPT-4 and ChatGPT-3.5 outperformed MedAlpaca and the human respondents on the moderately often misdiagnosed cases category with minimum accuracy scores of 28% and 11%, respectively. The majority voting strategy, particularly with GPT-4, demonstrated the highest overall score across all cases from the diagnostic complex case collection, surpassing that of other LLMs. On the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III data sets, Bard and GPT-4 achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy scores, with multiple-choice prompts scoring 93%, whereas ChatGPT-3.5 and MedAlpaca scored 73% and 47%, respectively. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that there is no one-size-fits-all prompting approach for improving the performance of LLMs and that a single strategy does not universally apply to all LLMs. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings shed light on the diagnostic capabilities of LLMs and the challenges associated with identifying an optimal prompting strategy that aligns with each language model's characteristics and specific task requirements. The significance of prompt engineering is highlighted, providing valuable insights for researchers and practitioners who use these language models for medical training. Furthermore, this study represents a crucial step toward understanding how LLMs can enhance diagnostic reasoning in rare and complex medical cases, paving the way for developing effective educational tools and accurate diagnostic aids to improve patient care and outcomes.\", metadata={'PMID': '38349725', 'TI': 'Learning to Make Rare and Complex Diagnoses With Generative AI Assistance: Qualitative Study of Popular Large Language Models.', 'FAU': 'Abdullahi, Tassallah Singh, Ritambhara Eickhoff, Carsten', 'AU': 'Abdullahi T Singh R Eickhoff C', 'DP': Timestamp('2024-02-13 00:00:00'), 'MH': 'Humans Reproducibility of Results *Learning Educational Status *Problem Solving Language', 'OT': 'AI assistance Bard ChatGPT 3.5 GPT-4 MedAlpaca artificial intelligence clinical decision support complex diagnosis complex diseases consistency language model medical education medical training natural language processing prediction model prompt engineering rare diseases reliability', 'PL': 'Canada', 'JT': 'JMIR medical education', 'PMC': 'PMC10900078', 'EDAT': NaT, 'MHDA': NaT, 'STAT': 'MEDLINE'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='BACKGROUND: Extraction of toxicological end points from primary sources is a central component of systematic reviews and human health risk assessments. To ensure optimal use of these data, consistent language should be used for end point descriptions. However, primary source language describing treatment-related end points can vary greatly, resulting in large labor efforts to manually standardize extractions before data are fit for use. OBJECTIVES: To minimize these labor efforts, we applied an augmented intelligence approach and developed automated tools to support standardization of extracted information via application of preexisting controlled vocabularies. METHODS: We created and applied a harmonized controlled vocabulary crosswalk, consisting of Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) codes, German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) DevTox harmonized terms, and The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) end point vocabularies, to roughly 34,000 extractions from prenatal developmental toxicology studies conducted by the National Toxicology Program (NTP) and 6,400 extractions from European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) prenatal developmental toxicology studies, all recorded based on the original study report language. RESULTS: We automatically applied standardized controlled vocabulary terms to 75% of the NTP extracted end points and 57% of the ECHA extracted end points. Of all the standardized extracted end points, about half (51%) required manual review for potential extraneous matches or inaccuracies. Extracted end points that were not mapped to standardized terms tended to be too general or required human logic to find a good match. We estimate that this augmented intelligence approach saved  > 350 hours of manual effort and yielded valuable resources including a controlled vocabulary crosswalk, organized related terms lists, code for implementing an automated mapping workflow, and a computationally accessible dataset. DISCUSSION: Augmenting manual efforts with automation tools increased the efficiency of producing a findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) dataset of regulatory guideline studies.

Consequently, this study aimed to investigate the potential of ChatGPT-4 to assist with blood morphology identification. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study using blood images obtained from the American Society of Hematology (ASH). These images comprised a range of normal and abnormal morphologies.

This is particularly evident in the coffee industry, where fungal diseases like Cercospora coffeicola, causing brown-eye spot, can reduce yields drastically. This study focuses on forecasting coffee brown-eye spot using various models that incorporate agrometeorological data, allowing for predictions at least 1 week prior to the occurrence of disease. Data were gathered from eight locations across Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais, encompassing the South and Cerrado regions of Minas Gerais state. In the initial phase, various machine learning (ML) models and topologies were calibrated to forecast brown-eye spot, identifying one with potential for advanced decision-making. The top-performing models were then employed in the next stage to forecast and spatially project the severity of brown-eye spot across 2681 key Brazilian coffee-producing municipalities. Meteorological data were sourced from NASA's Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resources platform, and the Penman-Monteith method was used to estimate reference evapotranspiration, leading to a Thornthwaite and Mather water-balance calculation. Six ML models - K-nearest neighbors (KNN), artificial neural network multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), random forests (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and gradient boosting regression (GradBOOSTING) - were employed, considering disease latency to time define input variables. RESULTS: These models utilized climatic elements such as average air temperature, relative humidity, leaf wetness duration, rainfall, evapotranspiration, water deficit, and surplus. The XGBoost model proved most effective in high-yielding conditions, demonstrating high precision and accuracy. Conversely, the SVM model excelled in low-yielding scenarios. The incidence of brown-eye spot varied noticeably between high- and low-yield conditions, with significant regional differences observed. The accuracy of predicting brown-eye spot severity in coffee plantations depended on the biennial production cycle. High-yielding trees showed superior results with the XGBoost model (R(2)  = 0.77, root mean squared error, RMSE = 10.53), whereas the SVM model performed better under low-yielding conditions (precision 0.76, RMSE = 12.82). CONCLUSION: The study's application of agrometeorological variables and ML models successfully predicted the incidence of brown-eye spot in coffee plantations with a 7 day lead time, illustrating that they were valuable tools for managing this significant agricultural challenge.

       " Document(page_content=\"BACKGROUND: Infants born preterm are at increased risk of cognitive and motor impairments compared with infants born at term. Early developmental interventions for preterm infants are targeted at the infant or the parent-infant relationship, or both, and may focus on different aspects of early development. They aim to improve developmental outcomes for these infants, but the long-term benefits remain unclear. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2007 and updated in 2012 and 2015. OBJECTIVES: Primary objective To assess the effect of early developmental interventions compared with standard care in prevention of motor or cognitive impairment for preterm infants in infancy (zero to < three years), preschool age (three to < five years), and school age (five to < 18 years). Secondary objective To assess the effect of early developmental interventions compared with standard care on motor or cognitive impairment for subgroups of preterm infants, including groups based on gestational age, birthweight, brain injury, timing or focus of intervention and study quality. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO and trial registries in July 2023. We cross-referenced relevant literature, including identified trials and existing review articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: Studies included randomised, quasi-randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or cluster-randomised trials of early developmental intervention programmes that began within the first 12 months of life for infants born before 37 weeks' gestational age (GA). Interventions could commence as an inpatient but had to include a post discharge component for inclusion in this review. Outcome measures were not prespecified, other than that they had to assess cognitive outcomes, motor outcomes or both. The control groups in the studies could receive standard care that would normally be provided. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted from the included studies regarding study and participant characteristics, timing and focus of interventions and cognitive and motor outcomes. Meta-analysis using RevMan was carried out to determine the effects of early developmental interventions at each age range: infancy (zero to < three years), preschool age (three to < five years) and school age (five to < 18 years) on cognitive and motor outcomes. Subgroup analyses focused on GA, birthweight, brain injury, time of commencement of the intervention, focus of the intervention and study quality. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane to collect data and evaluate bias. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. MAIN RESULTS: Forty-four studies met the inclusion criteria (5051 randomly assigned participants). There were 19 new studies identified in this update (600 participants) and a further 17 studies awaiting outcomes. Three previously included studies had new data. There was variability in the focus and intensity of the interventions, participant characteristics, and length of follow-up. All included studies were either single or multicentre trials and the number of participants varied from fewer than 20 to up to 915 in one study. The trials included in this review were mainly undertaken in middle- or high-income countries. The majority of studies commenced in the hospital, with fewer commencing once the infant was home. The focus of the intervention programmes for new included studies was increasingly targeted at both the infant and the parent-infant relationship. The intensity and dosages of interventions varied between studies, which is important when considering the applicability of any programme in a clinical setting. Meta-analysis demonstrated that early developmental intervention may improve cognitive outcomes in infancy (developmental quotient (DQ): standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.27 standard deviations (SDs), 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15 to 0.40; P < 0.001; 25 studies; 3132 participants, low-certainty evidence), and improves cognitive outcomes at preschool age (intelligence quotient (IQ); SMD 0.39 SD, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.50; P < 0.001; 9 studies; 1524 participants, high-certainty evidence). However, early developmental intervention may not improve cognitive outcomes at school age (IQ: SMD 0.16 SD, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.38; P = 0.15; 6 studies; 1453 participants, low-certainty evidence). Heterogeneity between studies for cognitive outcomes in infancy and preschool age was moderate and at school age was substantial. Regarding motor function, meta-analysis of 23 studies showed that early developmental interventions may improve motor outcomes in infancy (motor scale DQ: SMD 0.12 SD, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.19; P = 0.003; 23 studies; 2737 participants, low-certainty evidence). At preschool age, the intervention probably did not improve motor outcomes (motor scale: SMD 0.08 SD, 95% CI -0.16 to 0.32; P = 0.53; 3 studies; 264 participants, moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence at school age for both continuous (motor scale: SMD -0.06 SD, 95% CI -0.31 to 0.18; P = 0.61; three studies; 265 participants, low-certainty evidence) and dichotomous outcome measures (low score on Movement Assessment Battery for Children (ABC) : RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.32; P = 0.74; 3 studies; 413 participants, low-certainty evidence) suggests that intervention may not improve motor outcome. The main source of bias was performance bias, where there was a lack of blinding of participants and personnel, which was unavoidable in this type of intervention study. Other biases in some studies included attrition bias where the outcome data were incomplete, and inadequate allocation concealment or selection bias. The GRADE assessment identified a lower certainty of evidence in the cognitive and motor outcomes at school age. Cognitive outcomes at preschool age demonstrated a high certainty due to more consistency and a larger treatment effect. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Early developmental intervention programmes for preterm infants probably improve cognitive and motor outcomes during infancy (low-certainty evidence) while, at preschool age, intervention is shown to improve cognitive outcomes (high-certainty evidence). Considerable heterogeneity exists between studies due to variations in aspects of the intervention programmes, the population and outcome measures utilised. Further research is needed to determine which types of early developmental interventions are most effective in improving cognitive and motor outcomes, and in particular to discern whether there is a longer-term benefit from these programmes.\", metadata={'PMID': '38348930', 'TI': 'Early developmental intervention programmes provided post hospital discharge to prevent motor and cognitive impairment in preterm infants.', 'FAU': 'Orton, Jane Doyle, Lex W Tripathi, Tanya Boyd, Roslyn Anderson, Peter J Spittle, Alicia', 'AU': 'Orton J Doyle LW Tripathi T Boyd R Anderson PJ Spittle A', 'DP': Timestamp('2024-02-13 00:00:00'), 'MH': 'Infant, Newborn Infant Child Child, Preschool Humans Adolescent Birth Weight Patient Discharge Infant, Premature *Cognitive Dysfunction/prevention & control *Brain Injuries', 'OT': 'None', 'PL': 'England', 'JT': 'The Cochrane database of systematic reviews', 'PMC': 'PMC10862558', 'EDAT': NaT, 'MHDA': NaT, 'STAT': 'MEDLINE'}),\n",

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the accuracy of ChatGPT's recommendations on medical questions related to common cardiac symptoms or conditions. METHODS: We tested ChatGPT's ability to address medical questions in two ways. First, we assessed its accuracy in correctly answering cardiovascular trivia questions (n = 50), based on quizzes for medical professionals. Second, we entered 20 clinical case vignettes on the ChatGPT platform and evaluated its accuracy compared to expert opinion and clinical course. Lastly, we compared the latest research version (v3.5; 27 September 2023) with a prior version (v3.5; 30 January 2023) to evaluate improvement over time. RESULTS: We found that ChatGPT latest version correctly answered 92% of the trivia questions, with slight variation in accuracy in the domains coronary artery disease (100%), pulmonary and venous thrombotic embolism (100%), atrial fibrillation (90%), heart failure (90%) and cardiovascular risk management (80%). In the 20 case vignettes, ChatGPT's response matched in 17 (85%) of the cases with the actual advice given. Straightforward patient-to-physician questions were all answered correctly (10/10). In more complex cases, where physicians (general practitioners) asked other physicians (cardiologists) for assistance or decision support, ChatGPT was correct in 70% of cases, and otherwise provided incomplete, inconclusive, or inappropriate recommendations when compared with expert consultation. ChatGPT showed significant improvement over time; as the January version correctly answered 74% (vs 92%) of trivia questions (p = 0.031), and correctly answered a mere 50% of complex cases.

       " Document(page_content='BACKGROUND: Cardiac allograft rejection is the leading cause of early graft failure and is a major focus of postheart transplant patient care. While histological grading of endomyocardial biopsy samples remains the diagnostic standard for acute rejection, this standard has limited diagnostic accuracy. Discordance between biopsy rejection grade and patient clinical trajectory frequently leads to both overtreatment of indolent processes and delayed treatment of aggressive ones, spurring the need to investigate the adequacy of the current histological criteria for assessing clinically important rejection outcomes. METHODS: N=2900 endomyocardial biopsy images were assigned a rejection grade label (high versus low grade) and a clinical trajectory label (evident versus silent rejection). Using an image analysis approach, n=370 quantitative morphology features describing the lymphocytes and stroma were extracted from each slide. Two models were constructed to compare the subset of features associated with rejection grades versus those associated with clinical trajectories. A proof-of-principle machine learning pipeline-the cardiac allograft rejection evaluator-was then developed to test the feasibility of identifying the clinical severity of a rejection event. RESULTS: The histopathologic findings associated with conventional rejection grades differ substantially from those associated with clinically evident allograft injury. Quantitative assessment of a small set of well-defined morphological features can be leveraged to more accurately reflect the severity of rejection compared with that achieved by the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation grades.

The aim of our study was to investigate the association between preterm birth and academic performance and intelligence in youth. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This cohort study included all liveborn children in Denmark from 1978 to 2000. We used uni- and multivariable logistic and linear regressions to analyze associations between gestational age and school graduation, grade point average (GPA), attending conscription, and male intelligence scores at conscription. We adjusted for a priori defined potential confounders. RESULTS: The study included 1 450 681 children and found an association between preterm birth and lower academic performance, with children born extremely preterm having the lowest odds of graduating from lower- and upper secondary education (LSE and USE) and appearing before the conscription board (odds ratios of 0.45 [0.38-0.54], 0.52 [0.46-0.59], and 0.47 [0.39-0.56] for LSE, USE, and conscription, respectively, compared to the term group). Statistically significant differences were observed in LSE for total GPA and core subject GPA with higher GPAs in the term group, which were considered clinically relevant for mathematics with a 0.71 higher grade point for the term compared to the extremely preterm. Conversely, USE differences were less evident, and in linear regression models we found that preterm birth was associated with higher GPAs in the adjusted analyses; however, this was not statistically significant. We demonstrated statistically significant differences in intelligence scores at conscription with lower scores in the three preterm groups (-5.13, -2.73, and - 0.76, respectively) compared to the term group. CONCLUSIONS: Low gestational age at birth was associated with not graduating from LSE and USE, achieving lower GPAs in LSE, not attending conscription, and lower intelligence scores in young adulthood.

       " Document(page_content='Establishing a brain biomarker for schizophrenia is strongly desirable not only to support diagnosis by psychiatrists but also to help track the progressive changes in the brain over the course of the illness. A brain morphological signature of schizophrenia was reported in a recent study and is defined by clusters of brain regions with reduced volume in schizophrenia patients compared to healthy individuals. This signature was proven to be effective at differentiating patients with schizophrenia from healthy individuals, suggesting that it is a good candidate brain biomarker of schizophrenia. However, the longitudinal characteristics of this signature have remained unclear. In this study, we examined whether these changes occurred over time and whether they were associated with clinical outcomes. We found a significant change in the brain morphological signature in schizophrenia patients with more brain volume loss than the natural, age-related reduction in healthy individuals, suggesting that this change can capture a progressive morphological change in the brain. We further found a significant association between changes in the brain morphological signature and changes in the full-scale intelligence quotient (IQ). The patients with IQ improvement showed preserved brain morphological signatures, whereas the patients without IQ improvement showed progressive changes in the brain morphological signature, suggesting a link between potential recovery of intellectual abilities and the speed of brain pathology progression.

This study aimed to evaluate the predictive power of gait disorders and gait-related neuropsychological performances for future AD diagnosis in aMCI through machine learning (ML). METHODS: A sample of 253 aMCI (stable, converter) individuals were included. We explored the predictive accuracy of four predictors (gait profile plus MMSE, DSST, and TMT-B) previously identified as critical for the conversion from aMCI to AD within a 36-month follow-up. Supervised ML algorithms (Support Vector Machine [SVM], Logistic Regression, and k-Nearest Neighbors) were trained on 70% of the dataset, and feature importance was evaluated for the best algorithm. RESULTS: The SVM algorithm achieved the best performance. The optimized training set performance achieved an accuracy of 0.67 (sensitivity = 0.72; specificity = 0.60), improving to 0.70 on the test set (sensitivity = 0.79; specificity = 0.52). Feature importance revealed MMSE as the most important predictor in both training and testing, while gait type was important in the testing phase. DISCUSSION: We created a predictive ML model that is capable of identifying aMCI at high risk of AD dementia within 36 months. Our ML model could be used to quickly identify individuals at higher risk of AD, facilitating secondary prevention (e.g., cognitive and/or physical training), and serving as screening for more expansive and invasive tests.

As this technology continues to be implemented in patient care, there is a growing need to understand the thoughts and experiences of stakeholders in this area to ensure that future AI development and implementation is successful. The aim of this study was to conduct a literature search of qualitative studies exploring the opinions of stakeholders such as clinicians, patients, and technology experts in order to establish the most common themes and ideas that have been presented in this research. METHODS: A literature search was conducted of existing qualitative research on stakeholder beliefs about the use of AI use in healthcare. Twenty-one papers were selected and analysed resulting in the development of four key themes relating to patient care, patient-doctor relationships, lack of education and resources, and the need for regulations. RESULTS: Overall, patients and healthcare workers are open to the use of AI in care and appear positive about potential benefits. However, concerns were raised relating to the lack of empathy in interactions of AI tools, and potential risks that may arise from the data collection needed for AI use and development. Stakeholders in the healthcare, technology, and business sectors all stressed that there was a lack of appropriate education, funding, and guidelines surrounding AI, and these concerns needed to be addressed to ensure future implementation is safe and suitable for patient care. CONCLUSION: Ultimately, the results found in this study highlighted that there was a need for communication between stakeholder in order for these concerns to be addressed, mitigate potential risks, and maximise benefits for patients and clinicians alike.

The objective of this study was to determine how ChatGPT evaluates developmental and behavioral pediatrics (DBP) case studies and makes recommendations and diagnoses. METHODS: ChatGPT was asked to list treatment recommendations and a diagnosis for each of 97 DBP case studies. A panel of 3 DBP physicians evaluated ChatGPT's diagnostic accuracy and scored treatment recommendations on accuracy (5-point Likert scale) and completeness (3-point Likert scale). Physicians also assessed whether ChatGPT's treatment plan correctly addressed cultural and ethical issues for relevant cases. Scores were analyzed using Python, and descriptive statistics were computed. RESULTS: The DBP panel agreed with ChatGPT's diagnosis for 66.2% of the case reports. The mean accuracy score of ChatGPT's treatment plan was deemed by physicians to be 4.6 (between entirely correct and more correct than incorrect), and the mean completeness was 2.6 (between complete and adequate). Physicians agreed that ChatGPT addressed relevant cultural issues in 10 out of the 11 appropriate cases and the ethical issues in the single ethical case.

       " Document(page_content='BACKGROUND: This scoping review\\'s aim is to provide a comprehensive overview of ecological momentary assessment (EMA)- based research on emotional labor (EL) as emotion regulation (ER). This includes an examination of the theoretical foundation this research builds on, how the hypothesized relationships are investigated using EMA methods as well as the studies\\' findings themselves. We built on the work of Grandey and Melloy (J Occup Health Psychol 22:407-22, 2004), who broadly distinguished between the two regulatory strategies of deep acting (DA) and surface acting (SA), embedded in a hierarchical model of emotional labor, as a guiding theory for structuring this review. METHODS: To be included, studies had to use EMA to measure SA or DA, with no restrictions regarding population and date of publication. The electronic databases CINAHL, PsycArticles, PsycINFO, PSYNDEX, Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science were searched. Studies were included if they met the above criteria and were written in English or German. Out of 237 publications, 12 were chosen for this review. RESULTS: All studies were based on emotional labor theories, with Arlie Hochschild\\'s theory being the most popular, followed by Alicia Grandey\\'s emotional labor theory and its modifications (Grandey AA. Emotion Regulation in the Workplace: A New Way to Conceptualize Emotional Labor; Grandey AA. When \"the show must go on\": Surface acting and deep acting as determinants of emotional exhaustion and peer-rated service delivery. 2003). The methodological quality of the studies varied greatly. The results of the studies indicate that SA is influenced by negative events, trait SA, service innovation and certain emotions, while DA is influenced by positive events and emotional intelligence. Emotional labor benefits the organization, e.g., by improving customer conflict handling, but also causes harm by increasing employee withdrawal behavior. For the employee, emotional labor results in more harm than benefits. CONCLUSIONS: The research area is still in its early stages and the findings are mostly consistent, but the small number of studies needs to be replicated to increase the reliability of the results. The lack of evidence for ertain hypotheses highlights the presence of unresolved relationships that require further exploration.

Vascular access (VA) quality is crucial for the well-being of hemodialysis (HD) patients, ensuring optimal blood transfer through a dialyzer machine. The ultrasound dilution technique (UDT) is used as the gold standard for assessing VA quality; however, its limited availability due to high costs impedes its widespread adoption. We aimed to develop a novel deep learning model specifically designed to predict VA quality from Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors. METHODS: Clinical data were retrospectively gathered from 398 HD patients, spanning from February 2021 to February 2022. The DeepVAQ model leverages a convolutional neural network (CNN) to process PPG sensor data, pinpointing specific frequencies and patterns that are indicative of VA quality. Meticulous training and fine-tuning were applied to ensure the model's accuracy and reliability. Validation of the DeepVAQ model was carried out against established diagnostic standards using key performance metrics, including accuracy, specificity, precision, F-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). RESULT: DeepVAQ demonstrated superior performance, achieving an accuracy of 0.9213 and a specificity of 0.9614. Its precision and F-score stood at 0.8762 and 0.8364, respectively, with an AUC of 0.8605.

However, validation studies mostly compare AI performance against radiologists, and there is relative paucity of evidence on the impact of AI assistance on other healthcare staff who review NCCTH in their daily clinical practice. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A retrospective data set of 150 NCCTH will be compiled, to include 60 control cases and 90 cases with intracranial haemorrhage, hypodensities suggestive of infarct, midline shift, mass effect or skull fracture. The intracranial haemorrhage cases will be subclassified into extradural, subdural, subarachnoid, intraparenchymal and intraventricular. 30 readers will be recruited across four National Health Service (NHS) trusts including 10 general radiologists, 15 emergency medicine clinicians and 5 CT radiographers of varying experience.

       " Document(page_content='PURPOSE:  In the last few years artificial intelligence (AI) has increasingly become a topic of interest, especially in diagnostic imaging. There are two main expected potential benefits: workflow effectiveness and diagnostic support systems, particularly as far as quality assurance is concerned. METHODS:  To meet these objectives, it is necessary to define what artificial intelligence in medicine means and to discuss which detailed steps should be fulfilled, e. g., for MSK imaging in the daily routine. In addition, this article provides an overview of what is necessary for an efficient IT-based workflow including the clinical question, the choice of modalities and investigation protocols, structured reports, and clinical classification. This is particularly interesting for potential providers, who are keen to apply new soft skills to support imaging diagnostic processes. RESULTS:  The use of AI-supported diagnostic imaging could result in a paradigm shift from a modality-oriented to a clinical problem-oriented workflow. In order to streamline trauma, degeneration, inflammation, and oncology-MSK diagnostic imaging, the potential benefits of AI-based workflow optimization should be taken advantage of. The following article describes a five-point plan combining patient expectations and specialized radiological standards with respect to investigation protocols and reports. Moreover, this AI-based strategy could help to improve interdisciplinary networking, e. g., boards etc., and facilitate the required leap in quality towards \"personalized precision medicine\" for the patient. According to the global discussion, there is a need to point out that it is not currently realistic to replace doctors with AI. KEY POINTS: . AI as support-system has a paramount clinical impact. . AI in the daily routine could be for work-flow-support (processing) - a physician-replacement is un-realistic yet. . Standardization of work-flow by AI could be an important contribution of quality assurance. CITATION FORMAT: . Braunschweig R, Kildal D, Janka R. Artificial intelligence (AI) in diagnostic imaging .

The continuing and automated processing of transient inputs shall constitute the basis of cognition and intelligence but may lead to neuropsychiatric disorders such as epileptic seizures if carried so far as to engross part of or the whole telencephalic system. From a conventional view of the basic design of the telencephalic local circuitry, the GABAergic interneurons (INs) and glutamatergic pyramidal neurons (PNs) make negative feedback loops which would regulate the neural activities back to the original state. The drive for the most intriguing self-perpetuating telencephalic activities, then, has not been posed and characterized. We found activity-dependent deployment and delineated functional consequences of the electrical synapses directly linking INs and PNs in the amygdala, a prototypical telencephalic circuitry. These electrical synapses endow INs dual (a faster excitatory and a slower inhibitory) actions on PNs, providing a network-intrinsic excitatory drive that fuels the IN-PN interconnected circuitries and enables persistent oscillations with preservation of GABAergic negative feedback. Moreover, the entities of electrical synapses between INs and PNs are engaged in and disengaged from functioning in a highly dynamic way according to neural activities, which then determine the spatiotemporal scale of recruited oscillating networks.

We applied machine learning models, specifically Decision Tree and Random Forest Regressors, along with Coupled-Matrix Tensor Factorisation (CMTF) and Elastic Net techniques, examining all possible combinations of these methods across different data modalities. The results demonstrated good performance for most biomarkers. On average, the models achieved Mean Squared Error (MSE) between 0.29 and 0.42 and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) between 0.23 and 0.45 for biomarkers like HDL, LDL, cholesterol, and HbA1c.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the feasibility of using generative AI tools to automate time-consuming and resource-intensive tasks in a systematic review process and assess the scope and limitations of using such tools. METHODS: We used the design science research methodology. The solution proposed is to use cocreation with a generative AI, such as ChatGPT, to produce software code that automates the process of conducting systematic reviews. RESULTS: A triggering prompt was generated, and assistance from the generative AI was used to guide the steps toward developing, executing, and debugging a Python script. Errors in code were solved through conversational exchange with ChatGPT, and a tentative script was created. The code pulled the mHealth solutions from the Google Play Store and searched their descriptions for keywords that hinted toward evidence base. The results were exported to a CSV file, which was compared to the initial outputs of other similar systematic review processes. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the potential of using generative AI to automate the time-consuming process of conducting systematic reviews of mHealth apps.

The study enrolled 16 US Board of Radiology-certified radiologists to perform radiological reading with (assisted) and without the software (unassisted). The study encompassed 199 retrospective cases, where each case consisted of a predosing baseline and a postdosing follow-up MRI of patients from aducanumab clinical trials PRIME, EMERGE, and ENGAGE. Statistical analysis was performed from April to July 2023. EXPOSURES: Use of icobrain aria, an AI-based assistive software for ARIA detection and quantification. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Coprimary end points were the difference in diagnostic accuracy between assisted and unassisted detection of ARIA-E (edema and/or sulcal effusion) and ARIA-H (microhemorrhage and/or superficial siderosis) independently, assessed with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). RESULTS: Among the 199 participants included in this study of radiological reading performance, mean (SD) age was 70.4 (7.2) years; 105 (52.8%) were female; 23 (11.6%) were Asian, 1 (0.5%) was Black, 157 (78.9%) were White, and 18 (9.0%) were other or unreported race and ethnicity. Among the 16 radiological readers included, 2 were specialized neuroradiologists (12.5%), 11 were male individuals (68.8%), 7 were individuals working in academic hospitals (43.8%), and they had a mean (SD) of 9.5 (5.1) years of experience. Radiologists assisted by the software were significantly superior in detecting ARIA than unassisted radiologists, with a mean assisted AUC of 0.87 (95% CI, 0.84-0.91) for ARIA-E detection (AUC improvement of 0.05 [95% CI, 0.02-0.08]; P = .001]) and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.78-0.87) for ARIA-H detection (AUC improvement of 0.04 [95% CI, 0.02-0.07]; P = .001). Sensitivity was significantly higher in assisted reading compared with unassisted reading (87% vs 71% for ARIA-E detection; 79% vs 69% for ARIA-H detection), while specificity remained above 80% for the detection of both ARIA types.

METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The ALIENOR Study is a cohort of French individuals 77 years of age or older. A multi-label DL model was developed to grade the presence of 7 clinical signs: large soft drusen (>125 mum), intermediate soft (63-125 mum), large area of soft drusen (total area >500 mum), presence of central soft drusen (large or intermediate), hyperpigmentation, hypopigmentation, and advanced AMD (defined as neovascular or atrophic AMD). Prediction performances were evaluated using cross-validation and the expert human interpretation of the clinical signs as the ground truth. RESULTS: A total of 1178 images were included in the study. Averaging the 7 clinical signs' detection performances, DeepAlienorNet achieved an overall sensitivity, specificity, and AUROC of 0.77, 0.83, and 0.87, respectively.

However, poor sensing abilities, an indispensable external energy supply, and limited material selection have significantly constrained their advancement. Herein, a self-powered flexible triboelectric sensor (TES) is proposed by integrating lotus-root-derived porous carbon (PC) into polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Owing to the superior charge capturing capability of PC, the PDMS/PC (PPC)-based TES exhibits an open-circuit voltage (V(oc)) of 22.8 V when it is periodically patted by skin at the pressure of 2 N and the frequency of 1 Hz, which is 5 times higher than that of a pristine PDMS-based TES. Furthermore, the as-prepared self-powered TES exhibits a high sensitivity of 3.24 V kPa(-1) below 15 kPa for detecting human motion signals, such as finger clicks, joint bends, etc. Last but not the least, after the assembly of a PPC-based TES array and construction of an HMI system, the robotic snake can be controlled remotely by recognizing finger touching signals.

       " Document(page_content='INTRODUCTION: Point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS) has emerged as an important tool for examining critically ill patients. POCUS devices have become progressively smaller and more accessible, transforming medical practice, and reducing costs. One technological breakthrough was the development of ultraportable scanners with microchip technology, which utilize a probe connected to a smartphone or tablet and incorporate a mobile application that employs artificial intelligence to assist in the interpretation of acquired images. The aim of this study was to compare the accuracy of ultrasound microchip technology with traditional piezoelectric crystal ultrasonography. We analyzed 2 volume status parameters in intensive care unit (ICU) patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) who were receiving kidney replacement therapy (KRT). These parameters were the extravascular pulmonary water, using the lung B-lines; and the inferior vena cava collapsibility index (IVCi). METHODS: Fifty critically ill patients met the study criteria. Lung POCUS quantified B-lines in 8 quadrants. The IVCi was measured using the maximum and minimum diameters during a respiratory cycle. Both technologies were sequentially employed in a randomized fashion to acquire the parameters at 2 different time points: before the initiation of KRT (T0) and 60 minutes after the procedure had commenced (T60). We calculated the correlation and agreement between the 2 ultrasound scanner modalities. RESULTS: The correlation between the 2 technologies for evaluating lung B-lines showed strong positive coefficients, ⍴ = 0.96 and ⍴ = 0.93 at T0 and T60, respectively (P < 0.001 for both). The correlation for IVCi was rho = 0.70 and rho = 0.87 at T0 and T60, respectively (P < 0.001 for both). The Bland-Altman plots showed agreement between ultrasound methods for IVCi calculation and B-line quantification. For IVCi calculation at T0, bias was +2.69 (SD: 10.6) (95% confidence interval [CI]: -18.13 to +23.52); at T60, bias was 3.28 (SD: 10.23) (95% CI: -16.77 to +23.34). For B-line quantification, the analysis yielded a bias of -0.3 (SD: 2.73), with a 95% CI of -5.66 to +5.06 at T0; and a bias of 0.2 (SD: 3.23), with a 95% CI of -6.14 to +6.54 at T60. CONCLUSION: Our study observed a good correlation and agreement between microchip and piezoelectric-based ultrasound modalities in evaluating the presence of pulmonary B-lines and inferior vena cava (IVC) dynamics in patients with AKI.

Here, we report an artificial intelligence (AI)-generated method for routinely measuring total kidney volume (TKV). METHODS: An ensemble U-net algorithm was created using the nnUNet approach. The training and internal cross-validation cohort consisted of all 1.5T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data acquired using 5 different MRI scanners (454 kidneys, 227 scans) in the CYSTic consortium, which was first manually segmented by a single human operator. As an independent validation cohort, we utilized 48 sequential clinical MRI scans with reference results of manual segmentation acquired by 6 individual analysts at a single center. The tool was then implemented for clinical use and its performance analyzed. RESULTS: The training or internal validation cohort was younger (mean age 44.0 vs. 51.5 years) and the female-to-male ratio higher (1.2 vs. 0.94) compared to the clinical validation cohort. The majority of CYSTic patients had PKD1 mutations (79%) and typical disease (Mayo Imaging class 1, 86%). The median DICE score on the clinical validation data set between the algorithm and human analysts was 0.96 for left and right kidneys with a median TKV error of -1.8%. The time taken to manually segment kidneys in the CYSTic data set was 56 (+/-28) minutes, whereas manual corrections of the algorithm output took 8.5 (+/-9.2) minutes per scan.

BRSET comprises 16,266 color fundus retinal photos from 8,524 Brazilian patients, aiming to enhance data representativeness, serving as a research and teaching tool. It contains sociodemographic information, enabling investigations into differential model performance across demographic groups. METHODS: Data from three Sao Paulo outpatient centers yielded demographic and medical information from electronic records, including nationality, age, sex, clinical history, insulin use, and duration of diabetes diagnosis. A retinal specialist labeled images for anatomical features (optic disc, blood vessels, macula), quality control (focus, illumination, image field, artifacts), and pathologies (e.g., diabetic retinopathy). Diabetic retinopathy was graded using International Clinic Diabetic Retinopathy and Scottish Diabetic Retinopathy Grading. Validation used Dino V2 Base for feature extraction, with 70% training and 30% testing subsets. Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Logistic Regression (LR) were employed with weighted training. Performance metrics included area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) and Macro F1-score. RESULTS: BRSET comprises 65.1% Canon CR2 and 34.9% Nikon NF5050 images. 61.8% of the patients are female, and the average age is 57.6 years. Diabetic retinopathy affected 15.8% of patients, across a spectrum of disease severity. Anatomically, 20.2% showed abnormal optic discs, 4.9% abnormal blood vessels, and 28.8% abnormal macula.

BACKGROUND: Seizures are frequent after ischemic strokes and are associated with increased mortality, poor functional outcomes, and lower quality of life. Separating patients at high risk of seizures from those at low risk of seizures is needed for treatment and clinical trial planning, but remains challenging. Machine learning (ML) is a potential approach to solve this paradigm. DESIGN/METHODS: We identified patients (aged >/=18 years) with IS without a prior diagnosis of seizures from 2015 until inception (08/09/22) in the TriNetX Research Network, using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) I63, excluding I63.6 (venous infarction). The outcome of interest was any ICD-10 diagnosis of seizures (G40/G41) at 1 year and 5 years following the index IS. We applied a conventional logistic regression and a Light Gradient Boosted Machine algorithm to predict the risk of seizures at 1 year and 5 years. The performance of the model was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC), the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), F1 statistic, model accuracy, balanced accuracy, precision, and recall, with and without anti-seizure medication use in the models. RESULTS: Our study cohort included 430,254 IS patients. Seizures were present in 18,502 (4.3%) and (5.3%) patients within 1 and 5 years after IS, respectively.

METHODS: The study employs a quantitative approach and utilizes three-wave data. Data were collected through the snowball sampling technique and a structured questionnaire survey. The sample comprises employees from 11 distinct organizations located in Guangdong Province, China. We received 301 valid questionnaires, representing an overall response rate of 75%. The theoretical model was tested through confirmatory factor analysis and regression analyses using Mplus and the Process macro for SPSS. RESULTS: The results indicate that positive affect mediates the positive relationship between challenge technology stressors and AI adoption intention, whereas AI anxiety mediates the negative relationship between hindrance technology stressors and AI adoption intention. Furthermore, the results reveal that technical self-efficacy moderates the effects of challenge and hindrance technology stressors on affective reactions and the indirect effects of challenge and hindrance technology stressors on AI adoption intention through positive affect and AI anxiety, respectively. CONCLUSION: Overall, our study suggests that AI-driven challenge technology stressors positively impact AI adoption intention through the cultivation of positive affect, while hindrance technology stressors impede AI adoption intention by triggering AI anxiety. Additionally, technical self-efficacy emerges as a crucial moderator in shaping these relationships. This research has the potential to make a meaningful contribution to the literature on AI adoption intention, deepening our holistic understanding of the influential mechanisms involved.

Machine learning offers promising computational and analytical solutions to interpret the biological meaning of large amounts of data in crops. In this study, we utilized multi-omics datasets from 156 maize recombinant inbred lines, containing 2496 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 46 image traits (i-traits) from 16 developmental stages obtained through an automatic phenotyping platform, and 133 primary metabolites. Based on benchmark tests with different types of prediction models, some machine learning methods, such as Partial Least Squares (PLS), Random Forest (RF), and Gaussian process with Radial basis function kernel (GaussprRadial), achieved better prediction for maize yield, albeit slight difference for method preferences among i-traits, genomic, and metabolic data. We found that better yield prediction may be caused by various capabilities in ranking and filtering data features, which is found to be linked with biological meaning such as photosynthesis-related or kernel development-related regulations. Finally, by integrating multiple omics data with the RF machine learning approach, we can further improve the prediction accuracy of grain yield from 0.32 to 0.43.

Cluster 1 (revision rate, 9.9%) patients were young (mean age, 22 years; SD, 6 years), received hamstring tendon (HT) autograft (91%), and had lower baseline Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) Sport and Recreation (Sports) scores (mean, 25.0; SD, 15.6). Cluster 2 (revision rate, 6.9%) patients received HT autograft (89%) and had higher baseline KOOS Sports scores (mean, 67.2; SD, 16.5). Cluster 3 (revision rate, 4.7%) patients received bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) or quadriceps tendon (QT) autograft (94%) and had higher baseline KOOS Sports scores (mean, 65.8; SD, 16.4). Cluster 4 (revision rate, 4.1%) patients received BPTB or QT autograft (88%) and had low baseline KOOS Sports scores (mean, 20.5; SD, 14.0). Cluster 5 (revision rate, 3.1%) patients were older (mean age, 42 years; SD, 7 years), received HT autograft (89%), and had low baseline KOOS Sports scores (mean, 23.4; SD, 17.6). CONCLUSION: Unsupervised learning identified 5 distinct KLR patient subgroups and each grouping was associated with a unique ACLR revision rate. Patients can be approximately classified into 1 of the 5 clusters based on only 3 variables: age, graft choice (HT, BPTB, or QT autograft), and preoperative KOOS Sports subscale score. If externally validated, the resulting groupings may enable quick risk stratification for future patients undergoing ACLR in the clinical setting. Patients in cluster 1 are considered high risk (9.9%), cluster 2 patients medium risk (6.9%), and patients in clusters 3 to 5 low risk (3.1%-4.7%) for revision ACLR.\", metadata={'PMID': '38343270', 'TI': 'Unsupervised Machine Learning of the Combined Danish and Norwegian Knee Ligament Registers: Identification of 5 Distinct Patient Groups With Differing ACL Revision Rates.', 'FAU': 'Martin, R Kyle Wastvedt, Solvejg Pareek, Ayoosh Persson, Andreas Visnes, Havard Fenstad, Anne Marie Moatshe, Gilbert Wolfson, Julian Lind, Martin Engebretsen, Lars', 'AU': 'Martin RK Wastvedt S Pareek A Persson A Visnes H Fenstad AM Moatshe G Wolfson J Lind M Engebretsen L', 'DP': Timestamp('2024-02-11 00:00:00'), 'MH': 'None', 'OT': 'ACL revision artificial intelligence machine learning outcome prediction unsupervised learning', 'PL': 'United States', 'JT': 'The American journal of sports medicine', 'PMC': 'None', 'EDAT': NaT, 'MHDA': NaT, 'STAT': 'Publisher'}),\n",

       " Document(page_content=\"In the realm of medical diagnostics, the utilization of deep learning techniques, notably in the context of radiology images, has emerged as a transformative force. The significance of artificial intelligence (AI), specifically machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), lies in their capacity to rapidly and accurately diagnose diseases from radiology images. This capability has been particularly vital during the COVID-19 pandemic, where rapid and precise diagnosis played a pivotal role in managing the spread of the virus. DL models, trained on vast datasets of radiology images, have showcased remarkable proficiency in distinguishing between normal and COVID-19-affected cases, offering a ray of hope amidst the crisis. However, as with any technological advancement, vulnerabilities emerge. Deep learning-based diagnostic models, although proficient, are not immune to adversarial attacks. These attacks, characterized by carefully crafted perturbations to input data, can potentially disrupt the models' decision-making processes. In the medical context, such vulnerabilities could have dire consequences, leading to misdiagnoses and compromised patient care. To address this, we propose a two-phase defense framework that combines advanced adversarial learning and adversarial image filtering techniques. We use a modified adversarial learning algorithm to enhance the model's resilience against adversarial examples during the training phase. During the inference phase, we apply JPEG compression to mitigate perturbations that cause misclassification. We evaluate our approach on three models based on ResNet-50, VGG-16, and Inception-V3. These models perform exceptionally in classifying radiology images (X-ray and CT) of lung regions into normal, pneumonia, and COVID-19 pneumonia categories. We then assess the vulnerability of these models to three targeted adversarial attacks: fast gradient sign method (FGSM), projected gradient descent (PGD), and basic iterative method (BIM). The results show a significant drop in model performance after the attacks. However, our defense framework greatly improves the models' resistance to adversarial attacks, maintaining high accuracy on adversarial examples. Importantly, our framework ensures the reliability of the models in diagnosing COVID-19 from clean images.\", metadata={'PMID': '38343214', 'TI': 'Robust Medical Diagnosis: A Novel Two-Phase Deep Learning Framework for Adversarial Proof Disease Detection in Radiology Images.', 'FAU': 'Haque, Sheikh Burhan Ul Zafar, Aasim', 'AU': 'Haque SBU Zafar A', 'DP': Timestamp('2024-01-10 00:00:00'), 'MH': 'None', 'OT': 'Adversarial examples COVID-19 Deep learning Medical images Robustness', 'PL': 'Switzerland', 'JT': 'Journal of imaging informatics in medicine', 'PMC': 'None', 'EDAT': NaT, 'MHDA': NaT, 'STAT': 'Publisher'}),\n",

Subsequently, we aimed to evaluate the ability of these scores to predict meaningful pathological and perioperative outcomes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 300 patients with preoperative CT with early arterial contrast phase were identified from a cohort of 544 consecutive patients undergoing surgical extirpation for suspected renal cancer. A deep neural network approach was used to automatically segment kidneys and tumours, and then geometric algorithms were used to measure the components of the concordance index (C-Index), Preoperative Aspects and Dimensions Used for an Anatomical classification of renal tumours (PADUA), and tumour contact surface area (CSA) nephrometry scores. Human scores were independently calculated by medical personnel blinded to the AI scores. AI and human score agreement was assessed using linear regression and predictive abilities for meaningful outcomes were assessed using logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curve analyses. RESULTS: The median (interquartile range) age was 60 (51-68) years, and 40% were female. The median tumour size was 4.2 cm and 91.3% had malignant tumours. In all, 27% of the tumours were high stage, 37% high grade, and 63% of the patients underwent partial nephrectomy. There was significant agreement between human and AI scores on linear regression analyses (R ranged from 0.574 to 0.828, all P < 0.001).

       " Document(page_content=\"With the advancement of technology, the demand for increased production efficiency has gradually risen, leading to the emergence of new trends in agricultural automation and intelligence. Precision classification models play a crucial role in helping farmers accurately identify, classify, and process various agricultural products, thereby enhancing production efficiency and maximizing the economic value of agricultural products. The current MobileNetV2 network model is capable of performing the aforementioned tasks. However, it tends to exhibit recognition biases when identifying different subcategories within agricultural product varieties. To address this challenge, this paper introduces an improved MobileNetV2 convolutional neural network model. Firstly, inspired by the Inception module in GoogLeNet, we combine the improved Inception module with the original residual module, innovatively proposing a new Res-Inception module. Additionally, to further enhance the model's accuracy in detection tasks, we introduce an efficient multi-scale cross-space learning module (EMA) and embed it into the backbone structure of the network. Experimental results on the Fruit-360 dataset demonstrate that the improved MobileNetV2 outperforms the original MobileNetV2 in agricultural product classification tasks, with an accuracy increase of 1.86%.\", metadata={'PMID': '38342930', 'TI': 'Classification and identification of agricultural products based on improved MobileNetV2.', 'FAU': 'Chen, Haiwei Zhou, Guohui He, Wei Duan, Xiping Jiang, Huixin', 'AU': 'Chen H Zhou G He W Duan X Jiang H', 'DP': Timestamp('2024-02-11 00:00:00'), 'MH': 'None', 'OT': 'None', 'PL': 'England', 'JT': 'Scientific reports', 'PMC': 'PMC10859362', 'EDAT': NaT, 'MHDA': NaT, 'STAT': 'PubMed-not-MEDLINE'}),\n",

       " Document(page_content=\"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop and evaluate an automatic model using artificial intelligence (AI) for quantifying vascular involvement and classifying tumor resectability stage in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), primarily to support radiologists in referral centers. Resectability of PDAC is determined by the degree of vascular involvement on computed tomography scans (CTs), which is associated with considerable inter-observer variability. METHODS: We developed a semisupervised machine learning segmentation model to segment the PDAC and surrounding vasculature using 613 CTs of 467 patients with pancreatic tumors and 50 control patients. After segmenting the relevant structures, our model quantifies vascular involvement by measuring the degree of the vessel wall that is in contact with the tumor using AI-segmented CTs. Based on these measurements, the model classifies the resectability stage using the Dutch Pancreatic Cancer Group criteria as either resectable, borderline resectable, or locally advanced (LA). RESULTS: We evaluated the performance of the model using a test set containing 60 CTs from 60 patients, consisting of 20 resectable, 20 borderline resectable, and 20 locally advanced cases, by comparing the automated analysis obtained from the model to expert visual vascular involvement assessments. The model concurred with the radiologists on 227/300 (76%) vessels for determining vascular involvement. The model's resectability classification agreed with the radiologists on 17/20 (85%) resectable, 16/20 (80%) for borderline resectable, and 15/20 (75%) for locally advanced cases. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that an AI model may allow automatic quantification of vascular involvement and classification of resectability for PDAC. RELEVANCE STATEMENT: This AI model enables automated vascular involvement quantification and resectability classification for pancreatic cancer, aiding radiologists in treatment decisions, and potentially improving patient outcomes.

However, the conventional preoperative planning, a two-dimensional method using X-ray template, has shown poor reliability of predicting component size. To our knowledge, artificial intelligence technology assisted three-dimensional preoperative planning is promising to improve the accuracy of preoperative planning but there is a dearth of clinical evidence. Therefore, in this study we compared the prediction accuracy of these two maneuvers. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study consisting of 117 consecutive patients who underwent a primary cementless total hip arthroplasty to compare the prediction accuracy of these two methods. The two-dimensional and artificial intelligence assisted three-dimensional planning results of the same patient were compared with the definitive implant size respectively. RESULTS: The prediction accuracy of artificial intelligence assisted three-dimensional planning for cup and the stem sizes were 66.67% (78/117) and 65.81% (77/117), two-dimensional planning was 30.77% (36/117) and 37.61% (44/117) (p < 0.05). There were poor prediction results of two-dimensional planning in patients with hip dysplasia (p = 0.004, OR = 7.143) and excessive femoral anteversion (p = 0.012, OR = 1.052), meanwhile the failure risk of stem side two-dimensional planning increased as patients got older (p = 0.003, OR = 1.118). The accuracy of artificial intelligence assisted three-dimensional planning cannot be affected by above factors.

METHODS: a retrospective analysis of 160 patients with a biopsy proven EIN. We analyzed the performance of multiple machine learning models (n = 48) with different parameters to predict the diagnosis of postoperative EC. The prediction variables included: parity, gestations, sampling method, endometrial thickness, age, body mass index, diabetes, hypertension, serum CA-125, preoperative histology and preoperative hormonal therapy. Python 'sklearn' library was used to train and test the models. The model performance was evaluated by sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and AUC. Five iterations of internal cross-validation were performed, and the mean values were used to compare between the models. RESULTS: Of the 160 women with a preoperative diagnosis of EIN, 37.5% (60) had a post-op diagnosis of EC. In univariable analysis, there were no significant predictors of EIN. For the five best machine learning models, all the models had a high specificity (71%-88%) and a low sensitivity (23%-51%).

The highest area under the curve was achieved by the random forest model 0.646. CONCLUSIONS: Even using the most elaborate AI algorithms, it is not possible currently to predict concurrent EC in women with a preoperative diagnosis of EIN.

       " Document(page_content=\"INTRODUCTION: Chat-GPT is rapidly emerging as a promising and potentially revolutionary tool in medicine. One of its possible applications is the stratification of patients according to the severity of clinical conditions and prognosis during the triage evaluation in the emergency department (ED). METHODS: Using a randomly selected sample of 30 vignettes recreated from real clinical cases, we compared the concordance in risk stratification of ED patients between healthcare personnel and Chat-GPT. The concordance was assessed with Cohen's kappa, and the performance was evaluated with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) curves. Among the outcomes, we considered mortality within 72 h, the need for hospitalization, and the presence of a severe or time-dependent condition. RESULTS: The concordance in triage code assignment between triage nurses and Chat-GPT was 0.278 (unweighted Cohen's kappa; 95% confidence intervals: 0.231-0.388). For all outcomes, the ROC values were higher for the triage nurses. The most relevant difference was found in 72-h mortality, where triage nurses showed an AUROC of 0.910 (0.757-1.000) compared to only 0.669 (0.153-1.000) for Chat-GPT.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A mixed-method analysis was conducted at 2 pilot sites. Interviews were conducted with 12 of 27 enrolled patients and with 13 participating clinicians. iPARIHS constructs were used for interview construction to identify workflow, communication patterns, and clinician's beliefs. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed using inductive coding protocols to identify key themes. Behavioral response data from the AI-generated notifications were collected. RESULTS: Clinicians responded to notifications within 24 hours in 95% of instances, with 26.7% resulting in clinical action. Four implementation themes emerged: (1) High anticipatory expectations for reliable patient communications, reduced patient burden, and less proactive provider monitoring. (2) The AI notifications required a differential and tailored balance of trust and action advice related to role. (3) Clinic experience with other home-based programs influenced utilization. (4) Responding to notifications involved significant effort, including electronic health record (EHR) review, patient contact, and consultation with other clinicians.

       " Document(page_content='BACKGROUND: Dental caries, also known as tooth decay, is a widespread and long-standing condition that affects people of all ages. This ailment is caused by bacteria that attach themselves to teeth and break down sugars, creating acid that gradually wears away at the tooth structure. Tooth discoloration, pain, and sensitivity to hot or cold foods and drinks are common symptoms of tooth decay. Although this condition is prevalent among all age groups, it is especially prevalent in children with baby teeth. Early diagnosis of dental caries is critical to preventing further decay and avoiding costly tooth repairs. Currently, dentists employ a time-consuming and repetitive process of manually marking tooth lesions after conducting radiographic exams. However, with the rapid development of artificial intelligence in medical imaging research, there is a chance to improve the accuracy and efficiency of dental diagnosis. METHODS: This study introduces a data-driven model for accurately diagnosing dental decay through the use of Bitewing radiology images using convolutional neural networks. The dataset utilized in this research includes 713 patient images obtained from the Samin Maxillofacial Radiology Center located in Tehran, Iran. The images were captured between June 2020 and January 2022 and underwent processing via four distinct Convolutional Neural Networks.

Artificial intelligence (AI) assistants could potentially aid in providing answers to farmers' questions. The objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of an AI chatbot assistant (ChatGPT) to provide quality responses to farmers' questions. We compiled a list of 32 questions related to irrigated rice cultivation from farmers in Kano State, Nigeria. Six EAs from the state were randomly selected to answer these questions. Their answers, along with those of ChatGPT, were assessed by four evaluators in terms of quality and local relevancy. Overall, chatbot responses were rated significantly higher quality than EAs' responses. Chatbot responses received the best score nearly six times as often as the EAs' (40% vs. 7%). The evaluators preferred chatbot responses to EAs in 78% of cases. The topics for which the chatbot responses received poorer scores than those by EAs included planting time, seed rate, and fertilizer application rate and timing. In conclusion, while the chatbot could offer an alternative source for providing agricultural advisory services to farmers, incorporating site-specific input rate-and-timing agronomic practices into AI assistants is critical for their direct use by farmers.\", metadata={'PMID': '38341517', 'TI': \"Evaluating responses by ChatGPT to farmers' questions on irrigated lowland rice cultivation in Nigeria.\", 'FAU': 'Ibrahim, Ali Senthilkumar, Kalimuthu Saito, Kazuki', 'AU': 'Ibrahim A Senthilkumar K Saito K', 'DP': Timestamp('2024-02-10 00:00:00'), 'MH': 'Humans *Oryza Nigeria Artificial Intelligence Farmers Software', 'OT': 'None', 'PL': 'England', 'JT': 'Scientific reports', 'PMC': 'PMC10858882', 'EDAT': NaT, 'MHDA': NaT, 'STAT': 'MEDLINE'}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='OBJECTIVE: To assess whether artificial intelligence, inspired by clinical decision-making procedures in delivery rooms, can correctly interpret cardiotocographic tracings and distinguish between normal and pathological events. STUDY DESIGN: A method based on artificial intelligence was developed to determine whether a cardiotocogram shows a normal response of the fetal heart rate to uterine activity (UA). For a given fetus and given the UA and previous FHR, the method predicts a fetal heart rate response, under the assumption that the fetus is still in good condition and based on how that specific fetus has responded so far. We hypothesize that this method, when having only learned from fetuses born in good condition, is incapable of predicting the response of a compromised fetus or an episode of transient fetal distress. The (in)capability of the method to predict the fetal heart rate response would then yield a method that can help to assess fetal condition when the obstetrician is in doubt. Cardiotocographic data of 678 deliveries during labor were selected based on a healthy outcome just after birth. The method was trained on the cardiotocographic data of 548 fetuses of this group to learn their heart rate response. Subsequently it was evaluated on 87 fetuses, by assessing whether the method was able to predict their heart rate responses. The remaining 43 cardiotocograms were segment-by-segment annotated by three experienced gynecologists, indicating normal, suspicious, and pathological segments, while having access to the full recording and neonatal outcome. This future knowledge makes the expert annotations of a quality that is unachievable during live interpretation. RESULTS: The comparison between abnormalities detected by the method (only using past and present input) and the annotated CTG segments by gynecologists (also looking at future input) yields an area under the curve of 0.96 for the distinction between normal and pathological events in majority-voted annotations. CONCLUSION: The developed method can distinguish between normal and pathological events in near real-time, with a performance close to the agreement between three gynecologists with access to the entire CTG tracing and fetal outcome.

CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the legacy approach, software-assisted sign-out improves Banff accuracy and fidelity, more closely correlates with kidney function, is practical for routine clinical work and translational research studies, facilitates downstream integration with nonpathology data, and readies biopsy scoring for artificial intelligence algorithms.', metadata={'PMID': '38340346', 'TI': 'Banff scoring of kidney allograft biopsies: \"Manual\" application vs software-assisted sign-out.', 'FAU': 'Demetris, Anthony J Lesniak, Andrew J Popp, Benjamin A Frencho, Ronald J Minervini, Marta I Nalesnik, Michael A El Hag, Mohamed I Hariharan, Sundaram Randhawa, Parmjeet S', 'AU': 'Demetris AJ Lesniak AJ Popp BA Frencho RJ Minervini MI Nalesnik MA El Hag MI Hariharan S Randhawa PS', 'DP': Timestamp('2024-02-10 00:00:00'), 'MH': 'None', 'OT': 'Banff kidney allograft scoring digital pathology pathology informatics software-assisted sign-out', 'PL': 'England', 'JT': 'American journal of clinical pathology', 'PMC': 'None', 'EDAT': NaT, 'MHDA': NaT, 'STAT': 'Publisher'}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='BACKGROUND: The emergence of artificial intelligence, capable of human-level performance on some tasks, presents an opportunity to revolutionise development of systematic reviews and network meta-analyses (NMAs). In this pilot study, we aim to assess use of a large-language model (LLM, Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 [GPT-4]) to automatically extract data from publications, write an R script to conduct an NMA and interpret the results. METHODS: We considered four case studies involving binary and time-to-event outcomes in two disease areas, for which an NMA had previously been conducted manually. For each case study, a Python script was developed that communicated with the LLM via application programming interface (API) calls. The LLM was prompted to extract relevant data from publications, to create an R script to be used to run the NMA and then to produce a small report describing the analysis. RESULTS: The LLM had a > 99% success rate of accurately extracting data across 20 runs for each case study and could generate R scripts that could be run end-to-end without human input. It also produced good quality reports describing the disease area, analysis conducted, results obtained and a correct interpretation of the results. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a promising indication of the feasibility of using current generation LLMs to automate data extraction, code generation and NMA result interpretation, which could result in significant time savings and reduce human error.

This study aimed to assess whether GPT-4 could be used to automatically programme two published health economic analyses. METHODS: The two analyses were partitioned survival models evaluating interventions in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). We developed prompts which instructed GPT-4 to programme the NSCLC and RCC models in R, and which provided descriptions of each model's methods, assumptions and parameter values. The results of the generated scripts were compared to the published values from the original, human-programmed models. The models were replicated 15 times to capture variability in GPT-4's output. RESULTS: GPT-4 fully replicated the NSCLC model with high accuracy: 100% (15/15) of the artificial intelligence (AI)-generated NSCLC models were error-free or contained a single minor error, and 93% (14/15) were completely error-free. GPT-4 closely replicated the RCC model, although human intervention was required to simplify an element of the model design (one of the model's fifteen input calculations) because it used too many sequential steps to be implemented in a single prompt. With this simplification, 87% (13/15) of the AI-generated RCC models were error-free or contained a single minor error, and 60% (9/15) were completely error-free. Error-free model scripts replicated the published incremental cost-effectiveness ratios to within 1%. CONCLUSION: This study provides a promising indication that GPT-4 can have practical applications in the automation of health economic model construction.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The files of patients presenting with distal ureteral stones were retrospectively evaluated. Those who experienced spontaneous passage were assigned to Group P, while those who did not were assigned to Group N. Demographic and clinical data of both groups were compared. Then, logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the factors predicting spontaneous stone passage. Based on these factors, a logistic regression model was prepared, and artificial intelligence algorithms trained on the dataset were compared with this model to evaluate the effectiveness of artificial intelligence in predicting spontaneous stone passage. RESULTS: When comparing stone characteristics and NCCT findings, it was found that the stone size was significantly smaller in Group P (4.9 +/- 1.7 mm vs. 6.8 +/- 1.4 mm), while the ureteral diameter was significantly higher in Group P (3.3 +/- 0.9 mm vs. 3.1 +/- 1.1 mm) (p < 0.05). Parameters such as stone HU, stone radiopacity, renal pelvis AP diameter, and perirenal stranding were similar between the groups. In multivariate analysis, stone size and alpha-blocker usage were significant factors in predicting spontaneous stone passage.

However, robust evidence is still lacking because this was mainly based on retrospective studies, in which patients were included when TE was suspected. METHODS: All patients with COVID-19 pneumonia underwent computed tomography and pulmonary angiography in a prospective study. The main objective was to determine the number and percentage of thrombi surrounded by lung opacification (TSO) in each patient, as well as their relationship with percentage of lung involvement (TLI), to distinguish classical TE (with a random location of thrombi that should correspond to a percentage of TSO equivalent to the TLI) from PT. We determined TLI by artificial intelligence. Analyses at patient level (TLI and percentage of TSO) and at thrombi level (TLI and TSO) were performed. RESULTS: We diagnosed TE in 70 out of 184 patients. Three (2-8) thrombi/patient were detected. The percentage of TSO was 100% (75-100) per patient, and TLI was 19.9% (4.6-35.2).

       " Document(page_content='OBJECTIVES: Although there have been remarkable strides in fetal medicine and prenatal diagnosis of congenital heart disease, a significant percentage of newborns with isolated coarctation of the aorta (CoA) - around 60 percent - are still not identified prior to birth. The prenatal detection of CoA has been shown to have a notable impact on the survival rates of affected infants. To this end, the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in fetal ultrasound may represent a groundbreaking advancement. Our hypothesis is that leveraging automated cardiac biometric measurements with AI during the 18-22-week anomaly scan will enhance the identification of fetuses that are at risk of developing CoA. METHODS: We have developed an AI model capable of identifying standard cardiac planes and conducting automated cardiac biometric measurements. Our data consisted of pregnancy ultrasound image and outcome data spanning from 2008 to 2018 and collected from four distinct regions in Denmark. The CoA cases from the period were paired with healthy controls in a ratio of 1:100 and matched on gestational ages of +/-2 days. The cardiac biometrics on the four-chamber view and three vessel view were included in a logistic regression-based prediction model. To assess the predictive capabilities, we visualized sensitivity and specificity on Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: At the 18-22 week scan, the right ventricle (RV)area and length, left ventricle (LV) width, and the ratios of RV/LV areas and main pulmonary artery/ascending aorta diameters showed significant differences with z-scores above 0.7 when comparing subjects with a postnatal diagnosis of CoA (n=73) and healthy controls (n=7300). Using logistic regression and backward feature selection, our prediction model produced a ROC curve with an AUC (Area Under the Curve) of 0.96 and a specificity of 88.9% at a sensitivity level of 90.4%. CONCLUSION: The integration of AI technology with automated cardiac biometric measurements conducted during the 18-22-week anomaly scan in fetal medicine has the potential to substantially enhance the screening for fetal CoA and subsequently the rate of CoA detection.

However, the success of DNNs for indoor localization depends on the availability of a large amount of pre-processed and labeled data for training, the collection of which could be time-consuming in large-scale indoor environments and even challenging during a pandemic situation like COVID-19. To address these issues in data collection, we investigate multi-dimensional RSSI data augmentation based on the Multi-Output Gaussian Process (MOGP), which, unlike the Single-Output Gaussian Process (SOGP), can exploit the correlation among the RSSIs from multiple access points in a single floor, neighboring floors, or a single building by collectively processing them. The feasibility of MOGP-based multi-dimensional RSSI data augmentation is demonstrated through experiments using the hierarchical indoor localization model based on a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-i.e., one of the state-of-the-art multi-building and multi-floor localization models-and the publicly available UJIIndoorLoc multi-building and multi-floor indoor localization database. The RNN model trained with the UJIIndoorLoc database augmented with the augmentation mode of \"by a single building\", where an MOGP model is fitted based on the entire RSSI data of a building, outperforms the other two augmentation modes and results in the three-dimensional localization error of 8.42 m.', metadata={'PMID': '38339745', 'TI': 'Multi-Dimensional Wi-Fi Received Signal Strength Indicator Data Augmentation Based on Multi-Output Gaussian Process for Large-Scale Indoor Localization.', 'FAU': 'Tang, Zhe Li, Sihao Kim, Kyeong Soo Smith, Jeremy S', 'AU': 'Tang Z Li S Kim KS Smith JS', 'DP': Timestamp('2024-02-05 00:00:00'), 'MH': 'None', 'OT': 'Multi-Output Gaussian Process (MOGP) data augmentation indoor localization large-scale building complex location fingerprinting regression', 'PL': 'Switzerland', 'JT': 'Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)', 'PMC': 'PMC10857661', 'EDAT': NaT, 'MHDA': NaT, 'STAT': 'PubMed-not-MEDLINE'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The development of emerging information technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), edge computing, and blockchain, has triggered a significant increase in IoT application services and data volume. Ensuring satisfactory service quality for diverse IoT application services based on limited network resources has become an urgent issue. Generalized processor sharing (GPS), functioning as a central resource scheduling mechanism guiding differentiated services, stands as a key technology for implementing on-demand resource allocation. The performance prediction of GPS is a crucial step that aims to capture the actual allocated resources using various queue metrics. Some methods (mainly analytical methods) have attempted to establish upper and lower bounds or approximate solutions. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) methods, such as deep learning, have been designed to assess performance under self-similar traffic. However, the proposed methods in the literature have been developed for specific traffic scenarios with predefined constraints, thus limiting their real-world applicability. Furthermore, the absence of a benchmark in the literature leads to an unfair performance prediction comparison. To address the drawbacks in the literature, an AI-enabled performance benchmark with comprehensive traffic-oriented experiments showcasing the performance of existing methods is presented. Specifically, three types of methods are employed: traditional approximate analytical methods, traditional machine learning-based methods, and deep learning-based methods. Following that, various traffic flows with different settings are collected, and intricate experimental analyses at both the feature and method levels under different traffic conditions are conducted.

This article presents a novel architecture that integrates PUF, blockchain, and Tangle for Security-by-Design (SbD) of healthcare cyber-physical systems (H-CPSs). Healthcare systems around the world have undergone massive technological transformation and have seen growing adoption with the advancement of Internet-of-Medical Things (IoMT). The technological transformation of healthcare systems to telemedicine, e-health, connected health, and remote health is being made possible with the sophisticated integration of IoMT with machine learning, big data, artificial intelligence (AI), and other technologies. As healthcare systems are becoming more accessible and advanced, security and privacy have become pivotal for the smooth integration and functioning of various systems in H-CPSs. In this work, we present a novel approach that integrates PUF with IOTA Tangle and blockchain and works by storing the PUF keys of a patient's Body Area Network (BAN) inside blockchain to access, store, and share globally. Each patient has a network of smart wearables and a gateway to obtain the physiological sensor data securely. To facilitate communication among various stakeholders in healthcare systems, IOTA Tangle's Masked Authentication Messaging (MAM) communication protocol has been used, which securely enables patients to communicate, share, and store data on Tangle. The MAM channel works in the restricted mode in the proposed architecture, which can be accessed using the patient's gateway PUF key. Furthermore, the successful verification of PUF enables patients to securely send and share physiological sensor data from various wearable and implantable medical devices embedded with PUF. Finally, healthcare system entities like physicians, hospital admin networks, and remote monitoring systems can securely establish communication with patients using MAM and retrieve the patient's BAN PUF keys from the blockchain securely.

In off-limits mountains, a human rarely exists, thus human detection is an extremely rare event. Due to the advances in artificial intelligence, object detection-classification algorithms based on a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) can be used for this application. However, considering off-limits mountains, there should be no person in general. Thus, it is not desirable to run object detection-classification algorithms continuously, since they are computationally heavy. This paper addresses a time-efficient human detector system, based on both motion detection and object classification. The proposed scheme is to run a motion detection algorithm from time to time. In the camera image, we define a feasible human space where a human can appear. Once motion is detected inside the feasible human space, one enables the object classification, only inside the bounding box where motion is detected. Since motion detection inside the feasible human space runs much faster than an object detection-classification method, the proposed approach is suitable for real-time human detection with low computational loads. As far as we know, no paper in the literature used the feasible human space, as in our paper. The outperformance of our human detector system is verified by comparing it with other state-of-the-art object detection-classification algorithms (HOG detector, YOLOv7 and YOLOv7-tiny) under experiments. This paper demonstrates that the accuracy of the proposed human detector system is comparable to other state-of-the-art algorithms, while outperforming in computational speed.

      "page_content='OBJECTIVE: This work aims to study the profiles of Long COVID from the perspective of the patients spontaneously sharing their experiences and symptoms on Reddit. METHODS: We collected 27,216 posts shared between July 2020 and July 2022 on Long COVID-related Reddit forums. Natural language processing, clustering techniques and a Long COVID symptoms lexicon were used to extract the different symptoms and categories of symptoms and to study the co-occurrences and correlation between them. RESULTS: More than 78% of the posts mentioned at least one Long COVID symptom. Fatigue (29.4%), pain (22%), clouded consciousness (19.1%), anxiety (17.7%) and headaches (15.6%) were the most prevalent symptoms. They also highly co-occurred with a variety of other symptoms (e.g., fever, sinonasal congestion). Different categories of symptoms were found: general (45.5%), neurological/ocular (42.9%), mental health/psychological/behavioral (35.2%), body pain/mobility (35.1%) and cardiorespiratory (31.2%). Posts focusing on other concerns of the community such as vaccine, recovery and relapse and, symptom triggers were detected. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the benefits of leveraging large volumes of data from Reddit to characterize the heterogeneity of Long COVID profiles. General symptoms, particularly fatigue, have been reported to be the most prevalent and frequently co-occurred with other symptoms. Other concerns, such as vaccination and relapse following recovery, were also addressed by the Long COVID community.' metadata={'PMID': '37663849', 'TI': \"The Long COVID experience from a patient's perspective: a clustering analysis of 27,216 Reddit posts.\", 'FAU': 'Ayadi, Hanin Bour, Charline Fischer, Aurelie Ghoniem, Mohammad Fagherazzi, Guy', 'AU': 'Ayadi H Bour C Fischer A Ghoniem M Fagherazzi G', 'DP': NaT, 'MH': 'Humans *COVID-19/epidemiology Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome Cluster Analysis Fatigue Pain', 'OT': 'Long COVID artificial intelligence digital health machine learning natural language processing patient-reported outcomes public health social media', 'PL': 'Switzerland', 'JT': 'Frontiers in public health', 'PMC': 'PMC10470115', 'EDAT': NaT, 'MHDA': NaT, 'STAT': 'MEDLINE'}\n"
